vote for me!
tom graduated from high school in 2013.
don't forget us.
this isn't enough.
i know that story.
tom leaned up against me.
what does all this add up to?
i'm sick of boston.
his handwriting is poor.
please open your books to page 86.
i admit it.
i rode on the back of my friend's bicycle.
she helped her daughter get dressed.
i don't think so.
he's absorbed in his work.
this camera was expensive.
"i tried to reach you on the phone, but i was unable to get through."
he attended to his business.
fortran is a programming language.
i'll send you the link when i get home.

they were all surprised to see me there.
i've quit drinking beer.
"there isn't much i can do to help, i'm afraid."
thanks for coming.
he dashed out of the store.
i think tom is smart.
how did you like the movie?
i'll do it later on.
we work from nine to five.
the bus has already gone.
the news that the president was killed surprised them.
tell him to wait.
tom takes a pill with vitamins and minerals every day.
probably no one will notice.
tom is absent.
i know what to do.
she selected a hat to match her new dress.
tom only drinks coffee.
i'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow.
i will accompany you.
customers stopped coming to our shop.
it's too cold today for a picnic.
let's talk next time.
she became aware that her parents were watching her.
that's not very important to me.
thank you for your invitation.
don't walk so fast. i can't keep up with you.
is this french?
we usually call him tom.
tom and i disagreed on that point.
"i remembered your birthday this year, didn't i?"
i'm making a paper airplane.
i hope you have a good time in europe.
"in high school, the girl that i had a crush on had a crush on tom."
thank you for your detailed explanation.
there's a small possibility that tom will be arrested.
"my dad doesn't drink. ""mine doesn't either."""
i thought that you were from boston.
tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
he was too embarrassed to do it.
"i was hungry, so i ate."
i can't believe tom left without saying goodbye.
why not go?
hamburgers have gone up this week.
the clock is ticking.
i took a long trip last year.
he seems to know nothing about the matter.
doing that wasn't as easy as i expected.
are we going to cross this bridge?
what kind of a person does something like that?
you should prepare for tomorrow's lessons.
tom didn't tell us his last name.
hunting is forbidden in national parks.
it would've been nice if you'd helped me a little.
my dad would like to meet you.
we're eating dinner now.
are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
what're you doing now?
i'll solve that problem.
he must be the one for me.
i could hardly tell who was who.
i can run.
that was interesting.
why are tom and mary here?
"in ancient times, plagues killed many people."
don't tell me you don't like chocolate.
they were all sold out.
"i can hear you, but i can't see you."
i worked on it day after day.
would you please go shopping with me?
i never noticed that.
my shoes are worn out.
i'm sorry to interrupt you.
no rich people live here.
there was a lot of snow last winter.
i've never thought about it.
let me know once you've decided when you'll come.
you should've seen the movie last night.
i'd like to have another cup of coffee.
i don't mind reading manuals.
we had a quick lunch at a cafe.
do you think i should quit my job?
that isn't my cup of tea.
i don't even know how old tom is.
i lost my way in the woods.
tom promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
you ought to write a book.
the evidence is clear.
be calm.
i enjoyed driving on the new highway.
we want to learn some spanish songs.
"tom loved singing. however, no one wanted to listen to him sing."
it took a long time for me to get used to the noise.
you don't have to make excuses.
could you please take a picture?
"it is very cold today, isn't it?"
they're always complaining.
i don't have an older sister.
neither tom nor mary can speak french.
"the first artificial satellite was sputnik 1, launched by russia in 1957."
this dress suits you well.
mary is 36 weeks pregnant.
how old is this church?
we love you.
"the world is unfair, isn't it?"
i was out all day.
i think it's worth a try.
you are the only one who can carry the bag.
"my sister hasn't come home yet, so my mother is worried."
don't keep me waiting.
tom fixed the flat tire by himself.
what are you reading?
tom looks cool no matter what he wears.
he called me a cab.
i asked him to do that.
i wonder whether tom knows that mary can't speak french.
i'm amazed at his rapid progress in english.
they won't believe me.
my mom thought i'd be a football player.
the child threw a stone at the dog.
i'm on good terms with the neighbors.
this is a small token of my gratitude.
three people are missing.
he left for new york a week ago.
tom said that he didn't like my dress.
what're you looking for?
why do i need to go to boston?
she promised her father to be in time for lunch.
the question is who will do it.
i've known it all along.
is there a similar proverb in japan?
what is in the garden?
do you all have pencils?
even japanese can make mistakes when they speak japanese.
there is a tv in this room.
this could become a serious problem.
my wet clothes clung to my body.
i feel very sick. i want to throw up.
i had the gardener plant some trees.
i dropped out of school when i was in the 7th grade.
i've heard all about it.

"she seems reserved, but she's actually a strong-willed person."
was the party fun?

"in that case, i think you should come in today."
i like tom because he's honest.
there are a great many books in this library.

thank you in advance for your help.
i'm as busy as ever.
math is really hard.
he was somewhat disappointed to hear the news.

i slid down the banister.
"sorry, but i can't go with you."

i found a stone shaped like a heart.
tom opened a can of ice-cold root beer and poured it over his ice cream.

i am a twin.
how about going for a drive?
i can't find the price tag.
she has no manners.
"i found the work easy, since i had done that kind of work before."

we have time to spare.
the man couldn't so much as write his own name.
you can stay as long as you like.

i say this from my own experience.
the man standing over there is the owner of the store.
why did you break up?
the parents succeeded in calming him down.
he came home late last night.
this zipper doesn't zip smoothly.
i think tom doesn't want to tell us the truth.
are you twins?

he is tired of reading.
"you like girls, don't you?"
my head aches.
tom was so busy.
"having a slight cold, i went to bed early."
what did he do today?
i'll try harder next time.
"no matter what happens, i'll stand by you."
please sit at the table.
tom looked relieved.
is it true tom and mary got arrested?
don't let him touch it.
"i'm very sorry, but i can't."

tom can only speak a little french.
most people are right-handed.

"if i can come again tomorrow, i will."
is it too late?
i asked mary what she wanted to do.
when was the last time we talked?
i went to the supermarket.
do you have a cheaper room?

wake up.
"i thought you might be lonely, so i came over with a bottle of wine."
his failure was due to his idleness.
how do you use this camera?
it is said that smoking is bad for your health.
i'm worn out.
fresh vegetables promote health.
this is what my mother gave me when i got married.

"hurry up, or you'll miss your plane."
may i ask you something personal?
"mama, is it okay if i go swimming?"
tom has been secretly in love with mary for a long time.

the next class starts in five minutes.
he is good at diving.

he caught my hand and pulled me to the second floor.

i got up early in order to catch the first train.
it's not easy to catch a rabbit with your bare hands.
i've loved you for a long time.
i don't think that this shirt goes with that red tie.
my son is going to be a teacher.

that's a popular question.
he cleared out his desk.
tom and mary are about the same size.
i like playing sports.

"being exhausted, she was soon fast asleep."
please go back to your seats.
i can't help you move the piano because i have a bad back.
but i don't think it's at all odd.
he got lost in the city.
i am determined to carry out this plan.
do you like playing in the dirt?
what time will you come pick me up?
we've won!
it snowed hard yesterday.
i'm sober.
my father never hits me on the head.
what's the difference between religion and philosophy?
let me carry that box for you.
everyone wants money.
i didn't do it.
i found this book by chance in a secondhand bookstore.
tom gave me this shirt.
use acrylic paint.
his horse jumped over the fence.
my wife showed excellent taste in decorating the room.
do your homework now.
he will be only too glad to help you.
how wide is this road?
take the medicine three times a day.
i'm not the man i was when you first knew me.
i'll be right back.
is it ok to use this?
i really had an enjoyable childhood.

i'm fine.
i don't need a lawyer.
how much is the most expensive car?
will you run for governor?
come a little closer.
do you like to dance?
may i borrow your dictionary?
don't dump garbage here.
i heard tom sneezing.
he is far from rich.
i applied for a visa.
"even though tom is only sixteen, he looks like he's over twenty."
the grass is wet.
i was up almost all night.
tom and mary got married just three months after they met.
that shop sells newspapers and magazines.
she continued with the work.
"because the entrance was locked, we couldn't enter the house."
we didn't expect so many people to come.
everybody knows that two and two make four.
i thought as much.
do you have seasonal allergies?
i like chess.
we are flying over the pacific.
why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
he is writing a letter to his parents now.
i was thinking about her.
"when i was a child, i could sleep anywhere."
i'd like to come along if you don't mind.
"foreigners are interesting, aren't they?"
thousands of people were there.
i warned you.
english is spoken in many countries around the world.
"if you drink warm milk before you go to bed, it'll help you fall asleep."
tom is a very rude man.
everyone is wearing a mask.
we don't get snow here very often.
i think tom is narrow-minded.
have you ever sung in public?
i should've read that book.
i didn't need your help.
let me in.
the headlight doesn't work.
he promised me that he would come at four.
she appeared to have forgotten my name.
let me try to explain.
in no way is he a man of character.
all three of those men are carpenters.
i heard someone whistle.
we don't care what he does.
would you lend me your bicycle?
i can't eat that much food by myself.
i'd like to be alone.
thanks for making me laugh.
where's the information counter?
her red dress made her stand out.
are you through with the newspaper?
is this your bicycle?
he is by nature a generous person.
i want to keep this house as it is.
i was amazed at tom's fluency in french.
what's today's plan?
how did tom get to know mary?
feel free to share your thoughts.
tom might never walk again.
take as many peaches as you want.
that's real convenient.
"in the late eighteenth century, a passport for an american was usually signed by the president of the united states."
i don't think tom would buy that.
i like fish more than meat.
i drank two cups of coffee.
tom isn't as rich as mary.
i have a driver's license.
i thought we could eat out on the patio.
"if you need money, i'll lend you some."
he always speaks ill of his father behind his back.
what seems to be the problem today?
there are three suitcases near the door.
i could not sleep because of the noise.
i bought this t-shirt on sale.
i'm pleased to meet you.
where did you see that woman?
let's do it again.
where did i put the key?
i don't know how to buy a ticket.
are you getting bored?
i hated french in high school.
you look sick.
i'm not a child any longer.
please give me a band-aid and some medicine.
tom doesn't want to talk to anyone.
she takes piano lessons once a week.
i think you can get it.
i need another three hundred dollars to buy what i want.
i went shopping in town today.
thank you for your work.
tom waited for the kettle to boil.
"sometimes i say ""yes,"" even though i want to say ""no."""
don't start with that again.
i wonder whether tom will go to boston or not.
london is small compared to tokyo.
the jet plane had 500 passengers on board.
"if only i had a map, i could show you the way."
how's tom's neck?
the bell is ringing.
we tried to make out the letters written on the wall.
does anybody have a charger for an iphone?
are you still not feeling well?
it was because i was ill that i couldn't go to school yesterday.
that song always reminds me of my childhood.
three times five is fifteen.
i arrived here at eight this morning.

you don't need to worry about such a thing.
please write your name with a pencil.
i'm eating now.
the line is still busy.
tom flipped off the lights.
cool off!
are you tom's friend?
this bread is very good.
the waitress spread a white cloth over the table.
tom came out of the room last.
what's the exchange rate today?
she had hardly begun to read the book before someone knocked at the door.
i'm just beginning.
i had a snack before i went back to work.
what do you usually eat for breakfast?
he agrees with my opinion.
i found that restaurant by accident.
"to be honest with you, i don't like tom."
please pass the note around.
he likes that teacher.
i'd like to see it.
you'd better not waste your money.
the train arrived at the station thirty minutes behind schedule.
why don't you come inside?
tom never goes anywhere by himself.
i burned myself with boiling water.
one of tom's friends was killed in a traffic accident.
have you bought your ticket already?
do you think fish can hear?
tom tossed mary the ball.
she managed to drive a car.
which side won?
i'm not carrying any cash.
are you hurt?
i like taking walks.
he always leaves for work at 8:00 a.m.
we were all rather exhausted.
i don't know what went wrong.
the tape recorder was on the table.
"if we unite our efforts, we'll be able to finish this."
next year my birthday will fall on sunday.
he couldn't go out because of the snow.
he's washing his car.
thank you for your concern.
don't kick the door open.
i saw a girl with long hair.
what's for dessert?
can you think of a better idea than this one?
do you believe that god exists?
are there any french-speaking doctors working here?
i see.
i'll be home all day today.
you don't need to worry about such a thing.
i wrote my name on a piece of paper.
my brother has a part-time job in a library.
i took off my sweater because it got warmer.
your french is very good. where did you learn it?
that software was released six months ago.
hang on one second.
he wrote to his parents.
at least 100 people attended.
tom has shaved off his mustache.
i have no idea how to deal with my daughter.
turn in your homework.
you're much taller than you used to be.
he dropped in on me last night.
what lovely flowers!
the day's already over.
we'd like to confirm our reservations.
"how many push-ups can you do, tom? ""i used to be able to do a hundred easily, but i wonder how many i can do now. maybe 50 or so?"""
i can't go with you today because i'm very busy.
tom bought a six-room house.
my older sister's marriage has finally been arranged.
this bread is freshly baked.
they eat meat once a week.
you won't be able to catch the train.
"today's your birthday, right?"
this is a pretty big deal.
i went to the park to play.
our daughter will be in the shichi-go-san festival this year.
tom was stung by a bee.
he is the last man to break his promise.
would you like to come along?
do you catch colds often?
tom looked in the refrigerator.
i wish tom hadn't told mary that i'd been in prison.
send me a copy of the report.
"i've met you before, but i can't remember where."
hold your tongue!
tom comes to boston once a year.
is it true tom's father is famous?
do you really hide your money under the mattress?
tom knows mary doesn't like raw eggs.
a cat was sharpening its claws against a post.
is anyone coming besides your friends?
tom was a good husband and a wonderful father.
may i sit down?
i ordered new furniture.
did you buy those books?
i apologize for being late.
it isn't very difficult.
you'll never defeat me.
whose umbrella is this?
give me what you have in your hand.
where's the nearest museum?
the school is within walking distance of my house.
please take a look at this picture.
i have no money.
i'm ready to roll up my sleeves.
i couldn't make out what he was saying.
there are no rules without exceptions.
this picture was taken by him.
tom loves french.
it's time to reflect on your past.
i gave a speech at the wedding yesterday.
he knows close to nothing about this issue.
i don't think this shirt goes with that red tie.
i sold my books cheaply.
tom and mary lived in boston for a time.
i know well what tom wants.
she opened the door.
it's easy to see the fireworks from over there.
my grandma bent over to pick up a needle and thread.
tom looked at his watch.
should i have my tooth extracted?
tom says that he's hungry.
it will be winter before long.
tom is always bad-mouthing mary.
i prefer history to geography.
my mother is preparing dinner.
i don't want to go to school tomorrow.
let's keep this matter between ourselves.
tom and mary are the same height.
i'll do whatever i can to help you.
let's exchange phone numbers.
she spends time with her grandmother every sunday.
i asked tom to go there.
i spent my vacation at the beach.
you should go.
i'm going to play tennis.
tom is the captain of this baseball team.
the rumor may be true.
i have to use french all day.
my waist size has recently increased. i guess it's middle-age spread.
he is acting for the chief director.
this chair is too low for me.
the pond is 3 meters deep.
i'll see that it never happens again.
he underwent a risky operation.
he left for london the day before yesterday.
it's too soon to tell.
she gave her father a tie.
"if it's raining tomorrow, let's go by car."
"close your eyes, and listen carefully."
he turned his back on the old tradition.
i told tom that i'd get him a gift.
i'm glad i was able to help.
i can take care of yours truly.
"you've read the report, haven't you?"
it isn't mine.
i went to the zoo.
this mountain is covered with snow all year round.
tom loved mary very much.
let's help her.
she has to stop smoking.
how old were you when you learned to write your name?
my mom doesn't speak english very well.
do you have any employees who speak french?
everyone froze.
she is playing with her friends.
i think tom's grandmother is too old to wear a miniskirt.
i need to do some shopping since christmas is almost here.
no sooner had she caught sight of me than she started running in my direction.
it is good to be kind to old people.
when did you go there?
"no matter how much i think about it, i can't understand it."
it's a great idea.
did tom reply?
won't you come in and have a cup of tea?
tom and mary are talking in the kitchen.
so much has happened. it's as if the whole world is flipped upside down.
we run the store jointly.
"the people here are particular about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it'll soon go out of business if the food doesn't taste good."
he was hit by a car.
i'm feeling blue today.
i have a favor to ask of you.
eight is two times four.
don't ask me for money.
i found it difficult to solve the problem.
i want to be that doctor's patient.
"a few minutes later, the telephone rang."
they had no food.
"may i have the check, please?"
do you believe in ufos?
time flies.
i have to wait.

i'm having a blast.
we have no children.
there's an easier way to do it.
i'm going to my friend's place.

"give me the bill, please."
i bought a six-pack of beer on my way home from work.

i don't want to say any more than that.
i had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert.

i'm at a loss what to do.
it's sort of strange.
who knows what will happen tomorrow?
my annual income exceeds five million yen.
don't sass me.
it was a quick decision.
it is very kind of you to say so.
tom fainted.
are you angry?
please wait a moment.
would you like to come over to our house for dinner?
she turned off the lights.
thank you for the coffee.
i don't want to tell you my name.

i'm already accustomed to sitting on tatami.
is there any place around here where i can rent a bicycle?
i can't kiss you now.
japan and britain are island countries.
the room was full of people.
don't get mad.
she has an advantage over me.
it was necessary.
"perseverance, as you know, is the key to success."
i still want to go.
"on hearing the news, tom fainted."
"oh, don't worry about that."
a small stream runs by my house.

i now want to drink beer.
"hurry up, tom."
her english is excellent.
i think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.

you're kind to say so.
tom is allergic to cats.
were you at home last night?
i'm looking for someone to fall in love with.
he dreamed about his home.
this road is too narrow for trucks to pass.
"tom, please open the door."
i'm going to see her off at the airport at 2:00.

that was a smart move.
are you doing well?
i think this is a great system.
i don't want to go outside this afternoon.
both tom and mary aren't very good at cooking.
tom crossed the street.
i'm not afraid.
it's a big house.
tom said that mary wanted to do that yesterday.
you know it's a lie.
it was such a hot day that we went swimming.
a cold beer would hit the spot!
how come you didn't come to the party?
not every man can be happy.
i don't think it'll stop raining.
tom's wife's a friend of mine.

tom was standing just in front of a large building that was up for sale.
everything tom predicted came true.
do you have a fever?
do i have to come home now?
i've been bitten.
i waited an hour.
i guess you can't do that.
i call him tom.
i went for a walk with my son.
i'm sorry to hear that your father passed away.
please wait at home.
i want to hug you.
do you know where the scissors that were here are?
falling rocks present a danger to climbers.

"tom, i found the picture you were looking for."
i approve.
tom took a seat next to mary.
"we waited for tom at the library for thirty minutes, but he never showed up."
it was after midnight when we arrived.
you don't have to use such a harsh tone with me.
no student of mine would do such a thing.
why does tom always wear sunglasses?
i thought it was something like that.
i think that tom likes you.
who's with tom?
you both did well.
i'm not sure how much they are expecting me to donate.

what does that mean?
i won the first prize.
i know the girl over there quite well.
what's in your pockets?
tom peeled the apple.
there wasn't much news in last night's newspaper.
the problem is whether my parents will agree or not.

this box is too heavy for me to carry.
write down your name here.
drop by my office any time.
i was looking for you.
i'm nothing but a poor peasant.
tom knew where i was.
this milk tastes sour.
"you've never been in love, have you?"
let's begin with that question.
have you been here before?
i'll call you up around eight this evening.
i wrote a letter to my parents at home.
i'm a little dizzy.
tom sits at his computer eight hours a day.
i agree with you completely.

we have thirty-two teeth.

set a thief to catch a thief.
i have no time to engage in gossip.
say it again.
"he was making a speech, but he abruptly stopped speaking when he heard a strange noise."
i'd like to try.
my wife and i both grew up in boston.
who's that?
he is used to walking long distances.
"it is rather cold again today, but tomorrow we expect the temperature to rise."
don't say that.
tom swore that he didn't tell anybody our secret.
put this in your pocket.
he is a strange person.
the pain went away because i took the pills.
tom turned up the tv.
do i have to change my diet?
i passed by your house about 10 last night.
that's not important to me.

a fire broke out inside the movie theater.
make it quick.
that's tom's.
get out of my way.

they invited me to play cards.
it's my brother's.
a monster was believed to live in the cave.
it's raining really hard right now.
does tom have a license?
that didn't really happen.
most of the people here can speak french.
look for it online.
i met tom last summer.
many would envy you.
profit is better than fame.
that guy is always asking his parents for money.
"please write down your name, address, and phone number here."
why are you so dressed up? where are you going?
nobody can see this movie without being moved.
fear often exaggerates danger.
this box contains five apples.
"please, tell me."
this is an urgent matter.
"the door was locked, so i couldn't open it."
tom is my father-in-law.
"your name and flight number, please?"
i remember meeting you somewhere.
take only what you need.
i'm a tv addict.
are you related?
this is the first time i've driven a car.
do you have matches?
put it there.
tom didn't like mary.
thank you for your purchase.
the shirt you gave me fits perfectly.
are there many animals in the zoo?
he laid down the gun.
the fact is that they don't have enough money.
"life isn't fair, is it?"
i'm going to meet mary this afternoon.
i will ask him about it tomorrow.
i forgot to bring my umbrella with me.
the red dress made her stand out.
tom didn't want to bother mary while she was studying.
she fell from the tree.

who said yes?

a button came off when i was playing baseball.
i'm going to buy a dog tomorrow.
we've run out of cheese.
"if it rains tomorrow, i'll stay home."
i'll be at your place in an hour.

i want him to leave.
my parents said that i was too young to do that.
we're beyond the point where just apologizing is enough.
i work out.
you can get it at a bookstore.
i'd like to have tom over for dinner.
"help yourself, please."
have you ever had sushi?
we had a lively party last night.
how many cigarettes do you smoke every day?
all the boys are the same age.
is there any chance that tom will get arrested?
that is a table.
it wasn't tom who did that.
we found it hard to change the plan.
i'm feeling nervous.
that's the way the ball bounces.
i don't have a hundred dollars.
i'll do the work tomorrow.
he's three years older than i am.
he is an unsung hero.
the ring couldn't be found anywhere.
this table has a smooth surface.
do you really think tom can win?
half of the bananas in the basket were rotten.
the party went on for three hours.
i don't want an apology. i want an explanation.
i want more.
a day has twenty-four hours.
you'll find domestic articles on the third floor.
the kids are playing outside.
i'd rather stay home this weekend.
i'm very happy now.
i turned off my phone.
were you crying?
i heard an interesting rumor.
i haven't had my breakfast yet.
avoid sugary drinks.
what do you think?
mary wore a pale blue dress.
he doesn't study as hard as he used to.
"according to the paper, there was a big fire in boston."
that no longer matters.
i really enjoyed yesterday.
let's go to a movie.
i hope your mother gets well soon.
she accompanied her friend to the concert.
there was a steady increase in population.
tokyo is a very big city.
can i try doing that again?
i'm going back to australia tomorrow.
that's not altogether bad.
i don't want to burden you with my troubles.
your french is really good. where did you study?
that's exactly what he said.
"i love this town, especially in the spring."
i asked where to go.
i'm off beer.
we look forward to seeing you again.
"when i got home, my mother and father were fighting."
"while there is life, there is hope."
where are the toilets?
mary wore her favorite necklace.
why is everyone speaking so quietly?
can i stay the night?
what would you do if you were in my place?
the room was cleaned by tom.
thanks for rescuing me.
"if it snows on the mountain, it's cold in the valley."
i often travel.
i was quite shocked by this.
i am thankful for my friends.
i wrote a letter.
i don't like math very much.
i prefer tea to coffee.
thanks for the cookies.
who coaches the team?
is tom still at home?

tom is a bully.
when did you get back?
tom shut the door and locked it.
i have a card up my sleeve.
tom thinks volleyball is more fun than basketball.
i understand what you're trying to say.
"it was hot today, wasn't it?"
he looks like his mother.
has he come yet?
"having met him before, i recognized him at once."
tom isn't as fat as mary.
tom was on good terms with mary.
is that tom?
what have you been up to recently?
were you able to find the book?
do you like parmesan cheese on spaghetti?
put on your pants.
tom and i walked to school together.
tom speaks three languages.
our town has excellent sports facilities.
when was the last time you had your hair cut?
what is your name?
i've wanted to meet him for a long time.
i left around 2:30.
that's enough for today.
i like hot springs off the beaten track.
i need a couple of empty cardboard boxes.
no way!
you can do whatever you want to.
emojis were first introduced in 1999 by japanese artist shigetaka kurita.
i don't think that tom is a billionaire.
put out the light.
excuse me. where's the library?
have a good time.
elephants are herbivores.
i have some idea of what happened.
i don't know whether to turn left or right.
here is a blanket.
it's just two miles to the town.
the floor was covered with dust.
illness prevented her from taking a trip.
war broke out in 1941.
this room is very warm.
he went on talking as though nothing had happened.

is there a nonstop flight to boston?
this doll costs only sixty cents.
do you see anything?
i bought a six-pack of beer on my way home from work.
tom married mary.
where is the toilet?
i'd like to take a small trip this weekend.
tom is out now.
is there snow on top of the mountain?
is tom complaining?
"where have you been? ""i've been to the dentist."""
i have a date tonight with an old girlfriend.
it was hard to resist the impulse to wring tom's neck.
i'll be here.
these are too hot.
are you finished?
i think this is amazing.
would you join me for a walk?
i don't think that tom is the killer.
ask me something easier.
"last year, i spent so much time by myself that i almost forgot how to communicate effectively with others."
i can't do two things at a time.
does everybody have a pencil?
"if the weather is nice, i'll go out tomorrow."
it can't be true.
tom was jealous of mary's success.
my father died four years ago.
is there really nothing left?
i'll try to fix it.
why are you all still awake?
i love her.
i respect my teacher very much.
my father visited my uncle in the hospital.
you'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
i spent three months compiling this data.
i'm not sleepy yet.
"apparently, the murder happened in a locked room."
tom considers himself good-looking.
i regret not having taken his advice.
are you ok? you look like you're about to cry.
i think that my french is pretty good.
i'd like to play tennis with you some day.
nobody's died.
"you write very neatly, don't you?"
he didn't give me anything to eat.
i'll give you one last chance.
it'll rain tomorrow.
she kicked him.
how long did tom work here?
tom is sleeping on the couch.
i beg your pardon?
i think tom is a really nice guy.
this button is loose.
the man suddenly started shooting his gun.
the price of eggs is going up.
tom didn't want to hurt anybody.
no one knows the reason.
is this bike tom's?
i need to leave a bit early.
it's quite old.
does this hurt?
you must learn english whether you like it or not.
someone is coming.
tom's translations aren't very good.
i'll probably get there in the afternoon.
i would like to meet him.
i wonder whether or not tom is able to understand french.
excuse me.
we have a test tomorrow.
thanks for the wonderful meal.
i told her once and for all that i would not go shopping with her.
i accepted the offer after due consideration.
i know why he did it.
have you ever seen a koala?
the man passed by without so much as glancing at her.
i was having a bath when the telephone rang.
where did you pick up your french?
we went down the river in a small boat.
they sent for the doctor.
tom grabbed mary by the hair.
i'll show you the way to the station.
stop harassing us.
i heard the sound of a ringing bell.
why are you still here?
you don't have to be an artist to find the beauty in everyday life.
"could i use your dictionary? ""of course."""
we weren't invited to the party.
he almost never gets angry.
what did you do today?
someone stole my jacket.
i like the flavor of mushrooms.
i've eaten.
i'll do this.
can i sit here?
i go to a driving school.
tom says he wants to learn how to fly an airplane.
it's really horrible.
we'll have little snow this winter.
why did you decide to become a teacher?
how beautiful she is!
i wish i hadn't bought so much.
there's an orange on the table.
i'd like you to tell me the truth.
i'll let you know beforehand.
i've got to be careful.
turn the radio up a little.
i keep a diary in english.
the house was very badly built.
tom borrowed some money from mary.
our dog was nearly run over by a car.
i want mary.
i'm not sure when i'll be back.
my mobile phone is broken.
"all of a sudden, the lights went out."
tom took a bite out of the apple.
this book is tom's.
he seated himself beside her.
the boy grew up to be a famous musician.
he pointed to the tower over there.
that's the stupidest thing i've ever said.
tom has to have surgery.
tom has gone away.
"he donated $10,000 to the refugee fund."
that's an original idea.
i set up motion sensors.
i'll be watching you.
i'm very sleepy now.
i haven't had lunch yet.
i never thought it would be like this.
i got wet.
it was not my mistake.
i knew that tom was standing behind the curtain.
this is the house which was designed by a famous architect.
jump across.
i'm not sure when tom will get back.
come early tomorrow.
people usually don't like what they can't understand.
don't work too hard!
i hope that it doesn't rain tomorrow.
tom tends to exaggerate.
are you still in australia?
i must've caught a cold.
explaining the risks is very important.
it's next to that building.
tom should tell mary what to buy.
"at last, he realized his mistakes."
never bite the hand that feeds you.
i really like staying home.
what do you do for a living?
my grandfather usually eats breakfast at six.
tom turned the lights on.
we all like cycling.
do you like talking?
we're programmers.
you can't take pictures in the theater without permission.
i'm still at work.
tom is intelligent.
"if it were me, i wouldn't do that."
when's the lunch break?
have you run into some kind of trouble?
tom couldn't figure out where the money came from.
have you ever eaten anything that tom's cooked?
do you want milk and sugar?
tom is supposed to be here by now.
my mother is on a banana diet.
he was robbed of all his money.
i need a shave.
the two teams competed in the final game.
tom doesn't like changing for p.e.
"i'm busy, so i can't go."
i still owe my brother the ten dollars that he lent me last week.
"if i'd known you were sick, i would've visited you in the hospital."
tom has been dating mary for at least six months.
i seldom go to boston.
tom is going to write a letter.
i fell asleep reading a book.
my older brother made all the preparations for us.
why haven't you done that yet?
don't spend your money on stupid things.
this house has triple-pane windows.
i've been wanting to go there for a while.
i don't want to attend the party.
"why aren't you going? ""because i don't want to."""
i'm afraid i cannot make myself understood in english.
she sat next to him and listened quietly.
this is a japanese camera.
the taxi will be here soon.
i'm going to get divorced.
you've never asked me about it.
i've known that a long time.
tom ran at full speed.
he said he wanted to go to bed.
all of us should go.
i was born and raised in tokyo.
i'm a teacher.
let's get down to work.
writing a love letter isn't easy.
i'm ok.
it has become much warmer.
tom wanted his own room.
tom doesn't have enough experience to operate a train.
we've got plenty of time.
how is the weather today?
tom showed his room to me.
it's a very common name.
i met tom's parents.
"if you want a ticket, please raise your hand."
tom barely studied for the exam.
please return to your seat.
the wind is blowing east.
which hospital are you in?
i'm not always home on sundays.
i didn't do that yesterday because i had a bad headache.
i thought that i asked you to clean the living room.
there is no tv in my room.
i don't know what you mean.
tom tried to save mary's life.
i'm dying for frozen yogurt.
never be this late again.
is this really a shortcut?
"i wanted tom to stay longer, but he had to leave."
that's awfully convenient.
where's the nearest pharmacy?
what do you think of that?
he brought his speech to an end.
do you go to an elementary school?
do you have your own room?
the boy was silent.
has he failed again?
i don't want to be involved in that matter.
it was time for a change.
the supreme court overturned a previous decision.
driving for one and a half hours to get to work is a bear.
have you ever argued with your parents?
is that your room?
i lost my glasses.
this work is difficult for us.
let me introduce myself.
the road turns left there.
tom grabbed mary by the throat and started choking her.
you have too many books on that shelf.
please clear the way.
which one is tom's?
what does the other party want?
nobody's expecting us to win.
i've decided to do that by myself.
why do you think so?
"it was more expensive than i thought it would be, but it was really delicious."
a lot of villagers were killed by soldiers.
i want to eat something healthy.
i hardly ever walk to work.
i want something to read on the train.
this has nothing to do with you.
were you speeding?
nobody says anything.
"she tried to get a tent at the shop, but she could not find the one she wanted."
wait right there.
he has lost his job.
i want to own my own shop.
i would like to talk with you about this matter.
a new school building is under construction.
let me know when you are leaving. we can go together.
"there was an earthquake and, in addition, there was a tsunami."
i love cucumber salad.
the dog follows me wherever i go.
he was sitting on a bench with his eyes closed.
is this the first time that you've been here?
i didn't notice tom had gone.
can you give me a lift to the station?
tom and mary said they wanted to find an apartment close to where they work.
tom wasn't able to find mary.
i have a severe pain here.
can you swim as fast as he can?
everybody is waiting for you.
tomorrow's my birthday.
tom lost.
we often went skiing in the winter.
please send it by special delivery.
he ran away at the sight of a policeman.
the law doesn't apply to this case.
i don't think that he will come.
it took us three hours to come to a conclusion.
when was this tree planted?
my guess is that it will be fine tomorrow.
you don't have to work on sundays.
i think she'll help me.
she translated it word for word.
i paid $200 in taxes.
"last summer, i worked part time on a farm."
i often read books.
could you give me a better price?
i'd like to live in a warmer climate.
that doesn't concern you.
it's easy to get lost.
it was because of the storm that the trains were halted.
tom lives here alone.
i don't know where i should go.
i've never smoked before.
is this going to take long?
i remember that place.
haven't you eaten lunch?
i'm glad that i was able to help.
"as soon as she opened the door, a white dog ran out of the house."
tom is kind to everybody.
he has a good reputation.
let me help.
won't you come with me?
it is no use crying over spilt milk.
most of my friends are already married.
it seems to me that we should go now.
tom made a birdhouse.
the chicken was delicious.
"as it is, prices are going up every week."
i went home in order to change my clothes.
at least you didn't hurt yourself.
i'd like to become a better person.
tom got along well with mary.
this is the school where my father used to go.
put your masks on.
we like playing in the mud.
why is no one eating?
there are many words with meanings i don't know.
i managed to get out of the crowd.
"on weekdays, there are always fewer people."
"we tried several things, but nothing worked."
don't be noisy in this room.
"i want to have a part-time job, too."
"once in a while, we should take a step back and think."
the general feeling is that it's wrong.
"mom, that hairstyle makes you look old."
she asked after my parents' health when i met her the other day.
what a strange guy!
she watched the children swimming in the pool.
do you know when his plane is arriving?
i thought this building had a sprinkler system.
it's already ten o'clock. my mother must be angry.
he's a high school student.
"with car prices so high, now is the worst time to buy."
a storm is brewing.
we depend on you.
"as a kid, i could sleep anywhere."
let's have pizza for lunch today.
i commute to work by bicycle.
i know that tom is a control freak.
i've given up smoking.
this coffee is too strong for me.
i agree with your opinion.
what was tom's last name?
iceland used to belong to denmark.
i thought this was just a story for children.
i had to wait for over three hours.
the summer vacation ended all too soon.
"let's buy tom a car for his graduation present. ""that's a great idea."""
i'll contact you later.
tom is shorter than mary is.
how old are you?
tom is an interpreter.
he returned back home after being away for ten months.
how did it come about?
"may i see a menu, please?"
"as soon as the bell rang, the teacher came into the classroom."
it began to snow.
"you're working part-time, aren't you?"
i'm not mad at you.
i called tom.
i like watching movies.
what's your friend's name?
are you all right?
you can't build buildings on swampy land.
the baby doesn't walk yet.
is it just me or does he look a bit like obama?
please tell tom that i'm going to be a few minutes late.
i want to live in a warmer place.
either day is ok.
we all couldn't believe it.
i like pie.
i've not seen him in a long time.
we can do it.
don't you think i can win?
"if you want to ask a question, please raise your hand."
studying when you're sleepy is a waste of time.
i like your voice.
mary is beautiful.
i need a corkscrew.
i understand your position perfectly.
you should study harder.
she's not talkative.
what are you doing right now?
i'll never tell you.
i thought tom was joking.
i'll go to school tomorrow.

"you understand, right?"
is this art?
peaches are fuzzy.

"you're the new secretary, aren't you?"
people living in a big city tend to lack exercise.
i can't believe you don't like ice cream.

he was exhausted when he got home.
"i'm so happy, i feel like i could fly."
i don't believe that ghosts exist.
i can touch the ceiling.
keep it up.
may i see you tomorrow?
i got furious.
the train leaves at six.

you haven't changed at all.
i want to be a doctor.
i've decided to postpone my trip to boston.

i received her letter the other day.
i don't know anything about his past.
i hope that your mother gets well soon.
i played tennis after i studied.

today's meeting has been canceled.
i'm in the attic.
why do people go to movies?
i want to eat popcorn.
were you in boston last summer?
can you manage to complete the manuscript by friday?

"if you haven't driven a bike yet, you should give it a shot."
i want to build an igloo.
you should make sure that you get there on time. tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
i'm happy as well.

i'd like seats on the first floor.
could you explain it more simply?
they aren't my real parents.
there was no one about.
i will not do it again.
i usually wear jeans.
i want to sleep in my own bed.
that's more recent than you think it is.

i saw a woman in black.
i get paid every month.
let's leave as soon as he gets back.
everyone in my family gets up early.
please come back as soon as possible.
maybe you'd better not do that.
it's a great spot for swimming.
the nurse will tell you how to do it.
the tired boy is fast asleep.
don't talk about that in front of tom.
the post office is a few minutes' walk from here.
those animals were in danger of dying out.
"what do you want? ""i want a dog."""
this is a very important point.
i have to be careful.
i did that for you.
may i go outside?
the atm is out of order.

i've been feeling stressed lately.
i wish i could travel around the world.
i actually never knew that.
i work for an oil company.
let's take the subway.

we should celebrate together.
the archer killed the deer.
you should be more careful with your money.
i want to go to another country.
it looks like i've caught a cold.
he tied the twigs into bundles.
you have nothing to be ashamed of.
my uncle went to mexico in 1983 and never returned.
i was caught in a shower this afternoon.
the result of the election will be announced tomorrow.

ireland is in western europe.
tell me about your boyfriend.
don't touch that button!
this room is for rent.
tom got back yesterday.
we need to sell our house.
a bright idea came to me.
we'll accept your conditions.
go back to the lab.
i seem to have left my umbrella on the train.
the boy lay listening to the radio.
humans are the only animals capable of laughter.
he failed because he did not have money.
lock the door!
enter your password.
he looks as if he were ill.
how old is this temple?
are you telling me the truth?
i have a favor to ask.

"may i see your passport, please?"
do you want to go again?
tom likes antique furniture.
i kneeled down.
tom never wants to see mary again.
why didn't you read the magazine?
she fooled him.
tom was blackmailed by mary.
i didn't order this.
i was really nervous.
i'm extremely tired.
don't worry about it.
those books are always in great demand.
i read the new york times.
why is tom waiting outside?
my father and i sometimes go fishing together.
"in the winter it's cold, so we turn the stove on."
tom kicked the trash can.
he couldn't speak french well.
please give my regards to your father.
are you crazy?
that isn't my problem.
sorry to trouble you.
please answer the phone.
i decided to stay home.
i hardly ever walk to work.
i can't quite understand it.
the station is in the center of the city.
"recently, no matter how much i sleep, it never seems to be enough."
i had to take a cab.
tom just can't get along with mary.
i didn't do it for you.
tom is wearing thick glasses.
our plans for tomorrow depend on the weather.
there is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.

"hey, this pizza isn't bad. not bad at all."
everyone's saying it.
tom took off his tie and started unbuttoning his shirt.
i was lonely.
give that to him.
i wish i were still single.
the door is made of glass.

i'm just looking.
he ran away with the money.
i was thrown off guard.
tom and mary are both from australia.
i try not to bother anyone.

you may go home.
this is the first time i've heard that word.
do you have any tattoos?
mary broke in on our conversation.
i was invited by an old friend.
i must be away on urgent business.
she is as busy as a bee.
could you please turn on the radio?
i'm going to the park now.
tom is coming here now.

i met her three days ago.
don't you know cheese is made from milk?
i'm traveling by myself.
she could not keep back a smile.
the cat lay hidden in the bushes.
ask tom about it.
you have to pace yourself or you'll choke halfway through.
i don't think that it'll work.
this dictionary isn't any good.
this wine is cheap.

it's about time you got up.
it's time to put the plan in action.
why did you park so far away?

"i'm all thumbs, so i'm not very good at origami."
she is french.
"because his parents had died when he was young, his uncle brought him up."
are you comfortable in that chair?

cooking is fun.
tom isn't usually as busy as mary.
"ten to one, he will succeed."
i'm looking at my reflection in the lake.
tom called mary.
how did you know i was hungry?
i ate smoked salmon.
no one's living in the house next door.
"when he finished speaking, everyone was silent."
do you know the meaning of this word?
it will be dark soon.
i lost my ticket. what should i do?
tom likes his new car.
the clock is above the fireplace.

he arrived too early.
i don't think we can do it.
can you put the children to bed?
"i'll be back by 7:00, i promise."
i only got a short glimpse of the thief.
it's a very steep slope.
i'm feeling a little nervous right now.
john met mary on his way to school.
she asked me if i would be free next sunday.
sorry for being so inconsiderate.
i saw him recently.
see you!
i don't know if tom is dead or alive.

she was kind enough to make tea for us.
"let me think it over, and i'll let you know later."
it isn't mine.
i never ever want to see you again.
did you intend to kill tom?
what is going on?
would you be so kind as to repeat that?
i didn't have enough money to buy a present for tom.
he resembles his grandfather.
"this chair was cheap, but it's very comfortable."
put more salt in the soup.
this will do for the time being.
my father is healthy.
i thought we were supposed to have breakfast together.
"turn on the light, please."

where are your things?
few people came to the lecture.
watch this.
i got to know him when i was a student.
i think tom is lucky.
tom had no choice but to buy a new phone.
i was woken up by the sound of thunder this morning.
"tom was your boyfriend when you were in high school, wasn't he?"
the snow prevented me from going there.
what a wonderful idea!
these are two nice pictures.
i can't ride a motorcycle.
tom sat by the fireplace.
he is still angry.
you ought to do that right away.
something really nice happened to me today.
i had nothing to do with that accident.
is it humid now in boston?
i feel like singing in the rain.
"the room only had a bed, a table and a chair."
we ran after the cat.
what were you thinking just now?
tom was sitting at the next table.
is that tom singing?
did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?
i'd like to speak to you in private.
the old man suddenly started talking to me.

you have a gift for music.
i helped my brother move his desk.
do you have money for the taxi?
does this bus go to the train station?
i lived in this house as a child.
i calculated that it would cost 300 dollars.
i live in a country where the cost of a liter of gasoline is cheaper than the cost of a liter of water.
won't you take a chair?
a trip to hawaii costs around 200 dollars.
why don't you be quiet?
i forgot to charge my cellphone.

don't forget the ticket.
do you sometimes get headaches?
we made him cry.
i'm a high school math teacher.
i don't switch on the light in my studio at night.
he was absent from school because he was sick.
i don't know how to drive.
leave that to the experts.
is tom still mad?
mind your own business!
"by the way, where do you live?"
it was a nice story.
scattered clouds mean heavy rain.
tom arrived precisely on time.
please wait for me at the entrance of the building.
do you want to read this magazine?
tom will tell mary.
"the radius of the earth is about 6,000 kilometers."
it's very unlikely that the teacher will believe tom's excuse for not having his homework done on time.
would you like some dinner?
i thought we wouldn't see each other again today.
the brake didn't work.
i want to surprise tom.

is this store open on sundays?
i'm on good terms with my brother.
are you interested in japanese music?
she's at the hotel now.
he quit smoking.
i'll carry that luggage.
he is the image of his father.
today is thursday.
an elephant is an enormous animal.
it isn't so muggy today.
my family had many debts.
"if i'd known, i would've told you."
"i ran as fast as possible, but i was not in time for the last train."
tom believes in the existence of ghosts.
my dream is to lead a quiet life in the country.
tom has a ford.
eat more slowly.
let me carry that for you.
"today, i just want to stay home and do nothing."
you should give up smoking.

no one knew for certain how the accident happened.
maybe i'm happiest when i'm playing the guitar.

i had my computer repaired.
walking to work in this heat isn't a good idea.
i've been here before.

have you ever heard him sing?
you're to blame.
could you tell me how to get to the station?

i will pick you up around six.
mary isn't my type.
my father never looked down on the poor.
tom was really lucky.
tom asked me a question.
i don't know when my mother will come back.
he tipped his hat.
tom has a good head on his shoulders.
do you have an airplane ticket back home?
"tom and i pushed the car as hard as we could, but it wouldn't budge."
my dream is to make it as an actor in hollywood.
you don't look so well.
he was always drinking in those days.
this tree is about as tall as that one.
we kissed without saying a word.
let's change the topic.

i'll check my schedule.
why does it cost so much to do this?
blood is thicker than water.
we traveled on foot.
show me how to do it.
mary is tom's daughter who lives in boston.
a good idea came across my mind.
tom and i go to the same high school.
this book is boring.
"tom did it, didn't he?"
tom is a brain surgeon.
"excuse me, would you show me how to use the washing machine?"
you know why we're here.
i know that you're here.
tom is almost always correct.
i'd like to master english.
"a group of foreigners arrived in edo, in other words tokyo."
"excuse me, where's the elevator?"
let's read lesson 3.
we don't get along with each other.

i was born and raised in the country.
he is satisfied with the result.
the stars are bright.
let me cut the carrots.
"not knowing her telephone number, i couldn't call her."
which one should i use?

i bought two cotton shirts.
there was no bathroom.
i haven't met him even once.

the house is built of red bricks.
i slipped and fell down the stairs.

he stuck the broken pieces together.
the results were unbelievably good.
i couldn't make myself understood.
the balloon popped.
tom broke his word.
he weighs 270 pounds.

have you gotten everything ready for tomorrow?
that was really interesting.
how many coins did you find?
i forgot to turn off the tv before going to bed.
does tom go to church?
"unfortunately, the report is true."
i went through the room into the garden.
let's go out for some ramen.
i'm afraid i've run short of coffee.
i guess it depends on the weather.
my dream is to take a round-the-world trip.
it was hard as rock.
tom couldn't stop yawning.
french is my native tongue.
it's in the kitchen.
i'm really tense.
i'm extremely sorry.

it looks like it's going to rain in the afternoon.
your french is good.
"first, i'll read this."
the news of the accident was a great shock to me.
it's under the bed.
that's too bad.
i don't just watch tv.
i fell asleep with my clothes on.
is there something you want to say?
don't move!
he placed the book on the shelf.
tom disagreed.
i got up early in order to attend the meeting.
"when it comes to mathematics, he is second to none in his class."
they are very big apples.

it never occurred to me that my words would hurt her feelings.
the task assigned to him was to do marketing research.
is there anything you want to talk about?
do you have money?
would you please let go of my arm?
i need to change my tires.
don't give me any more trouble.
"when you're in trouble, you can count on me."
she doesn't seem to be able to catch on to what he is saying.
i'm not as poor as you think i am.
he used me as a guinea pig.
tom whispered something into mary's ear.

i was laughed at by him.
"you know what kind of person tom is, right?"
"anyhow, i'm relieved the test is over."
i don't regret it.
warn tom.
it was stupid of me to believe that!
i want to buy this dictionary.
"when will you be back? ""it all depends on the weather."""
dogs can see in the dark.
the reason tom got sick was because he overate.
you're to do as i tell you.
how long is he going to stay in japan?
i always eat lunch here.
"to tell you the truth, i'm bored."
don't say anything.
was tom at home yesterday?
tom fell from his horse.
typhoon no.9 is approaching shikoku.
tom left through the back door.
i relaxed at home last sunday.

i count on your help.
"she's your aunt, isn't she?"
tom isn't married.
money can't buy freedom.
do you really care what i think?
they all envied my new car.
tom turned the light on.
"if necessary, i'll come soon."
he gave up.
he will visit his uncle.
we are going to leave tomorrow.
it's not easy to find a job these days.
i wish i was better at cooking.
i gave up my seat to an old lady.
tell tom about what you did the other night.
i tried to open the door.
"tom isn't going with you, is he?"
tom is particular about what he eats.
it'd be better to die than live a life like that.
you're taller than me.
"all at once, i heard a shrill cry."
i'm trapped.
tom poured cold water over himself to wake himself up.
"tom is the same age as i am, isn't he?"
tom said he thought that mary would be absent.
you'd better not walk around in such a place.
i don't know what it is.
why don't you go home?
she is really into knitting.
we're having a three-day weekend this week.
i've finished cleaning my room.

you didn't need to bring your umbrella.
my friend is seriously injured.
i awoke to find it snowing.
what are you going to do with this money?
my father made a shelf for me.
what's the secret ingredient?
did you order something?

that tickles.
the excited audience ran into the concert hall.
let's eat sushi.
what did you come here for?
i'm looking forward to it.
put the book on the top shelf.
don't shout like that. i can hear you perfectly.
they lived happily ever after.
i have a bad pain here.
he came to see me.
i didn't buy anything at the duty-free shops.
he did not get up early.
is it getting cold outside?

take good care of yourself.
"if i had more money, i would move to a bigger house."
would you like something to drink?
tom is in london on business now.
turn the radio down a little.
my son is taller than me.
i'll be back soon.
do you understand what i'm saying?
i can't describe my feelings.
i saw tom get out of the taxi.
what's your favorite piece of music?
don't talk with your mouth full.
who's this guy?
he thinks of everything in terms of money.
he took out his passport.
i wish i could live in a house that nice.
there's little hope of tom getting well soon.
it isn't necessarily so.
is it still far from here?
i wonder how tom is doing.
the mayor addressed the general public.
you should obey your parents.
keep your chin up.
tom was in his pajamas.
i have seen that girl before.
close all the doors and windows.
he's now short of money.
she is always busy.
don't put the chair there.
it's the only one there is in the shop.
tom has started dating an older woman.
were you sleeping?
the waitress set a glass of juice in front of me.
tom was only wearing a towel.
i prefer going out to staying home.
i couldn't anticipate that would happen.
that singer is very popular with young people.
speak quietly.
he didn't come to the last meeting.
we'll meet at the station at 2:30.
he left immediately.
the earth is like a ball with a big magnet in it.
we checked in at the hotel at three.
your garden needs some attention.
he made a clean break with them.
"i was going out, when the telephone rang."
i like watching planes take off.
everyone laughed.
i think it's around here.
cut the cake with this knife.
he's well built.
tom wants to read a book.
do you have any part-time work?
it has been ten years since i left japan.
how did the interview go?

he has three children.
i found the book interesting.
they have to repair their car.
quit acting like a child.
"when i opened the door of the refrigerator, an apple fell out."
tom despises mary.
she is kind.
ask your question.
bring the laundry in.
i'm very thirsty.
don't pry into the affairs of others.
playing cards is fun.
i had a bad headache. that's why i went to bed early.
we lost sight of the ufo right away.
the roof leaks every time it rains.
i'm very sorry to hear it.
try once again.
how about adding a touch of pepper?
"when i woke up this morning, it was raining hard."
i didn't know tom had a sense of humor.
please help yourself to the cake.
keep the door open.
i still haven't decided who i'm voting for.
leave this house.
the car is acting up again.
the gap between them has narrowed.
don't panic.
i think tom is ok.
she said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
i could say nothing in my dad's presence.
i had my watch stolen.
"another bottle of wine, please."
tom often puts honey in his tea instead of sugar.
i can't drink any more.
is this the place where your mother works?
you're very patient.
i bought flowers because my grandmother is coming today for a visit.
she wore a sad expression.
"tom, i have something to tell you."
i would like to have my teeth straightened.
i have nothing in particular to say about this problem.
the sheets feel damp.
"tom, too, likes mary."
turn right at the light.
i am going to stay here for a couple of days.
french is difficult.
is that a cat or a dog?
my father and my brother work at that factory.
we all know where you live.
only one person survived the accident.
i put my finger to my lips.
take your hands out of your pockets.
"could you pass me the pepper, please?"
the truck dumped the sand on the ground.
your beard makes you look old.
i would also like to rent a car.
how did you meet?
have a good christmas.
i have a friend who is a pilot.
calm down.
tom usually speaks french.
the boys played cops and robbers.
we have a factory in boston.
what is in the box?
what is your name?
he ran five miles.
my father has just come home.
i'm pretty sure tom's bald.
can you sing this song?
old people are inclined to look back on the past.
have you ever ridden in a sports car?
you may as well stay where you are.
he countered their proposal with a surprising suggestion.
do you need the car?
you have come at an opportune time.
i inherited my father's property.
everybody knows that he lost his leg in the war.
tom was always different from other children.
he acquired russian quickly.
yesterday i was on my way home from work when i ran smack into my old girlfriend.
i don't feel like doing anything today.
"you're not leaving japan for good, are you?"
a bad cold has kept me from studying this week.
"mary. ""what?"" ""do you have a boyfriend?"" ""why do you ask?"""
forgive me for being late.
this chair is ugly.
this bird cannot fly.
tom worked in boston.
i have some money.
what i said was just a guess.
i want to work in a factory.
i'm not the kind of idiot who would climb a mountain in the winter without proper preparations.
i can see why tom likes mary.
did you receive the letter?
we have to clear up the problem first.
i advise you to give up drinking.

put down your pencils.
we are brother and sister.
an old man came along.
the stewardess can speak french after a fashion.
do you have the same thing in a different color?
i wish that i didn't have to tell you this.
five fire engines rushed to the scene of the fire.
is there anything that i can do to help you?
"tom, your mom's here."
let us know if you're available next week.
the waves swallowed up the boat.
she has two cats. one is white and the other one is black.
he hardly works.
are you pregnant?
tom wanted to visit america.
she died yesterday afternoon.
it's been three years since my father died.
tom is doing laundry.
it's a rather interesting project.
please come in.
"i'm right, aren't i?"
he's used to speaking in public.
tom is more than just a friend.
be sure not to eat too much.
did you burn yourself?
let's take a short cut.
the restrooms are on the left.
try it again.
i object to her going there alone.
you can't miss it.
he's a japanese boy.
i don't know anything about what happened.
the financial situation is getting worse week by week.
i was caught in a shower.
"you know you have to do that, right?"
tom worked hard to achieve his goals.
i want a boiled egg.
i have a lot of things to do today.
he gave in to the temptation.
your face is dirty.
we studied french at school.
many friends saw him off.
that's pretty good.
you always reserve the same room.
i want this one and that one.
whales are classified as mammals.
he is unsociable.
tom couldn't eat for three days.

"thanks for your help. ""it was nothing."""
i'm all right.
he will join us later.
he decided to submit his resignation.
tom replied that he was sorry.
are you under any stress?
open your mouth wide.
i didn't think it would cost this much.
the old lady has been rather feeble since her illness.
i am afraid of what the teacher will say.
what are you worrying about?
i'm sure tom will help us.
we're next.
look at the girl over there.
i cannot help laughing at her jokes.
he dropped his books on the floor.
the news of the accident was a great shock to me.
she tapped the box with her forefinger.
i don't need a lawyer.
i'm going to talk to tom when he comes home.
now let's go.
i grow tomatoes and onions in my garden.
is there any place special you want to go?
can i borrow $30?
it is certain that he is wrong.
he came home dead tired.
i've never thought about becoming a teacher.
the quiz was very easy.
"could you pass me the pepper, please?"
we'll go on a picnic if it's fine tomorrow.
the strike affected the nation's economy.
it'll soon be three o'clock.

i acted for our captain while he was in the hospital.
i think tom's father is a lawyer.
he's the most valuable player on our team.
please make yourself at home.
we walked around the pond.

she is shy and always remains in the background.
i swear that's true.

don't worry.
can you pick me up at the station?
feta cheese has a lot of salt.
i'm at my wit's end.
we had a kid just last year.
tom runs a food bank in boston.
sit wherever you like.
thank you for coming all the way to see me off.

you have to apologize at once when you have done wrong.
is there anywhere near here where i can park my car?
can you wake me up at seven o'clock tomorrow morning?

"if you are to do well in school, you must study hard."
what's the tallest mountain in europe?
i shouldn't have stayed up all night.
i don't want to go anywhere.

is there something you'd like to ask me?
garden tools make a nice gift.
it's rained a lot this year.

i think she's over 40 years old.
you should not give liquor to children.
tom has an important job.
please prepare for the trip.
tom escaped in a stolen car.
i have a blister on my foot.
it was a heartbreaking story.
everything is all right.
tom lost a lot of weight.
she came to see me.
he couldn't come because he was sick.
i think you should stop smoking.
is that what you mean?
"no matter what anyone says, i plan to go."
i want to play outside with my friends.
that's easy to understand.
i had four tests this week.
is there any reason not to go to the beach today?
this tea smells good.
"i suspected that he was telling a lie, but that didn't surprise me."
promise that you won't forget me.
what's your point?
i immediately decided to turn off the light and go to sleep.
i don't care what people think about me anymore.
he is a fine gentleman.
tom put the book on the table.
i really wonder how much the inheritance tax will amount to.
i'll stay if it rains.
she saw him at the station.
i always try to eat a healthy diet.
tom will probably be the one who comes.
there are many good restaurants near here.
"i got home, took my shoes off and went to bed."
he was paralyzed by fear.
who's tom?
i wish i'd brought an umbrella with me.

who said that i didn't like tom?
they're on good terms with their neighbors.
the cold winter will soon be over.
thank you very much for all you have done.
most swiss people can speak three or four languages.
i don't want to say that to my girlfriend.
i'm going to stay here for a couple of days.
"a passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him around."
i didn't quite make out what he said.
i left my mobile phone at home.
do as you like.
are you canadian?
we don't have enough coffee.
was that a squirrel?
tom always carries a gun.
millions of workers lost their jobs.
that's too bad.
my favorite drink is black tea.
i heard something interesting from a friend yesterday.
i'd like to call my parents.
were you able to solve the problem?
she and i have nothing in common.
i'm looking for a lipstick to go with this nail polish.
finally we arrived at the lake.
the children are making a snowman.
my mother speaks slowly.
i was about to go to bed when the phone rang.
it's not fair.
please have some cake.
that's an incredible story.
i made plans.
the dog pursued a rabbit into the forest.
it's a ten-minute walk to school.
the express train is an hour faster than the local.
i said stay back.
tom sent mary home.
it was a very enjoyable afternoon.
"when i don't have anything to say, i'm not embarrassed to be quiet."
where do you want to live?
the water was lukewarm.
i've only been to boston once.
tom decided to study french.
please come back next week.
he was accused of murder.
it has nothing to do with the subject we're discussing.
don't leave your stuff behind.
i think tom is a very kind man.
i'm really confused.
the serious job shortage is also affecting those illegal foreign workers.
can i ask you something?
tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
he renounced the ownership of the land.
my mother made me a sweater.
a child was run over here last night.

i'm getting better every day.
"during the depression in the 1930's, many wealthy people lost everything in the stock market crash."
"my monthly wage is 300,000 yen."
"she wore a long, loose coat."
don't ever say that again.
i wear white shirts on weekdays.
"if you're tired, just let me know."
he said he read this book in a day.

i have a twin.
this doll is a gift from my aunt.

something has fallen by your feet.
i always stay at this hotel.
there are only three girls in the class.
"hurry up, or you will be late."
"to make a long story short, i was fired."
he's above telling lies.
put the phone down.
i think tom is really a good guy.

i'll beat you up!
put on your mask.

we had no choice but to leave the matter to him.
tom seems to be very happy.
the peace talks begin this week.
you should begin with easier questions.

was yesterday a cold day?
i wish i'd brought my camera.
we're closed on weekends.
"i didn't want the baby to catch a cold, so i closed the window."
tom didn't drink the milk.
that's not wine. it's grape juice.

she told me today that she loved me.
i burned the roof of my mouth.
let's wait until tomorrow.

"tom wasn't wrong, was he?"
i'm really good at finding four-leaf clovers.
a calculator is more efficient than an abacus.

tom said that he'd never ever do that.
i'm no liar.
i plan to stay here until i run out of money.
shut the door.

"write your name and address, please."
what makes you so sad?

i'm glad to see you.
please water the flowers.
i'm studying hard for entrance exams.
all you have to do is sign this paper.
i haven't seen tom since october.
who are you waiting for?
i don't belong to the club.
it was courteous of him to write a letter of thanks.
"i don't think it will rain, but i'll take an umbrella in case it does."
that's all for tonight.
i just wanted to sleep.
do you have a table on the patio?
you can go home.
one for all and all for one.
get tom.
i never thought you'd do that.
tom said he'd get home by 2:30.
he is making cookies.
tom came straight home after school.
i will grant that you are right on this point.
maybe it's time to change my hair and do a makeover.

do you like rain?
the sky became as dark as if the sun had sunk.
i slowly opened my eyes.
it's the first time that anybody said something like that to me.
the font is too large.
you can't tell tom what really happened.
"speak french, ok?"
is that your sister?

i want to drink something cold.
i'm one of tom's ex-wives.
this is the first time that i've heard that word.
i have 30 students in my class.
i've been writing letters all morning.
can you come to tonight's meeting?
i asked you if you wanted some help.
we appreciate your hard work.
i'm not busy.
"yes, i like it very much."
have a look at that picture.
ask tom.
this food is very nutritious.
he has a lot of things to do.

why not try boxing?
it took me five hours to drive there.
i'm not a fan of action movies.

i learned a lot.
thanks for your reply.
i'm glad i could help you.
"what's the word for ""kaisha"" in english?"
it seems that those two are made for each other.
don't feel bad. tom didn't give me a present either.
do you want to become a father?
i had intended to visit you yesterday.
tom was lying in bed watching tv.
please don't forget to put out the fire before you go home.
it wasn't until yesterday that i found out the truth.
i have no intention of asking him.
is the food ready?
i'm going to leave one day early.
would you like to go abroad?
i'd like to make a reservation for tonight.
do you have any allergies?
mind your manners.
my father wants me to study abroad while i'm young.
we went shopping for clothes.
she was burning to tell the secret.
i feel like i've heard that somewhere before.
i'll call you tonight.
tom couldn't help but agree.
you're bad.
she is responsible for this broken window.
are you on your way to the station?
i got a video cassette recorder cheap at that shop.
the white ball weighs as much as the red ball.
you should head home.
you should've told me yesterday.
have you ever considered quitting your job to raise your children?
i turned my steering wheel to the right.
don't flatter yourself.
"bill, please."
that's my house.
she let the secret out.
are you going to eat those cupcakes?
she will have her own way.
she smiled at me.
please restart your computer.
i thought about giving my saxophone to tom as a gift.
i'd think twice about this.
i have nothing to do today.
would you like some more salt on your popcorn?
i think tom is still hungry.
the shirt is still damp.
i went to the hospital.
have you ever heard this opera sung in italian?
tom always keeps his room clean.
don't worry about such a trivial problem.
tom winked.
coffee is brazil's main product.
he's apt to forget his promise.
what are you going to tell tom?
you're still too young to get a driver's license.
tom likes to show off in front of girls.
wait. the phone's ringing.
"when mary was a child, her family was very poor."
i wish i could've been a kid forever.
"when i was younger, i hated going to weddings. my grandmothers and aunts would huddle around me, poke me in the side, and giggle ""you're next! you're next!"" they only stopped this nonsense when i began to do the same thing at funerals."
i competed with him for the first prize.
he made a sharp turn to the right.
wisdom is better than gold or silver.
do you want to come along?
tom is coming to the party as well.
it's ok not to eat it.
he is inclined to get mad.
the first one wasn't the best.
i was asked to deliver this.
he's staying at a hotel.
tom hasn't regained consciousness yet.
open your book to page 30.
do these gloves fit you?
is it too early to call tom?
why can't tom come?
don't leave things half done.
i wasn't able to understand anything.
i was encouraged by his words.
are you planning on getting tom something for christmas?
tom went to the music festival.
please stick this notice to the door.
i was ashamed of my behavior.
it's not good for you.
whose car is this?
the baby in the cradle is very cute.
i wish that i didn't have to go to work today.
he passed away yesterday.
are you dead?
i'll take a nap after lunch.
do you like the piano?
summer is the season i like best.
it was very hot inside the bus.
where are you going so early?
a fish leaped out of the water.
tom wondered how many times mary was going to run around the track.
we've had more snow this winter than usual.
have you finished knitting that sweater?
there's someone waiting for us outside.
you're my only friend.
tom has very good handwriting.
"i need some paper, pencils, ink and so on."
you'd better eat breakfast.
tom didn't want to stay home alone.
have you read today's paper?
may i eat in my room?
i read my horoscope today.
my attitude towards him changed.
when did mary buy this skirt?
do you want me to help you look for your keys?
this knife cuts well.
you are a teacher.
i like him.
wait a bit more.
i want you to see her.
the party was such a great success.
where can i buy tickets?
nowadays children don't play outdoors.
tom quickly opened the drawer and pulled out a gun.
i did so for the sake of my health.
there was only one small problem.
i have a favor to ask.
tom has to get up early.
that will do.
we shared the cost of the meal.
let's start.
"i saw a wolf, a fox, and a rabbit."
those present at the meeting supported the bill.
he saw her and blushed.
he was acquainted with everybody in town.
"to me, skiing is far more interesting than skating."
are you with tom?
are you saying you don't like this?
i don't believe the child came to tokyo alone.
it was lucky for you that you found it.
i'm sorry i didn't call last night.
my friends scolded me for my stupid behavior.
is it all right to eat out tonight?
you should rewrite this sentence.
"at this hour, there is incredible traffic."
dinner's ready!
my name isn't on the list.
what's the bus fare?
the baby was fast asleep.
where's the post office?
dinner is ready.
she wants to be a designer.
that is his car.
let's call tom.
i caught a big fish yesterday.
there was hardly anyone in the room.
i asked him where he lived.
i almost missed the train.
i'll gladly help you.
i apologized immediately.
tom isn't interested in horses.
every person is unique.
you'll catch the bus if you hurry.
i'm amazed at your audacity.
what did you do that for?
"the company, although with some exceptions, usually utilizes its resources very well."
i don't think i'll succeed.
i haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
how would you like to pay for it?
i'll go find tom.
we dislike violence.
tom isn't a fussy eater.
i fell asleep while listening to the radio.
i forgot to put on my seatbelt.
i think it'd be good if you read this book.
tom didn't seem interested.
"if you eat your vegetables, you can have ice cream for dessert."
tom went to boston.
that's cheap.
i don't feel like doing my math homework now.
i hit the mark with the arrow.
she didn't give me back my money.
can i have everyone's attention please?
i'm poor at tennis.
stay away from us.
hurry up or you'll be late.
he lost all of his money.
i'm good at japanese.
tom said mary was really drunk.
don't just stand there. come on in.
let's go to the river.
i live next door to the toy shop.
come whenever you want to.
my grandfather was a pharmacist.
i like this pizza.
my girlfriend is older than i am.
don't worry about the results.
the sea was calm.
he served a ten-year prison term.
we live in the suburbs.
just a minute.
we've had more snow than usual this winter.
the mouse ran and the cat ran after him.
that's a very good thing.
please behave prudently.
"if we were to live on the moon, how large would the earth look?"
tom's the same age as mary.
"at last, the bus stopped."
i don't like ironing.
i'm not in favor of such a plan.
where is the closest travel agency?
tom hasn't called mary yet.
i'm still very busy.
"today, i went shopping twice."
i took off my hat and entered the church.
just wait for me there.
it would be better to stay at home than go out.
this is what i found in the cave.
when is your next train for boston?
"now that you mention it, i haven't seen tom recently."
a stranger spoke to me on the bus.
"it's happened again, hasn't it?"
what is the next class?
do you want a hot dog?
the children looked interested.
"tom isn't mad at us, is he?"
don't tell anyone yet.
tom got attacked by a swarm of bees.
do you like coffee?
leave it to me.
pick a date.
"tom is romantic, isn't he?"
tom enjoys himself at everything he does.
why are you talking to yourself?
tom bowed.
her name is known all over the world.
don't go near the dog.
i'll have this radio fixed tomorrow.
the king abused his power.
it's ok to cry when you need to.
i couldn't speak french.
try on another one.
"according to the news, there will be a typhoon tomorrow."
i hate people who do that kind of thing.
there are rumors that he will resign.
everyone in the room looked bored.
"i'm glad to meet you, too."
never say never.
"thank you for helping me. ""don't mention it."""
my sister is always weighing herself.
don't put yourself in danger.
don't listen to her.
he dozed off.
this vending machine takes only hundred-yen coins.
he acted on the stage.
this is my fiancé.
he was heartbroken.
can i watch television now?
i used to swim here every day.
the water was warm.
this book hasn't yet been translated into french.
i don't belong to anyone.
what's the definition of jazz?
today is a special day.
"she's not young, is she?"
tom didn't tell me why he was late.
tom let me down.
the bridge is thirty meters in width.
we have absolutely nothing in common.
he drank a shot of whiskey.
we hung up the laundry.
they accused him of stealing the bicycle.
do you have a motorcycle?
there's a sauna and a pool.
it's about three hundred miles from here to boston.
the rope was a couple of meters too short.
"i didn't know the way, so i looked at the map."
tom ate a carrot.
i'll be back in a wink.
who's your favorite character in this book?
i was aching for a cigarette.
all the students were present.
you should have your head examined.
isn't it good?
could you please open the window?
this is a waste of time and money.
all of them went there.
he may be sick in bed.
they struggled against the dictator.
i thought i had it all.
that's not a disease.
i like blue more than red.
do you know tom's girlfriend's name?
"by the way, what's your address?"
when's election day?
that work is mostly done.
let's move the sofa.
where is the japan airlines counter?
i did nothing illegal.
no way!
where is the train station?
i'll punch your lights out!
tom is in the garden now.
she's used to staying up late.
i don't mind waiting for a while.
"you want to do that, don't you?"
is there something in particular that you want to see?
tom pointed to the picture on the wall.
he is running now.
elephants are in danger of dying out.
tom got back from australia yesterday.
a monkey ran out in front of our bus.
i'm tied up now. could you make it later?
do you have an opinion?
i can't figure out why he said so.
"it's only a short way, so you can walk there in a few minutes."
we've really hit it off.
there's something in my eye.
call the police!
the smoke alarm has never been maintained.
i'm looking forward to going to the concert.
tom bought a very cheap camera.
this line shows the longitude.
i prepared for the game by training hard.
we're calling the police.
it's a bit warmer today than usual.
i came early to get a good seat.
i never realized tom was so stupid.
you'll hurt yourself if you aren't careful.
"last year, i traveled overseas with some friends."
i got the money back from him.
broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables.
could you tell me the way to the station?
tom has to go to school today.
you can only die once.
i have a friend whose father is a magician.
"recently, the weather has been bad."
maybe he won't become famous.
i thought tom was asleep.
tom is pulling mary's hair.
tom got into his car.
will you give me a ride to my hotel?
i can't remember the meaning of the word that i looked up yesterday.
i got stuck in a traffic jam on the expressway.
i've been sick in bed since last monday.
i heard something in the bedroom.
did you turn off the gas?
tom took the sheets off the bed and put them in the washing machine.
"last night, i went to see a movie."
tom and mary played hockey.
this tastes a lot better than what tom usually cooks.
do you have any small change?
you can sleep late tomorrow morning.
how many ex-wives do you have?
what is considered impolite in one language may not be considered impolite in another language.
we definitely can't win.
i wish i had a room of my own.
bring it to me.
let me know if i'm wrong.
man is the only animal that uses fire.
a screen divided the room into two.
bacteria are invisible to the naked eye.
it isn't a serious mistake.
please pass me the salt.
he has a good head on his shoulders.
do you think that my work is easy?
can i help in any way?
there are about thirty people in this room.
sit down and take it easy for a while.
tom immediately called 911.
the first thing we do when we get up is eat breakfast.
i've made the same mistakes as i made last time.
don't stand in front of me.
what's your specialty?
have a nice flight.
there's nothing left in the fridge.
i'm pooped.
both tom and mary agreed with john.
we hear with our ears.
i'm tired of tom.
don't run so fast.
he went to stay with his cousin.
let me introduce you to my parents.
thank you for coming.
i don't eat as much as you.
tom wasn't the one who did that.
tom is making dinner for me.
i've read every book in the library.
my grandfather can't hear very well.
please give me a hint.
is there an atm around here?
how is your sister?
my name isn't on the list.
he took no notice of our warning.
i will be back soon.
i think we'd better wait another thirty minutes.
please take your hat off.
tom solved the problem by himself.
neither you nor i are mistaken.
where's the restroom?
i'll do my homework.
tom has moved to boston.
i'm still a beginner at french.
i've always wanted to try that.
i wonder how tom got away.
my husband is a very good cook.
tom repaired the broken radio.
i have a lot of things to do today.
this dog barks a lot.
"at ten past eight this morning, mary gave birth to healthy triplets."
he has guts.
"although tom lives nearby, i rarely see him."
please fasten your seat belt.
there's almost no coffee left in the pot.
tom sliced the apple.
did you finish the job?
don't worry. i'll remember.
what's this supposed to mean?
is that coffee?
it's raining hard tonight.
how are things at school?
where has tom gone?
someday we'll know the truth.
i like this place.
tom doesn't seem to have noticed.
"suddenly, it started to rain."
i thought that that went well.
do you know whose this is?
have you ever shaved your legs?
have you heard from tom?
this is the worst movie i've ever seen.
could you do me a favor?
tom forgot.
they didn't swim because it was cold.
she lives alone.
i bought her a new car.
i know that tom is from australia.
i only meant it as a joke.
i never knew his name.
were you happy at that time?
"you're still mad, aren't you?"
cars today are amazing.
all these books are mine.
tom rushed to his room.
i don't know what i was thinking.
i never see this picture without thinking of my father.
"if your parents heard of your success, they would be proud of you."
they stopped talking.
sit on the sofa and make yourself comfortable.
i want a bottle of coca-cola.
it's easy to explain.
tom often climbs trees.
he failed in spite of his great efforts.
"to tell the truth, i've lost your pen."
there is a glass there.
are you sure you're ready?
who do you think he is?
i didn't notice that my wallet was gone until i got home.
that's absurd.
are you insane?
what kind of camera do you have?
i lived overseas for ten years.
