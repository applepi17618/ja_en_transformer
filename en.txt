"Tom, you wrote this part wrong."
These grapes are ripe.
Tom was found guilty.
Have I changed that much?
He lives in a poor district of London.
I wonder whether a person can live on only two hours of sleep a night.
Do you feel any better today?
Happy events tend to be accompanied by problems.
You have to study more.
We have an opening at two o'clock.
Tom can't tie his own tie.
There's a monster under the bed.
This is a company car.
I'm busy at the moment.
Tom ought to win.
You probably just have a cold.
You have to read between the lines.
Don't worry.
She spent many days knitting a sweater for him.
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree.
That'll be something to see.

Speak clearly.
I finished reading the book last night.
I think Tom and Mary are probably younger than you think they are.

I want to go swimming.
All of them are Canadian.
Tom will look at it.
I explained the rules to her.
It was a very simple trick.
I'm using the computer.
I went to bed a little later than usual.
I moved last month.
I hope that your parents will allow us to get married.
Stop talking about work.

What is that?
It's a long way to town.
I'm busy with my homework.
You can't be in two places at the same time.
I got on the wrong bus.
I can't stay for long.
Give me something to write with.
Our dog seldom bites.

I have no idea what to do.
Can I eat this?
Tom is taking online classes.
My cell phone rang.
Show me how to do it.
All the girls in my class are kind.
I thought that Tom was mistaken.
We want to buy a house in Boston.
They agree that they have no choice but to give up the whole plan.
Somebody laughed.
Tom won't talk.
Tom held Mary tight.
Are you doing this on purpose?
Tom didn't know that Mary was in the hospital.
Tom has no friends to play with.
Sometimes I hate myself.

I forgot to turn off the lights when I left.
Awesome!
Take that box away!
Let's visit some temples tomorrow.
Call me once you've arrived.

Only a handful of people came to the meeting.
Tom and I've been dating for three months now.
It was Tom who hit me.
"When she was thirteen, she ran away from home."
How do I open this door?
"If you eat this, then I'll eat it, too."
She must have been very young when she wrote this poem.
Tom wanted to send a message.
I want to know more about your school life.
My throat is a little sore.
I think French is hard.
Great! Let's get together sometime.
"I can't speak French, but I can understand it."
I didn't see Tom last night.
The sunshine improved his complexion.
Her party was really fun.
I make 100 euros a day.
Tom is rather busy at the moment.
I have a sore throat and runny nose.
You must keep your room clean.
I thought that you were right.
Five miles is a long distance to walk.
I'll be here all day tomorrow.
Turn on the light. I can't see anything.
This kind of work requires a lot of patience.
This work is enough to break my back.
I guess Tom was right.
She went to a movie the other day.
I don't know what the question means.
Nice to meet you.
How is your cold?
What's happening?

Let's just grab a quick bite to eat and then get back to work.
Mountain bike racing has caught on with young Japanese in the past few years.
Would you please turn on the TV?
The police suspect Tom is a serial killer.

Why didn't you reply to my email?
Do you know how to fold a paper airplane?

What kinds of beer do you have?
The artist whose paintings you liked is a friend of mine.
There are at least 500 students here.
She acted as a guide.
Tom is also coming to the party.
I have other things to do.
It doesn't matter whether he comes or not.
Come home before dark.

Would you mind if I turned the TV on?
I hate spiders.
Are banks open on Monday?
Tell me about your project.
He did not mention it.
Tom had a hasty breakfast.
I haven't been to work. I've stayed at home all day.
We had a little trouble with the equipment yesterday.
Raise your hands.
I think Tom doesn't like talking about himself.
I have something that I want to say to him.
They went to the beach.
"I'm not accustomed to working day and night. ""You'll soon get used to it."""

He sat looking out of the window.
Bring me a bottle of beer.
Where are you planning to go?
Everybody thinks so.
She and I usually have the same opinion.
I was very surprised when Tom told me that Mary had left Boston.

He likes fishing.
I did that three days ago.
It's perfectly white.

Please come to see me from time to time.
Tom looked into my eyes.
It's hot today so I can swim in the sea.
Tom almost got run over.
Please turn in the report by the end of the month.
"My leg's gone to sleep, so whatever you do, don't touch my leg now."
I think that Tom may come to Boston for Thanksgiving.
We received some new information.
Which boy did that?
You've drunk too much.
"You know something, right?"
Both of you are right.
It's your turn next.
He has a good command of English.
Tom asked his father if he could go to the movies.
"I'm sorry, but I'm against this project."
"The thing is, I really like this picture."
Are you in trouble?
"You're lying, aren't you?"
I used to stay up late at night.
"Anyway, I did my best."
I don't know if I'll have time tomorrow.
My husband is a good man.

Tell me what happened.
Prices are rising.
Pay your rent in advance.
I thought you were broke.
"It wasn't that Tom didn't want to go to school, he couldn't go to school because he wasn't feeling well."
We listened to her for some time.
I believe in ghosts.
He was just in time for the last train.

It is one thing to make a plan and quite another to carry it out.
I asked Tom what that is.
Where did you learn such a difficult word?
Some dogs are very smart.
Do you know how to drive?
I don't have it.
"Well, I think Tom's right."
The key was under the sofa.
You've got to be careful or else you'll miss it again.
We waited three hours.
Please introduce me to a cute girl.
I had a good dream.
Tom had no appetite because of his illness.
Are you thinking about me?
Show me another bag.
I have to do something with this eggplant.
Humans have two ears.
Is there a cash machine around here?

This rule applies to all cases.
She's an admirable woman.
I ate fried rice for lunch today.
Is this your first visit here?
Next month is Tom's birthday.
We went to the library together.
Keep up your courage.
Tom replied that he was sorry.
He used to read a lot.
The traffic light was green.
He went out in spite of the storm.
"Good morning, said Tom with a smile on his face."
You must get rid of such a habit.
Tom is not looking happy.
I feel very feverish.
I will pick you up around six.
I'm tired today.
What's the point in doing that?
This is the original.
It would be counter-productive to do such a thing.

It will stop raining soon.
I'm a coward.
A thousand meters is one kilometer.
Did you catch the train?!
I like this house as it is.

Can I pay by credit card?
A trip by boat takes more time than one by car.
"Two small bottles, please."
I'd rather live in a wooden house.
Tom wanted to be a fireman.
I've never been this sick before.
I can't take it any more.
Do you remember that girl I told you about?
It was getting closer and closer.
"I'd like to buy a house, but I can't afford to."
Could I have the check?
I put on a cap when I go to school.
Long time no see.
We could see the ship in the distance.
This road goes to the park.

You'll have to come tomorrow.
Take whichever you like best.
Go on home.
I'm curious.
I'm afraid Tom might not like this.

Close the book.
I'm in the library.
Do you still love him?
We tied him up so that he wouldn't be able to escape.

Tom said he saw the invisible man today.
I wasn't able to understand that explanation.
Are you having fun?
Oil is extracted from olives.
Tom is on a road trip.
I can't find my bag.
I love this video.
They carried on with the plan in spite of strong objections to it.
There are some things that you should never try doing.

Please buy me this book.

Did Tom study French yesterday?
The plane turned sharply to the right just before it crashed.
I skipped out on my appointment with my boss.
"When it's morning in California, it's late at night in Japan."
The meeting was adjourned until the next week.
This is about all I can put up with.
Tom has a tree in his backyard.
I rarely catch a cold.
I don't mean to poke my nose into your affairs.
What are you doing?
Do we have enough glasses?
I found the glass empty.
Where do you go to high school?
It could happen to anyone.
Tom has betrayed me.
The weather is perfect today.

I think you'll be a good dad.
The child boarded the plane in a good mood.
It's not just a pen.

"Since I didn't eat anything for breakfast, I'm very hungry now."
How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
Is there anything you need to do today?
I helped Tom carry his desk.
I need it right away.
I have a daughter who's married to a Frenchman.
It's a bit cold today.
Will you be quiet?
I borrowed this book from him.
I wanted to return to your village.
Is this fish still alive?
"Hello, I never thought I'd meet you in a place like this."
I don't know what to do anymore.
A gentleman wouldn't do such a thing.
What's up?
"Unfortunately, the information is accurate."
Please try drinking that coffee. I think it tastes very good.
I gave him the book.
"I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now."
My pet cat died yesterday.
Make sure to turn off all the lights before going out.
The picture reminds me of my school days.
I can't live without Tom.
He disappeared in the crowd.
Were you drinking?
He was leaning against the wall.
This milk has a peculiar taste.
Are you saying I'm a liar?
It cannot be true.

He ran away as soon as possible.

Have you been away?
You're imagining things.
I have fifteen hundred cows.
I am terribly hungry.
The caller hung up.
"Look after the place while we're out, OK?"
You can use this computer any time.
Am I the only one that doesn't agree with you?
I wonder if Tom is able to understand French.
He is very honest.
My father passed away when he was 54.
Thank you for all you did for me that time.
Please make yourself comfortable.

I'm still in high school.
This is the fire exit.
Your door is still partially open.
Do you really think that Tom is from Australia?

We're studying French and web design.
I'm really looking forward to seeing you.
"Since it was Sunday, the store was closed."
Tom and Mary spoke on the phone.
How long can you wait?

I'm going to make you cry.
Who killed Tom?
He is uncertain about his future.
Tom regrets telling Mary his telephone number.
He's a fine young man.

He was just on the verge of going to sleep.
Why should I help Tom?
I'm busy all the time.

Choose between these two.
The poor little girl did nothing but sob all day.
Tom is staying at the hotel near my house.
I haven't yet had time to see about a hotel for the night.
It's five minutes to nine.
I thought we were going to go somewhere.
That's not what I intended to say.
I wanted an older brother.
"She likes jazz, and so do I."
I can't believe Tom.
The dog next door kept barking all night.
Is it OK if I touch this?
I've got three computers.
Count me in.
Don't go near the fire.
It went just as we expected.
My wife is preparing dinner right now.

Are you in favor of the new law?
You don't understand.
"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious. ""I have no idea."""

I ache all over.
The accident happened on Sunday at about 3:00.
"I'm tired, but I still have a lot of work I need to do."
"You came by car, didn't you?"
I have a lot of money and enough time to use it.
You're going too far.
Let me handle this.
What has Tom done today?
Tom was afraid that he might be expelled from school.
My university has a dorm.
Are you getting hungry?
My attitude towards him changed.
He fell in love with her at first sight.
We happened to take the same train.
Tom wants his daughter to get married.
I'm still waiting for my order.
My briefcase is full of papers.
We learn by experience.
What's that thing?
I acted on his advice.
Many accidents happen every year.
Mary looked at herself in the mirror.
Do you have a tatami room for ten people?

He went to the store.
I wash my hair every day.
What do you have in your pocket?
It is said that he is the richest man in the world.
My car is now being repaired.
Mary's husband is one of my friends.
I looked up at the sky.
It took me three hours to finish doing that.
Everybody knows two and two make four.
It is already too late.
He shoved the letter into his pocket.
Why don't you sit down and relax?
Please drop by my home.
It looked so delicious.
What is 6 subtracted from 10?
Do you have anything I can eat right away?
Tom likes reggae.
I'm so sorry.
"I agree with him. ""So do I."""
We began our work at noon.
Has Tom ever tried that?
She went out to buy some food.
I can see a strange blue bird on the roof.
I'll do it for you.
The animals were scared by the thunder.
She assisted her brother with his homework.
She's not here for the purpose of defending herself against these accusations.
Every even number is the sum of two primes.
It's just a cold.
Why does the US government let people have guns?
I think Tom is allergic to cats.
The importance of this matter cannot be over-emphasized.
I'm very busy these days.
Are you all set for the trip?
I can speak English.
Please come over with your wife.
You need to attach your photo to the application form.
Christmas is just two weeks from now.
I'm Tom's coach.
That's a nice T-shirt.
Stop tickling me.
I sleep six hours a day on average.
Thank you for your time.
The picnic was held in the gym on account of the rain.
How did you meet that girl?
Are you two planning to get married?
All the passengers got seasick during the storm.
Shut your big mouth.
It's about to rain.
I'll see him again.

Why is Tom doing that?
Tom insisted.
I'm a boy.
There's a spring in the center of the village.
You will be disliked by girls if you play practical jokes on them.

Tom was brought up in Boston.
I want to eat fried rice.
Watch out for pickpockets.
I want to become a politician.
I want to become a ballet dancer.
I don't like your going out alone.
I like children. That's why I became a teacher.
I'm not a child anymore.
Thanks for encouraging me.
I got up at about five.
You should take her advice.
What'll you have to drink?
Do you think we have a chance?
Tom's house is over there.
Tom learned sign language.
Tom got hurt playing soccer.
I'll talk to Tom when he gets home.
Tom is a doctor in Australia.
Are you planning on doing that?
I can't thank you enough.
I have a small request for you.
I'll help you as much as I can.
The room was devoid of furniture.
How was your trip?
I didn't know what to say.
Your stitches will need to be removed in a few days.
The weather is nice today.
I already did that.
That was the first time that I'd ever seen Tom get angry.
I really hate that.
I liked studying French in high school.
Living abroad is the best way to learn a foreign language.
You've already told me this story.
Her late husband was a violinist.
They often drop in at my house.
School begins at 8:10 a.m.
Tom is behind in his studies.
Tom doesn't eat as much as Mary does.
"Last Sunday, Mary and I went to the library together."
The train arrived ten minutes behind time.
It's my dream to win a Nobel Prize.
This soup needs more salt.
Is that my coffee?
We have been waiting for Tom for many years.
Check your pockets.
Tom can't believe what he's just seen.
Please subscribe to my channel.
We enjoyed our trip to Europe.
We almost got there on time.
Tom kissed Mary on her forehead.
Where are you going to put this?
The house with the green roof is mine.
What type of music do you like?
Is this love?
I want to go abroad.
It's a win-win situation.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
May I kiss your wife?
They stayed up late talking.
That was just a warning shot.
This isn't in French.
Are you interested in music?
I was able to swim across the river.
Tom is a regular blood donor.
What is love?
I tried not to laugh.
I can't stop the bleeding.
I drank too much.
He cut down a tree in the garden.
Where is the elevator?
"He said, ""I plan to become a researcher."""
This is the store where I worked.
"Yesterday, I got a call out of the blue from Tom."
"To tell the truth, we got married last year."
I'll be back at six.
"Tom is in the kitchen, washing dishes."
I was going to come alone.
The tickets sold like hot cakes.
I think it's dangerous to climb a mountain on a day when it's stormy.
"Do you have a pen? ""Yes, I have one."""
When can I visit you?
Tom's useless.
The train was about to leave.
Horseradish tastes good on roast beef sandwiches.
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
I'll be back in 30 minutes.
It must be hard for you.
Why don't you go home early today?
Did you know that Tom doesn't have a driver's license?
Don't stand in other people's way.
Tom was desperate to defend his reputation.
That's a fake.
Let's put this money aside for our summer trip.
Are you here on your own?
Tom drove the car.
"When I grow up, I want to be an English teacher."
I hope this isn't a dream.
The weather was very nice today.
I need to rinse my mouth.
"Actually, that's what I thought."
A selfish man thinks of nothing but his own feelings.
"Tom had plenty of chances to apologize, but he didn't."
She came in quietly so she wouldn't wake up the baby.
Would you care for a drink?
I'd do it again if I had the chance.
He doesn't earn enough money to live on.
I studied English for four years with a native speaker.
How long have you been retired?
I'm eating.
You should know it.
What we need now is something hot to drink.
I was with friends.
"In September, there are just a few people here and there on the beach."
I like to ride horses.
I arrived too early.
I don't have a sister.
I feel like I'm dreaming.
I didn't want to surprise you.
Is it safe to eat moldy bread?
The boys are playing football.
A good appetite is a good sauce.
It might not be that easy.
It's been a while since we last met.
He glanced over the newspaper before turning in.
Don't step in the flower bed.
I wish that Tom hadn't told Mary that I'd been in prison.
They finished their meal.
I brought flowers.
You'll be paid according to the amount of work you do.
Tom caught an intruder in his house.
I said that as a joke.
I wanted a jacket.
Tom said he doesn't know Mary.
How long have you lived here?
Tom is the kind of guy you just can't hate.
Are you hungry now?
Tom works out in a gym near his house.
Do you have a bike?
He didn't stop the car.
Why do you think that it was Tom who did that?
Tom is truly a free spirit.
"Excuse me, but may I put my books here?"
About how long will it take?
Don't slam the door.
TV's boring today.
These shoes belong to me.
Zip your lips.
Try it again.
Don't worry about the results of your test.
My dream is to take a round-the-world trip.
Tom and Mary said that they'd rather do it alone.
When will you leave?
How much does this camera cost?
I cannot speak German.
I want it.
Tom seems clever.
Are you a doctor?
I got some shampoo in my eyes and it burns.
My father's hair has become white.
Are you still hungry?
He lives in England.
"To make matters worse, it began to rain."
What do you have?
I hate the smell of garlic.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
I want this suit cleaned.
Tom got paint on his shirt while he was painting the fence.
Roll the dice.
This bomb can kill many people.
We'll contact you.
I promise to come back early.
Fish like carp and trout live in fresh water.
"That's everything, right?"
I read this book when I was in high school.
What's the pizza place's phone number?
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
Help me get this luggage into the truck.
"I don't know if you've noticed, but Tom seems to have fallen in love with your daughter."
Tom has a lot of patience.
He had decided on a new policy.
It's very warm today.
English and German are related languages.
I made this food myself.
Tom is working hard to improve his English.
Turn up the volume.
You people are insane.
Do you need gloves?
Please put your cigarette out.
"Unfortunately, I hardly speak any French."
I can hear something.
I just made it under the wire.
Tom often skips meetings.
The song was a big hit.
Is that weird?
Christmas is just two weeks away.
The flowers wilted.
Open your hands.
What's the tallest mountain in Europe?
You should cultivate the habit of getting up early.
He has made rapid progress in English.
There aren't many tall buildings in this area.
Where are you going to eat lunch?
He entered the college to study electronics.
The earth is about six times as large as the moon.
What did you lose?
I am not always free on Sundays.
One hundred and fifty people entered the marathon race.
When was the last time we met?
Are you the new teacher?
Please call an ambulance.
Tom seems a bit depressed this morning.
She sings well.
Never be afraid to make mistakes.
He hurt his left hand.
Can anybody here speak French?
Tom is still uncertain about whether to go to college or not.
Pink is for girls.
"Excuse me, could you please close the door?"
"When I woke up, I was in the car."
Did you win the trophy?
I'm always the one the boss turns to.
We don't talk much.
Do you prefer to go by train or bus?
He earns over 500 dollars a month at that job.
Tom is in a book club.
The reason why you failed is you didn't try hard enough.
I'm not good with kids.
We were made to stand in line.
I found a good place.
"I think Tom, without question, is going to win."
Did you sleep with the windows open?
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
He married a stewardess.
I played video games after I finished my homework.
Say something.
How far is it to the airport?
Tom expects too much of Mary.
I'm very happy to know you.
My aunt gave me a book for Christmas.
I gave him a gold watch.
When is your birthday?
I can't put up with him any longer.
"No more, thank you. I'm full."
I don't know how much this motorcycle is.
The taxi is waiting outside.
I believe that's true.
I plan to do that first thing tomorrow.
What time will you get to the station?
Why did they turn down your proposal?
You're reading too much into the situation.
That is intriguing.
Tom is good at swimming.
Keep listening.
The car has a new engine.
This is a live broadcast.
I got soaked boating downriver.
What did they add this needless function for?
"400,000 gallons of oil have spilled out of the pipeline."
Why are you so angry with me?
I don't want anybody to know that I'm here.
There is little hope of her recovery.
I want another beer.
Tom isn't that old.
"Everyone is here, right?"
"You're really enjoying life, aren't you?"
The phone went dead.
The news caused a great sensation.
"If you practice doing that every day, you'll get better at it."
What is in this box?
Please make a copy of the first and second page.
Tom threw the apple core into the garbage can.
The store is closed on Mondays.
I went by bus as far as London.
She wouldn't let us help her.
He left his umbrella on the bus.
Breathe deeply through your mouth.
Does anyone have a tissue?
Would you like some more wine?
I don't work on Sunday.
Are you old enough to drink?
He's now on the boat.
I'm kind of tired of it.
The island is easy to reach by boat.
I can't trust anyone anymore.
Tom doesn't know anything.
Don't ask me.
"At last, they reached the top of the mountain."
She's curious to find out who sent the flowers.
Do you prefer white wine or red wine?
It was very warm outside.
It is kind of you to say so.
Do you think this is funny?
His eyes were blazing with anger.
I have two dogs. One is white and the other black.
The damage amounted to five million yen.
I got a yellow handkerchief on my birthday.
That species of bird is said to be in danger of dying out.
I met her by accident.
I must go now.
I know you're busy.
That perfume smells good.
The teacher taught them that the earth is round.
Don't leave the bicycle out in the rain.
You are in a safe place.
I plan to go to New York next week.
"If you climb up this mountain, you'll reach the lab."
The Mississippi is the longest river in the United States.
Everyone started panicking.
We had a good time playing chess.
Are you seeing someone?
I've been working all day.
Did anybody call for security?
Most people here can speak French.
Tom has plans for the weekend.
Do it quickly.
Was the book that you were reading yesterday in French?
"I should ask, shouldn't I?"
You must study much harder.
There's one thing you need to know.
I've decided to study kanji.
Whoever wants to come will be welcomed.
"If you do come up with something, let me know."
It's my younger brother's.
He went by bicycle.
I'll talk to Tom tomorrow.
I could not sleep because of the noise.
May I ask you some more questions?
I often watch night games on TV.
The surgery was a success.
Tom was asleep when the doorbell rang.
Tom pretended not to know the answer.
I don't know how to use it.
I wish I had enough time to sleep.
He was late for school yesterday.
That word isn't in the dictionary.
Your manners aren't very good.
Is it true that Tom is going to Boston?
"You'll get tired of a beautiful woman after three days, but you'll get used to an ugly one in the same amount of time."
He acts as if he were a king.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
The morning sun came in the window.
What do you want to ask me?
Put aside money for a rainy day.
I must prepare for the exam.
The door will be painted tomorrow.
Always keep your office tidy.
I thought that I'd already fixed it.
I went to the bookstore.
Your bath is ready.
We were thrilled by the news.
Who did you give it to?
Let's talk about it while we drink a cup of coffee.
I'll come as soon as I can.
Thanks for the cookies. They were delicious.
This plate is broken.
He was absent because of the storm.
The alarm rang and everyone had to evacuate.
Leave your umbrella at the front door.
I wish I had a sister.
"Don't worry! Even if I drink, it doesn't have an effect on my driving."
What would you do if you met a lion here?
"Hello, Tom."
Which team won the game?
Tom was given detention for talking during class.
It's painful to keep sitting for hours.
I almost got a perfect score.
I am not good at mathematics.
I'll either write to you or phone you next week.
Tom loves camping.
Stop talking and listen.
I don't eat apple cores.
What did you call me for?
I enjoyed myself.
What time did your friend go home?
That's a fair price.
I saw it with my own two eyes.
I think Tom is inflexible.

Let's keep in touch with each other.
How's life in Australia?
Her manner was cold.
How long will be you be staying in Australia?
Your success depends on whether you pass the STEP examination or not.
Come again tomorrow.
Are you really going to eat all that?
Don't blame me.
Get out of the way.
What on earth is this?
The author's name is familiar to us.
Tom cleared his throat.
Tom used to be a drug addict.
Winter is coming on.
Tom speaks fluently.
I don't know anything about him at all.
Do you have a history of ear infections?
That cocktail is sweet and easy to drink.
"Hi, guys."
Tom was arrested for drunken driving.
I bought it with my own money.
"I'm sorry, but that's impossible."
Tom won't remember you.
Poor Tom's been trying to get to sleep for three hours now.
Where exactly did you see Tom?
She married him when she was 20.
I'm fasting.
I thought that Tom might be waiting for us in front of the station.
"Drink this potion, and you'll be able to turn into whatever animal you want."
Can you tell me the WiFi password?
The door will open automatically.
It was a dirty trick.
He has a lot of money.
I don't deserve to live.
How did you learn how to play the violin?
I waited three hours for you.
He had a lot of things to do.
Tom gave a speech.
There are people who don't like spinach.
I expect him to help me.
I know that Tom has gone to Boston.
He recommended that I go there.
The cat retracted its claws.
The new semester has started.
How often do the buses run?
Don't come into my room without knocking.
A bus transported us from the airport to the city.
May I turn the lights on?
What type of girl is your type?
His birthday was yesterday.
Oranges contain a lot of vitamin C.
I had my secretary run off ten copies.
"I don't like Tom. ""I think that he doesn't like you, either."""
Those two boys are twins.
Do you remember what Tom was wearing?
We've talked about this before.
Are you on a team?
Vote for me!
Tom graduated from high school in 2013.
Don't forget us.
This isn't enough.
I know that story.
Tom leaned up against me.
What does all this add up to?
I'm sick of Boston.
His handwriting is poor.
Please open your books to page 86.
I admit it.
I rode on the back of my friend's bicycle.
She helped her daughter get dressed.
I don't think so.
He's absorbed in his work.
This camera was expensive.
"I tried to reach you on the phone, but I was unable to get through."
He attended to his business.
FORTRAN is a programming language.
I'll send you the link when I get home.
I have some work to do this evening.
He will have his own way.
That's just fine with me.
I didn't know you were so good at cooking.
Is this really spaghetti?
It was her fate to die young.
Have you ever tasted such a good soup?
Three people are missing after the flood.
I was only 10 years old when the big earthquake hit.
Who do you think will be elected president of the USA?
Tom's hands were covered in mud.
The food at that restaurant wasn't all that delicious.
We love them both.
I could swim well even when I was a child.
Tom was paralyzed with terror.
I get out of breath.
"Could you do this instead of me? ""Sorry, I'm too busy."""
Tom seemed to know that method.
That's like taking candy from a baby.
They were all surprised to see me there.
I've quit drinking beer.
"There isn't much I can do to help, I'm afraid."
Thanks for coming.
He dashed out of the store.
I think Tom is smart.
How did you like the movie?
I'll do it later on.
We work from nine to five.
The bus has already gone.
The news that the president was killed surprised them.
Tell him to wait.
Tom takes a pill with vitamins and minerals every day.
Probably no one will notice.
Tom is absent.
I know what to do.
She selected a hat to match her new dress.
Tom only drinks coffee.
I'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow.
I will accompany you.
Customers stopped coming to our shop.
It's too cold today for a picnic.
Let's talk next time.
She became aware that her parents were watching her.
That's not very important to me.
Thank you for your invitation.
Don't walk so fast. I can't keep up with you.
Is this French?
We usually call him Tom.
Tom and I disagreed on that point.
"I remembered your birthday this year, didn't I?"
I'm making a paper airplane.
I hope you have a good time in Europe.
"In high school, the girl that I had a crush on had a crush on Tom."
Thank you for your detailed explanation.
There's a small possibility that Tom will be arrested.
"My dad doesn't drink. ""Mine doesn't either."""
I thought that you were from Boston.
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
He was too embarrassed to do it.
"I was hungry, so I ate."
I can't believe Tom left without saying goodbye.
Why not go?
Hamburgers have gone up this week.
The clock is ticking.
I took a long trip last year.
He seems to know nothing about the matter.
Doing that wasn't as easy as I expected.
Are we going to cross this bridge?
What kind of a person does something like that?
You should prepare for tomorrow's lessons.
Tom didn't tell us his last name.
Hunting is forbidden in national parks.
It would've been nice if you'd helped me a little.
My dad would like to meet you.
We're eating dinner now.
Are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
What're you doing now?
I'll solve that problem.
He must be the one for me.
I could hardly tell who was who.
I can run.
That was interesting.
Why are Tom and Mary here?
"In ancient times, plagues killed many people."
Don't tell me you don't like chocolate.
They were all sold out.
"I can hear you, but I can't see you."
I worked on it day after day.
Would you please go shopping with me?
I never noticed that.
My shoes are worn out.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
No rich people live here.
There was a lot of snow last winter.
I've never thought about it.
Let me know once you've decided when you'll come.
You should've seen the movie last night.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I don't mind reading manuals.
We had a quick lunch at a cafe.
Do you think I should quit my job?
That isn't my cup of tea.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
I lost my way in the woods.
Tom promised me he'd be more careful in the future.
You ought to write a book.
The evidence is clear.
Be calm.
I enjoyed driving on the new highway.
We want to learn some Spanish songs.
"Tom loved singing. However, no one wanted to listen to him sing."
It took a long time for me to get used to the noise.
You don't have to make excuses.
Could you please take a picture?
"It is very cold today, isn't it?"
They're always complaining.
I don't have an older sister.
Neither Tom nor Mary can speak French.
"The first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, launched by Russia in 1957."
This dress suits you well.
Mary is 36 weeks pregnant.
How old is this church?
We love you.
"The world is unfair, isn't it?"
I was out all day.
I think it's worth a try.
You are the only one who can carry the bag.
"My sister hasn't come home yet, so my mother is worried."
Don't keep me waiting.
Tom fixed the flat tire by himself.
What are you reading?
Tom looks cool no matter what he wears.
He called me a cab.
I asked him to do that.
I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary can't speak French.
I'm amazed at his rapid progress in English.
They won't believe me.
My mom thought I'd be a football player.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
I'm on good terms with the neighbors.
This is a small token of my gratitude.
Three people are missing.
He left for New York a week ago.
Tom said that he didn't like my dress.
What're you looking for?
Why do I need to go to Boston?
She promised her father to be in time for lunch.
The question is who will do it.
I've known it all along.
Is there a similar proverb in Japan?
What is in the garden?
Do you all have pencils?
Even Japanese can make mistakes when they speak Japanese.
There is a TV in this room.
This could become a serious problem.
My wet clothes clung to my body.
I feel very sick. I want to throw up.
I had the gardener plant some trees.
I dropped out of school when I was in the 7th grade.
I've heard all about it.
"You guys haven't eaten yet, have you?"
The climate here is like that of France.
Send for the doctor at once.
I want to know the reasons why.
"She seems reserved, but she's actually a strong-willed person."
Was the party fun?
We were in danger of losing our lives.
Did you get an answer from Tom?
Don't overexert yourself.
Let's go get a hot dog or something.
"In that case, I think you should come in today."
I like Tom because he's honest.
There are a great many books in this library.
Good riddance.
Are you interested in music?
There are no perfect people.
One cannot erase the past.
What did Tom buy you?
Tom just loves pineapple upside-down cake.
There was a castle here many years ago.
Get lost.
The lake is deepest at this spot.
Please show me what to do next.
We're not like you.
Thank you in advance for your help.
I'm as busy as ever.
Math is really hard.
He was somewhat disappointed to hear the news.
The answer misses the point.
You can stay as long as you like.
"To put it bluntly, I don't like Tom."
Yeah. I was the one who called you last night.
Have you been busy recently?
I am familiar with the author's name.
Cats are smaller than dogs.
Environmental pollution is causing abnormal weather conditions.
I'm itching to do that.
There's a shopping area nearby.
We eat every evening at six.
I was out for a walk.
He bought a plane ticket.
I want to go overseas.
Tom's condition got worse.
What did you put in the box?
I really enjoyed myself tonight.
She changed the subject.
I missed the train by only one minute.
Don't interfere.
We really like picnics.
I can't afford a holiday.
I thought that you were going to be at home last night.
Arabic is written from right to left.
He went there on business.
There are some things you can't learn from books.
That's common sense.
It was a great blow to us.
I'll lend you my notebook.
All the players were in position.
Please give me a book.
This country is rich in oil.
He's not the kind of person who always criticizes others.
Look at that smoke.
How long is the flight from Tokyo to Hawaii?
Please shut the door.
Tom bought Mary a dress.
Are you sure you can handle this?
That can't be true.
A man is not always what he seems.
I hear that his father is in another country.
"Every time a species dies out, we lose forever a part of our natural world."
We're playing baseball after work today.
The room is warming up.
I want an apple.
Tom can't tie his own shoes yet.
Tom carefully opened the box.
I don't care whether Tom stays or not.
Signs of social unrest are mounting.
Both are possible.
My eyesight isn't as good as it used to be.
My piggy bank is nearly full.
I dislike them all.
I understand how you feel.
What are you planning to do for the New Year vacation?
He chastised them for being noisy.
Are you busy tomorrow night?
"Oh, just my luck!"
Do you know how many people in the world starve to death every year?
Which one do you want to eat first?
I hope to see you again soon.
Finns drink a lot of coffee.
I might be wrong.
It's a disease that can't be prevented.
"I noticed that, too."
"I planned to become a teacher, but I never did."
There wasn't a soul in sight.
Dad's not home.
I'll visit Boston with Tom.
"Which do you like better, dogs or cats?"
Tom might get fired.
You're incredibly cute.
I can't wait to die.
Tom's new wife is younger than his daughter from his first marriage.
He was nearly run over by a car.
He is not as old as he seems.
Didn't I tell you to clean your room?
People your age often have this problem.
There is a toy shop in the neighborhood.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom had a quick breakfast.
When can you come to my home?
He likes to work in the garden.
I've never worn a tuxedo.
Do your gums bleed?
I've been to Australia three times.
How much for half a kilo?
What's made you decide to work for our company?
Is this really real?
Don't be angry.
He's a tiger when he's angry is an example of metaphor.
I've forgotten your number.
I asked her out.
I need to buy a new carpet for this room.
I'll bring something to drink.
I got a weird email.
I'll give you a ring tomorrow morning.
Tom is very mad.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I think I see something.
Are you fat?
What do you call this vegetable in English?
I wrote five letters before I went to bed.
Have you made sure the door is locked?
"Tom, my roommate, is a very nice guy."
It was cold yesterday.
What do you guys think?
"Pianos are expensive, but cars are even more expensive."
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend.
He is a fast runner.
What were you all doing at that time?
I was mistaken.
I don't like the red jacket.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Are you seeing someone?
The price of oil is going up.
Do you take plastic?
How long were you in the hospital?
I didn't borrow anything.
I have some numbness in my left hand.
The room was hot.
I wanted to say thank you.
This movie is indeed a timeless masterpiece.
Refrain from smoking here.
Can I use your telephone?
I forgot to lock the storeroom.
How old are Tom's parents?
I'd like to make an appointment for my three-year-old son.
What size shoes do you wear?
My mother is Canadian.
"We had no customers, so we shut the shop early."
They crossed the vast continent on foot.
I won't be home this afternoon.
"No, thank you. I'm full."
Are you sure that Tom didn't do that?
Are you going to the store?
His fingers ran swiftly over the keys.
I get lonely at times.
It's a bit too complicated for me.
"In spring, the days become longer."
I'd be happy if you'd come.
I was born in 1980.
He was exposed to danger.
The heavy rain prevented us from going fishing.
I'll buy a Ford.
I just want to be alone.
I don't think these ink stains will come off.
She went with him.
There is no chair in this room.
I have a lot of relatives.
This is a free ticket.
I read the whole book in one evening.
We walked a lot.
Why did you run away?
Tom is beating Mary up.
"Put on a sweater. If you don't, you'll catch a cold."
I paid him five dollars.
He often eats breakfast here.
I think that it'll rain tomorrow.
I don't want to miss my flight.
I have a problem.
I wish I'd been born a cat.
He looks young.
The milk has gone bad.
I'm not good at reading maps.
We are learning Arabic.
Don't try to do all these things at once.
"You haven't told anyone, have you?"
Did you bring them home?
Tom never laughed.
I'll repair it now.
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I found the bed quite comfortable.
"Buy two, get one free."
Tom went for a walk.
That's honey.
Are you sure this is the right road?
Dogs are faithful animals.
Is it a bomb?
She fainted when she saw blood.
He is a soccer player.
"In a word, life is short."
That ticket is good until April 29th.
I'm sleepy.
The young man was disappointed in love.
There are some apples in the basket.
Tom didn't let us do that.
That a boy!
I saw her swim.
I asked him to slowly read off the numbers on the meter.
My name's Tom.
My mother insists that I should not go out after dark.
Nobody knows the future.
Will the fine weather keep up till tomorrow?
You must stop smoking.
I didn't receive anything.
Please keep in touch.
These questions can be answered quite simply.
We were attacked by swarms of bees.
Tom had no idea why everybody was laughing.
Washing is my work.
The town has many narrow lanes.
My brother didn't like her from the first time he met her.
"Do you like cake? ""Yes, I do."""
I can't bring myself to eat anything.
What's your favorite French wine?
Everybody liked Tom.
The house is not in very good condition.
Speak more slowly.
Do I have to open the window?
There was frost on my windshield this morning.
I found it pretty hard to adjust to my new surroundings.
Please rinse out your mouth.
Look at that pretty little girl.
Did she show you the picture?
I think I've met Tom before.
I want to walk in the rain.
Tom practices piano every day.
Tom signed the contract this morning.
There are a lot of new buildings here now.
I want ice cream for dessert.
It looks like today will be a long day.
"Strictly speaking, she didn't like it at all, but she didn't say a thing."
What is it?
I made a lot of new friends.
Do you love my brother more than me?
Sugar dissolves in hot coffee.
Give me some time to think.
May I open the windows?
It was as hard as rock.
Are you married now?
This is broken.
This beer mug holds one pint.
"I have work to do, so go away and leave me alone."
Don't play with that key!
Tom said Mary likes you.
Lend me a hand.
The lamb was killed by the wolf.
He made me out to be a liar.
What do you think I've been doing?
Open your book to the first page.
Who are you doing that for?
That singer is popular with girls.
My father often falls asleep while watching television.
I need to buy a new carpet for this room.
This is one of the reasons I like Boston.
You're wearing your T-shirt inside out.
What do you think you'll score on tomorrow's test?
Will you go by train?
"Can you open the door, please?"
This is a car for young people.
I'm going to change and I'll be back.
I can't look at this photo without feeling very sad.
Her dream is to become a nurse.
"Give me some milk, too."
I'll see you at 2:30.
I don't think that this is interesting.
Tom replied that he was sorry.
This job isn't hard.
I was having lunch.
I hate girls like that.
Tom pokes his nose into everything.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
"If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay at home."
The latter is better than the former.
Last night was exceptionally cold.
Tom didn't come to school last week.
He is allergic to house dust.
"Stop, or I'll shoot."
Tom hasn't had anything but water since last night.
It is unlikely that such a cool headed person got upset.
Come here and have a look at it.
Why don't you help him?
What do you think of this sweater?
I've told you a million times not to exaggerate.
Guess what he told me.
Are you going to do that all by yourself?
Where did I put the car key?
Why do cats purr?
King size beds are really big.
Isn't Halloween in October?
How many Christmas cards did you send?
You can't win them all.
I'm just looking.
Please pick up your ticket at the counter.
I've never been kissed before.
He has much more money than I have.
My father built a new house for me.
Tom likes reading sports newspapers.
Do you like music?
My brother is two years older than I am.
The heavy snow prevented us from going to the concert.
I'm back on my feet.
Almost no one thinks that we are sisters.
It's a fake.
There is a stranger in front of the house.
It looks like a nice house.
Why do you like sports so much?
He is our English teacher.
"The words ""small"" and ""little"" are synonyms."
He regained consciousness in the hospital.
How tall is your brother?
You'd better go to bed at once.
Which beer is Tom's?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that serious.
You just need to press this button to take a picture.
Grandpa bought it for me!
The witness identified the thief in the police lineup.
I can do without this.
They waited for him for hours.
"Tom, I want you to do something for me."
"Although she is gone, I still love her more than anything."
Take care.
Turn left.
Draw a small circle.
I found the diary that my father kept for 30 years.
I'll give you as many as you like.
Are you going to go shopping next weekend?
I couldn't help laughing.
He finished his chores in no time.
"Tom can't ride a bike, but Mary can."
I have to get out of here right away.
Strike while the iron's hot.
You're just running away from life's problems.
Can you say that again?
Let's pitch our tent here.
It sounds like you're busy.
I totally agree.
You need a passport to enter a foreign country.
Was Tom hospitalized?
They gave in to my opinion.
I gave him a ride in my car last night.
When's the next meeting? I hope it's not on Monday.
I know where Tom and Mary are hiding.
All you have to do is wash the dishes.
I'll teach you how to drive.
Tom bought this camera for a reasonable price.
My stomach is full.
"If that were true, what would you do?"
I like baseball very much.
There's no way Tom would lend me his car.
I'm not very particular about food.
Tom belittled Mary.
He's second to none.
Does Tom have a pet?
Don't be rude.
It's a secret.
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
When did you begin studying French?
Make sure the light is green before crossing.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Is it true that Tom changed his name?
Why aren't you wearing your sunglasses?
Don't touch this.
I thought I heard someone knocking on the door.
I told Tom not to play in the road.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
I was on the point of leaving home when a light rain started to fall.
How are you doing?
I don't want to eat lunch with Tom.
Tom has given me something I don't want.
I'll call you up later.
I love watching TV.
The thief slipped into the house.
Tom owes Mary slightly over a thousand dollars.
I sometimes have a pain in my stomach.
"This doesn't concern you, Tom."
I didn't know he had a weak heart.
I'll help you.
"I came here to see if there was something I could do to help, but there doesn't seem to be anything for me to do."
Do you know what Tom died of?
We could freeze to death.
She has plenty of books.
That's not how we do things here.
You can't go against the laws of nature.
The ocean was calm.
She's an outspoken person.
We make grapes into wine.
I don't have any money on me.
"If you do it, I'll do it, too."
I prefer blue to red.
There are some cookies in the jar.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
I was speechless.
My father came home.
We walked for about three kilometers.
Minors aren't allowed to enter.
Is there a message?
His team is likely to win.
That's funny.
I feel better now.
Is she your only daughter?
Silk feels soft.
I promise to stay longer next time.
Tom didn't buy Mary anything.
Don't be ridiculous.
The refrigerator is open.
We have four classes in the morning.
When did you start studying French?
My trousers don't have pockets.
Do you really think that it's bad?
My driver's license will expire next week.
The cat ran after the rat.
I've never been abroad.
This is my bag.
There's no need to be scared.
Where did you buy your motorbike?
I read my horoscope every day.
I received an item that I didn't order.
I'm no longer a child.
Tom typed in the password.
"On average, how many cups of coffee do you drink every day?"
Tom got wounded.
Tom is watering his garden.
Did Tom really say that?
The job is a lot of fun.
Who ate my snacks?
She considered his offer carefully.
That was probably what influenced their decision.
He was very patient.
I slid down the banister.
"Sorry, but I can't go with you."
That was an excellent game.
"Tom, I bet you'd be a good teacher."
I found a stone shaped like a heart.
Tom opened a can of ice-cold root beer and poured it over his ice cream.
Is your father at home now?
She likes traveling best of all.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your conversation.
Almost all girls are kind.
Keep in touch.
The two men were released from jail.
Almost all the leaves have fallen.
Tom wasn't able to answer Mary's questions.
"I do many things at the same time, so not only am I reading things by Akutagawa, I've also increased the amount of time I spend reading in English and I also read a little in German every day."
Isn't that the Golden Gate Bridge?
He came back home a while ago.
Was Tom fired?
I'm a bit anxious.
She got up at seven in the morning.
Tom and I got married in October.
I've finally gotten used to living in the city.
Tom came back home covered in mud.
I threw away my shoes.
The document was nowhere to be found.
You did well not to follow his advice.
I got lost on my way home.
Are you planning to be here all afternoon?
Where did you get this beautiful dress?
It's too cold here.
"Covered with dust, the doll stood in the corner of the room."
How do I get to the beach from here?
He is always looking to the future.
I got up at six-thirty this morning.
Does Tom still believe in ghosts?
He picked up the rifle and aimed it at the target.
Could you give me some advice?
My wife keeps track of our finances.
"As soon as Tom turned on the TV, the fuse blew."
I am a twin.
How about going for a drive?
I can't find the price tag.
She has no manners.
"I found the work easy, since I had done that kind of work before."
Tom may not want to sing.
She loves the peace and quiet of the town.
There's a fire down the hall.
Spring will be here soon.
The park has a large pond.
Can I borrow your pen?
I was stung by a bee.
Tom doesn't do that very much.
I visited my father's grave.
Many friends came to see me off.
Did you clean your room?
"When I was a child, my mother would often read fairy tales to me."
He plays soccer.
Tom lost both of his parents when he was quite young.
The leaves on the trees have begun to turn red.
"Without water, we would soon die."
Name three types of bread.
I'm not at all tired.
I have a craving for fresh fruit.
Please give me a glass of milk.
I had hoped to meet you there.
I'm looking for a house.
What did you say?
I'm engaged in AIDS research.
"It's a bit warm in here, isn't it?"
I look forward to hearing from you.
Tom likes Mary a lot.
Do you like to study?
What are you mad about?
Are you waiting for anybody?
I was swimming in the pool at that time.
What do you say we go skiing?
A friend lent me that book.
There isn't much difference between the two opinions.
Be at the station at 11 o'clock sharp.
We have time to spare.
The man couldn't so much as write his own name.
You can stay as long as you like.
Is anything wrong?
I totally forgot today was Tom's birthday.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Tom hired a private detective.
You ought to trust me.
"I'd like some more bread, please."
I've got to learn some new songs.
"It's my fault, not yours."
He had to call on all his experience to carry out the plan.
There will be snow tomorrow.
Do you know how to play mahjong?
Is Tom still planning on doing that?
Is Tom well?
Both of us ought to do that.
Where is the check-in counter?
"Could I get some water, please?"
It's not a major problem.
My wife doesn't cook.
"How would you translate this sentence, Tom?"
Is it true you got married?
Drop me a line.
She's been having trouble with back pain for years.
Why do you speak French so well?
Wouldn't you rather sit by the window?
Mind your own business.
I corrected myself.
I had him paint the gate last week.
My body aches all over.
I wonder whether it'll rain tomorrow.
She achieved her goal.
Is there something you'd like to say to Tom?
Are you out of your mind?
I believe the actions that Tom took were right.
I'll open the curtain for you to look out.
"After I came to, it took me a while to realize where I was."
Please tell me when to go.
Don't go above the speed limit.
Are you done with your homework yet?
That isn't Tom's car.
"I'd like a sandwich, please."
Are you a teacher?
What was the outcome of the election?
"As far as I know, this book has never been translated into French."
He lives in Tokyo.
Have you ever eaten insects?
"He was impolite, not to say rude."
He went aboard the plane.
I'm not sure that Tom did that.
I just don't know what to say.
Why don't we take a short break?
Close your eyes.
Is anyone here?
Is it OK if I come in?
You can open your eyes.
Tom said Mary has been robbed before.
Tom translated the document into French.
A good student like Tom brings honor to our class.
My feet are smaller than yours.
Tom is liked by everybody.
What are you looking at?
Let's go to the zoo.
The view is stunning.
I felt ill at ease.
I work every day except Sunday.
Sometimes I get sad.
I really do hate this.
That word's not in the dictionary.
I want to get a connecting flight to Boston.
"You don't like chocolate, do you?"
My dream is to travel in a space shuttle.
I'll carry this suitcase for you.
We work in a factory.
Tom is interested in math.
The snow melted.
There were a lot of excited fans in the stadium.
We love going on picnics.
How do you go to school?
Will you please explain to me the exact meaning of the word?
We may as well wait.
My schedule is pretty packed.
I love you more than anything.
Rise and shine.
He has accumulated quite a collection of books.
"The box has a ""Fragile"" sticker on it."
Tom started studying French three years ago.
I've been waiting for three years.
I tried writing a novel.
Can I talk to you outside?
Please don't buy it.
Why don't you try on this yellow sweater?
"I'm so happy for you, Tom."
It's time to take a bath.
No one was present.
My school marks were average.
Why do you need a knife?
I knew Tom was studying.
They had nothing to eat.
Lincoln's biography is read by children all around the world.
He apologized to me for stepping on my foot.
This is the pencil that she used to write it.
He talks too fast.
You're not to leave this room.
It was Tom who taught me how to do this.
Are you going to the movies?
Is Tom awake yet?
It'll be fine tomorrow.
Tom handed Mary a cup.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom thinks he can do it.
I can't do that this week.
She is always finding fault with other people.
I've decided to go to Boston instead of Chicago.
Don't catch a cold.
I've always wanted to be a father.
He took out a book about the history of coins.
Stand back from the rope.
The heavy rain kept the children in all day.
We helped one another.
I am amazed at your audacity.
I'd like to swim in this river.
She's very beautiful.
Many things can be made from wood.
Is today an unlucky day?
I neither drink nor smoke.
Where were you guys today?
Everyone has to memorize those words.
Are there enough chairs?
I'd rather go today than tomorrow.
I can't reach things on the top shelf.
Tom doesn't like reading books on the train.
I'll take back everything I said.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Have you already had dinner?
It was not until this year that these documents were made available to the public.
She disappeared.
My dream is to be a baseball player.
Can you spare me a few minutes? I need your help.
I know almost nothing about that.
Could you get in touch with him?
Bring Tom in here.
Something happened.
She cooks for him every day.
Tom is a left-handed pitcher.
"She grew up near the sea, yet she hates swimming."
Why does it hurt when you get sweat in your eyes?
I was in Tokyo yesterday.
I've never drunk wine.
I'm going to be there for three weeks.
You need to exercise more.
Leave that box where it is.
Please shut the door.
I wanted her to win.
Please wait in front of Room 213.
I have some money.
He is lying on the sofa.
"It's really hot today, isn't it? ""Yeah, it sure is."""
Quit eating so quickly. You should eat more slowly.
Please turn off the lights.
We spent a peaceful day in the countryside.
Tom is on a camping trip.
My house is near the school.
There are no roses without thorns.
You know that I don't like eggs.
I drank too much and the ground seemed to spin under my feet.
The room is covered with dust.
Our car broke down on our way there.
What would you say?
I prefer reading to writing.
I'm getting excited.
What's going on?
Someone has come.
He isn't actually the manager.
There wasn't a soul in sight.
Can you add these numbers?
I'm afraid it won't work.
The stomach is one of the internal organs.
My family isn't very large.
Won't you sit down?
How much is the entrance fee?
The jacket's big on me.
How do you use this camera?
I'm wearing my best clothes today.
It's simple to use.
I thought that you'd be in your room.
I read the label.
Tom closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
Tom wants to know why Mary isn't here.
She is mad at me.
I'll be in touch.
I tried to lose weight.
Let's all stay at the same hotel.
The important thing is to have your own hobby.
Tom has lost his eraser.
I don't believe Tom can win.
Tom sounds like a nice guy.
I'm going to carry out this plan.
There are some books on the desk.
"I'd like to invite you to lunch, if you're not busy."
I slipped and twisted my ankle.
I heard a loud noise coming from outside my window.
You look contented.
She was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
How was today's game?
That has nothing to do with you.
I had my son water the lawn.
Could you just shut up for a bit?
She is on the wrong side of twenty.
Are you and Tom still friends?
The young men said that they would do it despite all of the difficulties.
"Dad, Tom is using your computer."
I have seen her before.
I think you should go now.
The drought has done great harm to the crops.
We should make every effort to maintain world peace.
What would you like to do?
Our class reunion brought back old memories of when we were students.
Tom won the race.
Tom looked at the price tag and realized he didn't have enough money.
They all speak French.
You can't attend? Why not?
Today isn't so muggy.
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
"I was tired, but I couldn't sleep."
Tom shot this video.
My weight is 58 kilograms.
I became a director.
That's not exactly what I said.
Tom built an igloo in his backyard.
I have never heard him speak ill of others.
My grandmother lives in the country.
Call an ambulance.
Dr. Jackson has a lot of patients.
Were you fat when you were in high school?
Add salt and baking soda to the water.
I have nothing in particular to say about this situation.
She is fond of animals.
He stabbed me in the back!
We are very busy and short-handed.
Let's start over.
Tom has a secret.
I can't really help you at all.
Is this the first time you've flown a helicopter?
Tom picked his pencil up and started to write.
My sister is shorter than you.
Tom escaped from the danger.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
"You aren't able to swim, are you?"
Tom wanted his son to live in the city.
December 24th is Christmas Eve.
"If you keep practicing, you'll get better at it."
Tom said Mary was mistaken.
She's reluctant to marry him.
I'd like to hear Tom's opinion as well.
The roads are jammed with cars.
"Tom and Mary are still single, aren't they?"
"I called her office, but no one answered."
Why did I buy flowers? Is that what you just said? It's really noisy here so I couldn't hear you very well.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
"Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice."
Were you listening to me?
I made no promises.
"In spite of the bad weather, they decided to go by car."
My father laid his hand on my shoulder.
I know Tom is short.
There is no objection on my part.
He hid his money.
These are Tom's glasses.
I watched Tom cross the street.
What are you guys doing?
I'm not guilty.
The traveler was delighted at the sight of a light in the distance.
That's all I wanted to say.
What time are you leaving?
It often rains here.
I was born and brought up here.
It had an effect very different from the one intended.
I still don't understand.
He got tired and turned back.
He came by bus.
Tom ate popcorn.
It's harder than you think.
He seems to be rich now.
How do I do this?
Is it OK not to eat this?
Mary is very gentle with her baby sister.
I used to play here as a child.
You only live once.
We had a wonderful time.
Tom is really good at math.
She pushed him off the pier.
Maybe I'll just wander off on my own.
May I use your toilet?
He is already here.
I promise you I'll help you.
I'll never eat pasta again.
I think that Tom is a good driver.
We had to cooperate with each other.
I had a bit too much.
This is bulletproof glass.
What's the speed limit on this road?
It's so weird.
Are you sure about this?
Do you have any brothers?
A lot of things happened that night.
Don't open your umbrella in the lobby.
Everybody was jealous of my success.
Tell Tom I won't be needing his help.
I want to get better at playing the guitar.
He accepted our offer.
Are you wearing gloves?
Two men are trying to figure out what's wrong with the car.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
What time did he get there?
Who will look after the baby?
She tried it herself.
My girlfriend is older than me.
We all laughed at his pink tuxedo.
Tom doesn't want to play billiards.
Are you hungry yet?
I think the fun is just beginning.
I should've followed Tom's advice.
What did you have for supper last night?
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
What are you studying?
I also know a thing or two about cooking.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
"You're worried, aren't you?"
I want to go to school.
Please iron the shirt.
Did you do this by yourself?
Aren't you still working in Boston?
He placed the ladder against the fence.
Let's ease up.
"When I bite down, this tooth hurts."
Are you going to give this to Tom?
You keep out of this.
This isn't for me.
"You saw that movie, didn't you?"
Read French books.
He is able to speak ten languages.
I can't help feeling sorry for him.
I've never seen a giraffe.
Tom came home for the Thanksgiving weekend.
Let's do some exercise to work up an appetite.
Let me congratulate you on your success.
Are you pregnant?
It is surprising that your wife should object.
"You love your father, right?"
I took care of the cat.
I did nothing.
The residents set fire to their own houses as the enemy approached.
It was a breeze.
What have you been up to?
Tom already ate.
I spent the whole morning reading a book.
"She loves Tom, not me."
The children ran toward the classroom.
I'm studying now.
Please give me your permanent address.
Who's next?
I prefer soccer to baseball.
It was very cold last month.
Tom offended Mary.
Hug Tom.
I'm opposed to any type of war.
No one has come yet.
Half the students were absent.
Are you doing anything special for New Year's Eve?
I hope it's helpful.
Why were you late this morning?
"You know you need to do that, don't you?"
You smell like you've been smoking.
This is the village where I was born.
I got furious.
I sat up all night.
Tom is waiting for you in the park.
Did he tell you the truth?
I would like mine rare.
Tom's older.
Mary is really a nice girl.
It was raining outside.
Teach me how to do it.
Don't count on him to lend you any money.
I like Tom more than you do.
Tom strolled down the street.
I have friends who are vegetarians.
Amnesty International often organizes public protests in support of political prisoners.
We study French.
He acquainted himself with his job.
The sky is covered with clouds.
We're leaving here soon.
What's your name?
I want to see it for myself.
The game was called off.
I don't feel like going for a walk.
It cost me a fortune to get my car repaired.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
I'm sure Tom will be surprised.
"The phone rang, but nobody answered."
You should know better than to ask a lady her age.
I think Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
My brother is three years younger than me.
I lost my passport. I'll have to get a new one.
Don't just sit there. Start taking notes.
Bottoms up!
Be careful on your way back home.
Tom read the story out loud.
He came by car instead of by train.
Look at those fish in the pond.
Those who want to join the club should sign here.
Does Tom have any brothers and sisters?
"Mary is waiting outside, isn't she?"
I think you're imagining things.
"If Tom wants to stay, I have no objection."
Tom taught me a lot of things.
I couldn't take my eyes off Tom.
I know that Tom likes Mary.
Use your head.
Are there any beautiful parks in Japan?
We can't afford to take chances.
Was that necessary?
I don't care if it snows.
The church is located in the center of the village.
The knife isn't sharp.
"Mary resembles her mother in looks, but not in personality."
Mountain climbing isn't something that I really enjoy so much.
How is Tanabata celebrated in Japan?
Japan is not as large as Canada.
He will come tomorrow.
Is that the man whose wife was killed in the car accident?
Tom opened the door for us.
Be quiet while I am speaking.
How many pages are there in this book?
"You can swim, can't you?"
The dog was wagging his tail.
That house with a red roof is my uncle's.
The prime minister will make an announcement tomorrow.
I'll pick you up at the station at noon.
Tom disappeared while out on bail.
Who is that person?
I'm Tom's friend.
It's OK to cry.
She stared at the man in silent astonishment.
There are lots of rocks in this garden.
Grass won't grow here.
How many times a week do you take a bath?
"Oh, I'm sorry."
Tom is sitting at the table near the window.
Tom got injured playing soccer.
I had almost finished my work when she came.
I'm a woman.
Every morning she gets up early because she has to cook.
Do you prefer tea with lemon or milk?
Are you going to kiss me?
I think it's possible.
There are other fish in the sea.
How shall we deal with this matter?
Don't lie to me.
We're happy.
We're having an examination in geometry tomorrow.
Would you like a cup of milk?
No other dog is bigger than this.
"Even at the end of the nineteenth century, sailors in the British Navy were not permitted to use knives and forks because using them was considered a sign of weakness."
I am a bachelor.
That exercise is good for the abdominal muscles.
She is kind.
She has a large mansion.
Everyone is equal before the law.
It's Monday today.
Tom and I went to the same high school. He was two years below me.
Are you feeling tired?
"Last year, I traveled abroad with a friend."
My brother-in-law is older than I am.
She regretted that she had not followed his advice.
She is very intelligent.
Many young people go abroad during summer vacation.
Please get in.
"The new model will retail for 30,000 yen."
He mailed a letter home.
Tom isn't stupid.
I'm looking forward to next summer.
Please open your bag.
It's more common than you think.
Tom threw his cell phone against the wall.
You all did a very good job.
The scandal hurt the company's reputation.
Shut the door.
The lemonade is cold.
They confronted each other.
You can't trust Tom.
The cup has a crack.
How about me stopping by?
I went to see a movie last night.
You have dirty hands.
"Where's his book? ""It's on the table."""
Could you turn it down?
I ate lunch with my friends.
"I play chess, too."
I didn't go with her.
"Right now, there are many things I need to do."
I want to go home and sleep.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Let me see how it works.
What time is it?
I only meant it as a joke.
Tom promised to send the check by mail.
I usually go home at four.
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
I don't think that Tom will like this place.
Why don't you try and trust Tom a little more?
"The higher we climbed, the colder it got."
I had my hair cut at the barber's.
"She promised to meet him last night, but she never showed up."
She didn't like her husband.
Tom ate my lunch.
Tom is possessive.
Tom disliked Mary.
Are you sleepy yet?
Wouldn't you like another glass of beer?
Tom was still in high school at the time.
He can speak both English and French very well.
The principal came in after the teacher.
"If I had enough money, I could go abroad."
Tom should've been home on Monday.
We talked quietly so we wouldn't wake the baby.
Have you seen my keys?
That child's name is Tom.
I have no money.
I have a nice present to give you.
I asked Tom where he wanted to go.
He is unquestionably the oldest man in the village.
"Wait a minute, please."
Tom sang the song that I requested.
"Tom, can you come tomorrow?"
You're hearing things.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Tom doesn't like drinking.
She devoted all her energy to studying Spanish.
I've burnt the toast.
My house is situated on the other side of that bridge.
I wonder whether this water is really drinkable.
Tom hasn't done anything wrong.
Are you still mad about last night?
Please do that again.
I like tennis very much.
I've seen it before.
You must keep your hands clean.
It happened in 2013.
My sixty-year-old aunt inherited the huge estate.
You should mind your parents.
My uncle comes back from America next Monday.
Does Tom play in a band?
Give me some more tea.
Do I have to take this medicine?
I burned the roof of my mouth.
Why don't we go out for dinner tonight?
Tom speaks only French at home.
I'm terribly sorry.
The soccer game is tomorrow.
You're lying.
It's an hour's walk to the station.
What is it you want to buy?
I'll visit a museum today.
You should speak as clearly as possible.
They rented the room on the second floor to a student.
He is not in.
We took a walk in the park.
We have plenty of time to spare.
Someone who knows English well must have written this.
What a beautiful flower!
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
Green is my favorite color.
Mary seems to be OK.
I was forced to go.
I'll do it at home.
I had lots of fun skating.
That sounds good to me.
That's a good idea!
Why are you saying that to me?
I was really busy.
Tom came into the room without knocking.
There is a limit to everything.
I love your smile.
Father comes home from work about nine in the evening.
Could you please put me up for the night?
I don't believe you. You're always telling lies.
Let me know the result as soon as you can.
I'm not so brave.
The women of France are beautiful.
I have to take my suit to the cleaners.
The man aimed a gun at the detectives.
You look a lot like your sister.
I am glad to be with you.
What did you buy?
Is Tom studying French?
School was fun.
Do you have a dictionary?
I'll give you anything you want.
Are you in a bad mood?
Tom has won.
The baby is called Tom.
I was amazed at the speed of the car.
He's an author.
Can someone call security?
I didn't know Tom used to work in Boston.
The alarm went off at five-thirty.
Were you at the party?
Is it true Tom joined a cult?
She grew roses.
I caught a bad cold.
No problem!
She threw him out.
Everyone smiles in the same language.
We need the money.
I prefer fish to meat.
"If Tom goes, I will, too."
Nobody cares what you think.
Tom likes sitting on the beach in the early morning.
I was laughed at by everyone.
I got the ticket for free.
A yard is equal to three feet.
Do you have a bank account?
This window doesn't shut well.
I've been in that line of work for five years.
I can't put up with him.
We shouldn't judge people based on their appearance.
I still have a lot of work to do.
"Even when she thought about something else, ideas of death returned to her mind."
They are always hard up for food.
I almost left my umbrella on the train.
Skating on the pond is dangerous.
The train is 30 minutes overdue.
Tom didn't know how to respond.
I wonder if Mary is wearing eye shadow.
Do you like trips?
I need a kitchen knife.
"Because of her, he lived a miserable life."
I thought it was unusual that he was up so late at night.
We usually have a slice of bread and a cup of coffee.
Where did you live last year?
He went into the bank in the disguise of a guard.
The situation is growing progressively worse.
Turn your bag inside out.
It'll take a long time.
You'd better start at once.
What is done cannot be undone.
I'm not dead yet.
I often listen to sad songs.
"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
Don't feed the dog.
Why didn't you call me last night?
"Small and ""little"" are synonyms."
There is a right time for everything.
"Tom is very, very rich."
Tom said he'd call at 2:30.
It was all for nothing.
I was deeply moved by that novel.
This sofa takes too much room.
Do you know where she is?
We aren't foreigners.
I bought a watch and I lost it the next day.
I asked him where I should park my car.
"Now that my brother is a university student, he has to do a lot of reading."
When did it stop snowing?
"Japan's gold and foreign exchange reserves stood at $68.9 billion at the end of 1998, down from $77.0 billion a year earlier."
It's hot in the summer.
It was a beautiful sunny day.
My house was on fire.
Am I fired?
My parents aren't home much.
"I can't promise a reply, but you can send mail to me."
My apartment gets plenty of sunshine.
She took care of the children.
All this walking is killing the soles of my feet and my toes. I wonder if I have the right size shoes.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and smiled.
I don't like stubborn people.
Would it be OK if I hugged you?
How do you know that?
Can you pick me up at 3?
I found this under your bed.
Tom plays the piano every day.
I write to my mother once a month.
It was nothing.
Some people like coffee and others prefer tea.
I'm taking an exam in January.
We stayed at an economy hotel.
Is it true that Tom is in jail?
Is this the first time you've ever skied?
Please come right away.
Is this the first time you've been here?
This table is made out of wood.
He boarded the ship.
You speak very fast.
"If we'd taken that plane, we'd be dead now."
I want to stay in America for a few years.
Please show that to me.
I don't know what it is.
Don't worry about what people say.
This really tastes good.
He got away disguised as a policeman.
I've got blisters on my feet.
The year 1980 saw the fastest economic growth in that country.
I wore sunglasses to protect my eyes from the sun.
I don't wear pajamas.
Tom doesn't know I'm Canadian.
My grandfather is 90 years old and is still very active.
I'll tell him that.
It's none of your business.
I always have trouble pronouncing that word.
I'm glad you're over your cold.
I slept well.
Take three steps and jump.
I'm always under stress.
"If you eat that much, you'll have a stomachache."
The weather was perfect yesterday.
I finished doing the work before supper.
Were you both here yesterday?
It is necessary that every member observe these rules.
Tom is scrubbing the floor.
Tom bumped into Mary the other day at the supermarket.
Tom has been living in Australia since October.
Tom tickled the baby's feet.
"If the rain stops, I may go out."
Tom must be depressed.
What he said was not true.
I think you should take a break.
I asked my teacher what to do next.
"Wouldn't you like to come with us, too?"
"Can you gift-wrap this, please?"
Violent clashes broke out between the protesters and the police.
There's nothing wrong.
Where did I put the keys?
Tom talked.
He's a bit of a drunkard.
I was invited by an old friend.
She has a cheerful personality.
I hit the gym two or three times a week.
Close the door after you when you leave the room.
I don't agree with you.
I shouldn't have done it.
There used to be a big pond around here.
Tom certainly sounds like he comes from a rich family.
You came at just the right time.
The weather was getting worse and worse.
I put a new handle to the door.
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
I don't mind what people say.
It's close to ten o'clock. It's about time we went to bed.
Let's play it by ear.
The interior of the house was very attractive.
I forgot to wear my socks.
"The man who was smoking said, ""He doesn't come here any more."""
It's a small world.
I'm a member of the baseball team.
You look funny in that hat.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
Do you accept credit cards?
"I'm old, but I'm not that old."
Wood can be made into all sorts of things.
He has a dog.
Get away from that door.
Who ate all the candy?
I like these trousers.
We have a long ways to go.
Let's all get along.
I forgot I was in Australia.
I arrived there too early.
Hope you had a good birthday.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
Where's the nearest shopping mall?
I come from the future.
The crops were badly damaged by the storm.
Is there a supermarket nearby?
Tom might be depressed.
Don't let Tom talk to anyone.
I intend to carry out this plan.
It's time to leave.
They waited for him for hours.
I have a cough.
Did you go to the doctor?
Tom watched television yesterday.
Tom can go there if he wants to.
I'm here.
The law is the law.
What're you doing here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
This is the very best method.
I broke my arm when I was a child.
Is Tom better at speaking French or speaking English?
I'd do anything to help you both.
That pianist is known for his technique.
The little kids were very curious.
Are you in there?
He passed away yesterday.
Do Tom and Mary still live here?
He bought her a sweater.
That song reminds me of a certain girl.
How many eggs are there in the refrigerator?
My daughter will get married in June.
I forgot to call you.
Driving too fast is dangerous.
Stop calling me Tom.
She is kind to old people.
The trip was really long.
Why don't you give up smoking?
I'd like it in a brighter color.
One of my dreams is to one day see the aurora borealis.
Are you still homesick?
May I come to see you this afternoon?
Is Tom coming back?
What language do you usually use when talking with Tom?
I'd better go look for her.
It never occurred to me that she loved me.
You may stay here as long as you like.
Let's hurry up.
I don't really know why.
This water tastes strange.
I'm happy for you.
Tom wasn't surprised by this.
Where were you?
Tom's great-great-grandfather grew up in the same town as Mary's great-great-grandmother.
I can't get over my cold.
Let's go to the beach.
It's too hot to work.
Ask any woman.
"There is little, if any, hope of his being alive."
Have you ever wondered how many stars are in the sky?
Divorce rates might reach a plateau soon.
Where is your house?
I hope Tom gets well soon.
Wait a moment.
He's now on the phone.
Is the zoo walking distance from here?
You'd better go to see your family doctor at once.
You're not to blame for the accident.
He is as tall as her.
They adapted themselves to the change quickly.
I told you not to tell anyone.
I say this from my own experience.
The man standing over there is the owner of the store.
Why did you break up?
The parents succeeded in calming him down.
He came home late last night.
This zipper doesn't zip smoothly.
I think Tom doesn't want to tell us the truth.
Are you twins?
I understand how to solve the problem.
I must have it shortened.
Our mother bought a puppy for us.
No one came to the party.
A young child has a small vocabulary.
Beer is brewed from malt.
I wish that I could speak French more fluently.
I'm not a hypocrite.
Airplanes enable people to travel great distances rapidly.
Tom is late.
I cut my right hand on a piece of glass.
I don't know what that thing is.
The street is very narrow.
What would you do if you saw a man from another planet?
"I'm going to be on that train, too."
Why are you wearing a mask?
Why did Tom and Mary get divorced?
I am looking for a present for my mother.
How did you get those bruises on your legs?
We'd better leave her alone.
"In those days, few people could travel abroad."
My daughter lives with me.
She looks unhappy.
I washed my own shirt.
He fell into the cesspool and got covered from head to toe.
He is hard up for money.
Are you free on Monday afternoon?
They started working right away.
The question is which to choose.
The ship's captain ordered the radio operator to send a distress signal.
Tom was about to leave when Mary knocked on the door.
He is tired of reading.
"You like girls, don't you?"
My head aches.
Tom was so busy.
"Having a slight cold, I went to bed early."
What did he do today?
I'll try harder next time.
"No matter what happens, I'll stand by you."
Please sit at the table.
Tom looked relieved.
Is it true Tom and Mary got arrested?
Don't let him touch it.
"I'm very sorry, but I can't."
I guess we're out of luck.
Tom can only speak a little French.
Most people are right-handed.
Is it hot?
Is that a real tattoo?
When will you go to Boston?
Tom and Mary were walking side by side.
I could not afford to buy a bicycle.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
Our dog will bite strangers.
He's too fat.
Another problem has come up.
I had my watch repaired at the store.
Tom is my buddy.
Tom looked like he was bored.
She doesn't know how to drive a car.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
What's the matter?
Are you still living with your parents?
Skip the ad.
Tom thinks he can trust Mary not to do something stupid.
Tom understood.
I wonder whether to write or phone.
He stayed there a couple of days.
Our living room is sunny.
I always wanted to go there.
Let's be friends forever.
Why's Tom wearing a mask?
I spoke loudly so that everyone could hear me.
Would you like to go on a date?
She is very attentive to her grandmother.
It's a violet.
Do you want to be friends?
The forest fell silent again.
I can't do my job without a computer.
Italian pasta is delicious.
I'm going to the library to study.
"Even when I was a child, I was able to swim well."
Teachers must understand children.
Three babies crying incessantly gave me a headache.
The hotel is at the foot of a mountain.
She was busy doing her hair.
Please get in.
It's been a long time since I had such a pleasant surprise.
That's fine with me.
"If I can come again tomorrow, I will."
Is it too late?
I asked Mary what she wanted to do.
When was the last time we talked?
I went to the supermarket.
Do you have a cheaper room?
Get real!
The park is empty.
Everyone says that.
I couldn't catch the train.
You should tell the truth.
Happy New Year. I'm looking forward to working with you again this year.
This gate needs painting.
Your keyboard is filthy.
Stop being cranky.
How many are left?
I'm living in the city.
I'm very serious about wanting to be a good magician.
"You like English, don't you?"
Give me a toothpick.
Please bring me a newspaper.
"Even at half price, these clothes seem expensive."
I hate riddles.
There's more to this than meets the eye.
My father is too busy to take a walk.
I wanted to die.
Let's meet at one o'clock.
Tom lived in a small fishing village.
It's hard to estimate the distance.
Have you ever kissed another guy?
I should never have gotten married.
The train has already gone.
Why didn't you come to school yesterday?
I wasn't surprised to see Tom at the concert.
Tom made up his mind to be a firefighter.
I opened an account in my daughter's name.
Wake up.
"I thought you might be lonely, so I came over with a bottle of wine."
His failure was due to his idleness.
How do you use this camera?
It is said that smoking is bad for your health.
I'm worn out.
Fresh vegetables promote health.
This is what my mother gave me when I got married.
The old woman climbed the stairs with difficulty.
We met in Boston.
The path between the two houses was blocked by snow.
You may join if you are 13 or older.
The cold weather extended into April.
His house is not far from here.
I don't want to do this alone.
It's all right with me.
I felt like I was going to throw up.
There aren't any restaurants around here.
I was banking on him to help me.
Please pass me the butter.
Do that right away.
It was a strange experience.
Turn the radio on.
How did you get Tom to laugh?
Will you send someone to fix it as soon as possible?
Tom is jumping rope.
He lives in a port town.
This purse is made of paper.
Was Tom the one who taught you how to ski?
Please call in a doctor.
I could tell by the look on Tom's face that he knew what was going on.
Tom is no longer living in Boston.
It's a rental car.
A fire broke out in a hotel in our neighborhood.
Can I see you for a sec?
Our problems are nothing compared to his.
This meat is really tender.
Tom showed us how to do it.
He is having lunch.
All of us were busy cleaning the room.
Tom left a large fortune to his son.
Don't sugarcoat it.
I knew you had a girlfriend.
Let's sing together.
Just say yes.
It's copyrighted.
It seems Tom knows that Mary did that.
That's too expensive for me. Can you lower the price a bit?
I look up at the sky.
I am a Japanese.
"Hurry up, or you'll miss your plane."
May I ask you something personal?
"Mama, is it okay if I go swimming?"
Tom has been secretly in love with Mary for a long time.
I don't like that singer.
There will be a dance Friday night at the high school.
"When I go to see my grandson, I always give him a present."
"The room was completely dark, so we couldn't see anything."
I always go to school on foot.
You'll be allowed to use this room tomorrow.
He can't afford a new car.
Tom glanced at his watch.
Let's wait till he comes.
What did you go there for?
I can't pronounce this word.
I'm a little busy.
A cat got out from under the car.
The lawyer brought up new evidence.
Have you finished your homework?
I'm looking forward to your letter.
Coffee keeps me awake.
She has never sung a song with him.
That won't succeed.
I heard a child's voice.
"I go for a walk every day, except when it rains."
I really don't understand French.
He was refused medical treatment.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
May I pay with a credit card?
Tom knows the city like the back of his hand.
She froze at the sight of the bear.
I'm not a child any longer.
Where are your glasses?
That toy is made out of wood.
Are Tom and Mary getting along?
Please excuse my being late.
I slept only two hours.
"Don't tell the others, OK?"
Tom has a peanut allergy.
No problem.
I'll eat it here.
We must begin before five.
He can run faster than I can.
Tom heard Mary practicing her violin.
"If you were forced to sign that contract, then it's invalid."
You should wash your hands before eating.
Your door isn't closed.
Everyone is in a bad mood.
"We are friends, aren't we?"
I was tired of waiting.
I'll stay right here until you get back.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I'm uneasy about donating blood.
There used to be a house here.
I got very sleepy.
My parents live outside the city.
Turn right at the first traffic light.
Are you having fun?
I've enjoyed good health all my life.
Brazil is a large country.
Have you found Tom?
Tom's uncle keeps a lot of sheep.
"Now, that looks yummy. I'd like to try it."
There are many old temples in Kyoto.
I'm getting little pimples on my face. I wonder if I've been getting enough sleep lately.
I helped my father yesterday.
The situation could only be settled by war.
A beautiful lake lay just beyond the forest.
It's hard to believe Tom really wants to go to Boston.
"When I opened the window, it got a bit cooler."
Where's the proof that he committed a crime?
I bought a round-trip ticket.
Turn on the light.
I'm a government worker.
I'm speechless.
It might be easier than you think.
I found the rope ladder.
"Excuse me, where's the bathroom?"
Where's the boss?
"Even if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money."
Both Tom and Mary should've known better.
"You don't have to apologize, Tom."
You're looking good.
She was so angry that she could not speak.
"To tell the truth, I felt lonely."
The baby fell asleep in the cradle.
Are you going to have dinner at home?
My dog eats better meat than me.
Let's compare the translation with the original.
I've already eaten my lunch.
I hear that he's very rich.
I gave the map to Tom.
"In Japan, it's three in the morning now."
Show me another camera.
Cheer up!
It was fun talking to you.
I thought he might come.
Why aren't you wearing your shades?
I haven't decided which job to apply for.
It's raining hard.
"On crowded buses, young people should give their seats to old people."
Speaking foreign languages is not easy.
You seem to like fruit.
The natives of the North-West Pacific Coast of America were probably descendants of tribes from Asia.
Feel free to contact me.
There are still people who believe the earth is flat.
Stay home so you can answer the phone
There's no chance that he'll recover.
"If I'd worked hard when I was young, I'd be successful now."
This woman definitely knows that she doesn't know what she wants.
Is this your bike?
She ran across her old friend while walking in the park.
I don't know where they are.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
Now is the time for action.
Let's do that next Monday.
I think I'll make it.
Do you really care why I quit smoking?
"The room is dirty, so I'll clean it."
I'll come right away.
"Since Tom is honest, I like him."
He assumed full responsibility for it.
"Mom, the kettle is boiling."
The pain is gone.
I haven't had anything to eat since yesterday.
I thought it went OK.
How many languages do you speak?
Jump!
I really want to be a good teacher.
What's this smell?
Take whichever you want.
I have a slight headache today.
My real name is Tom Jackson.
I'm invited to this party.
I gave my mother a birthday present.
Don't give up hope.
Those snakes are extremely dangerous.
Where do you plan to go for your vacation?
I wanted a jacket.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji.
Can you do this problem?
Murders are very common in big cities.
Tom has insomnia.
Mastering a foreign language calls for patience.
I'll stand guard now. Go get some sleep.
Our problems are nothing compared to his.
I don't know that.
Who's the naughty boy that broke the window?
Who's eaten the cheese?
The weatherman says that it'll rain in the afternoon.
The group departed as soon as he arrived.
Do you know this man?
I want to sleep.
I'll get you something to drink.
The operation was a success.
I'd never lie to Tom.
Why did you show Tom that?
"Don't work too much, OK?"
I am expecting a letter from her.
She has no brothers.
"I'm sorry, but I am against this project."
I'll go out and buy one as soon as I can.
I know his address.
I think we could be good friends.
I have a picture of the airport.
"He came back not because he was homesick, but because he was running short of money."
What color was the phlegm that you coughed up?
I think Tom is still homesick.
Tom's design is very original.
It is difficult to play the piano.
"I'll help you, of course."
The stake that sticks out gets hammered down.
We will make it public.
I do hope you'll come again.
I bought a camera not long ago.
Man is the only animal that can make use of fire.
Who do you usually eat lunch with?
Will we be in time for the train?
Tom is a skydiving instructor.
I'll see you two later.
Tom lives here in Australia.
I'll follow your advice.
He seems quite happy.
Can I do it again?
It isn't a bug. It's an undocumented feature.
The people groaned under the burden of heavy taxation.
It doesn't cost anything.
Close your books.
She's my professor.
My brother soon got used to living alone in Tokyo.
Can you give me a brief description of the thief?
The money will probably be split evenly between those two.
Are you free tonight?
"Upon arriving home, he immediately set about preparing a meal."
I studied English for four years with a native speaker.
Tom's not asleep.
You have to be home by nine o'clock.
We're both thirteen years old.
This size doesn't fit.
I'll take a glass of champagne.
"She likes jazz, and so do I."
His nerve failed him at the last moment.
Tom had no choice but to support Mary.
Will you eat a little cake?
Tom was the one who took these pictures.
The scenery around here is very beautiful.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
"Where I live, we have snow in January."
Tom translated a French novel into English.
I'll be right back.
I got a shave and a haircut.
Please stop it.
I sat on the sofa.
Has that secretarial position been filled?
Does Tom think that he can do it?
I'm not the least bit worried about it.
You're welcome to do anything you like.
It's not my problem.
She pointed her finger at him accusingly.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
"It feels wrong, doesn't it?"
School begins at eight-thirty.
I don't like the smell of garlic.
Is this also yours?
My mother is preparing lunch.
"Easy come, easy go."
It's Tom's turn to talk.
He may be a good man for all I know.
The people next door were annoyed with us for making so much noise last night.
This is a real popular item.
Please don't worry about that.
I want to see Tom.
I met my teacher on the street the other day.
Tom shouted.
Tom was sitting alone in the cafeteria.
Please come again.
This is the latest fashion this spring.
You should keep an eye on Tom.
My wife is always finding fault with me.
My uncle gave his car to me.
I don't want to become a doctor.
I'm looking for a simpler solution.
Tom was a model inmate.
Please come next Friday.
This shirt is a little bit large.
Study in the cool of the morning.
Tom solved the problem on his own.
I'm brave.
It isn't as cold here as in Alaska.
This is the best book that I've ever read.
Tom has been living out of a suitcase for the past two months.
It's necessary to take correct measurements when you are tailoring a suit.
I started working as soon as I graduated from college.
Don't call him Tom.
He advised me not to believe what she says.
We actually didn't see the accident.
Never tell a lie again.
It's yours.
I have expected his death for six months.
"I couldn't buy a red coat, so I bought a blue one."
"How nice to see you again, Tom."
Is there anyone in the room?
You can sit anywhere you like.
Fire devoured the forest.
Where is your school?
Hello.
I promise that I'll mop the floor tomorrow morning.
Don't worry about Tom. He isn't a threat.
The sky cleared up soon after the storm.
Thank you for the lead.
I'm not the only one who thinks Tom is overweight.
Tom took Mary's suitcase out of the trunk.
Tom is a sociopath.
Are you for or against this?
I could swim across the river when I was twelve.
He is such a tidy person. Every pot and pan is in its place.
I ran into the house because it started to rain.
I caught him cheating in the examination.
Don't bother to pick me up at the hotel.
I think that this sweater will look good on you.
She cared for the children after the death of their mother.
Many students live in the suburbs of the city.
I'd like meatloaf.
He is far from perfect.
Tom isn't good at sports.
Turn the flame down low.
Tom often plays the guitar.
Let's be friends.
Can you speak French?
Tell him to come here at once.
I want to eat pizza tonight.
Tom left through the back door.
It's been raining since last Saturday.
"This is your hat, isn't it?"
There are pretty flowers in the garden.
Tom picked the book off the floor.
I was having a bath when the telephone rang.
The school is on the hill.
I'm glad to hear that she is unmarried.
It's beyond me.
Have it your way.
Tom has just returned to Boston.
I was laughed at in school today.
I'm behind and exams are coming up.
Are you afraid of being fired?
I never dreamed that you would lose.
I'll take an impression of your teeth.
A travel agent arranged everything for our trip.
Better late than never.
I usually go to bed before ten o'clock.
I have to take care of my mother.
I'd like to be a French teacher.
I'm afraid that I can't do that.
I think she was planning on going to visit her mother in the hospital.
I'd like to pick you up now.
I dreamt I was driving drunk.
Do you see anything?
Would you please put out your cigarette?
Would you like some more cake?
Both of my parents were brought up in the country.
I wish that I'd seen the movie.
I saw the boxing match on television.
Don't you wash your hands before meals?

We have lots of time.
Which bicycle do you like more?

English is easy to learn.
May I take a picture of you?

Roll up your sleeves and get to work.
Tom wasn't the one who gave Mary that necklace.
Do you want me to help you wash the dishes?
My daughter is to get married in June.
Your hair's so smooth and pretty. What kind of shampoo do you use?
What are you guys looking at?
My favorite color is green.
They say that he's very rich.
You can stay here as long as you don't make any noise.
There are stores along the street.
Even Tom is surprised that Mary lied.
She's rolling in money.
It'll be forgotten in a few months' time.
They enjoyed themselves at the party.
Let me have a cigarette.
I bought Tom a sweater.
The tour bus has crossed the border.
What types of movies make you cry?

I suddenly thought of my dead mother.
Whales are very large mammals that live in the sea.
The shirts are still damp.
I also put my pens in the drawer.
Do you think so?
You never talk about your wife.
"You don't need to apologize, Tom."
I've already finished my homework.
This question is too difficult for me.
I walked about aimlessly on the street.
If only I had known the answer yesterday!
Please come to the lobby by 7 o'clock.
Could you give me a wake-up call at seven?
Tom gets up early.
Tom and I played tennis all morning.
I still love her.
It's your turn to speak.
What do you call that bird in French?
She kept working.
I don't like him coming to my house so often.
Does that name ring a bell?

What did Tom do?
You look very tired.
I saw it with my own two eyes.
They appealed to us for help.
It looks like an apple.
Will you mail this letter for me?
I'll take care of it.
Tom may come at any time.
"Well, see you later."
I shave almost every day.
Tom buttered a slice of bread.
Mary has beautiful brown eyes.
It snowed here today.
Are you employed here?
You need to restart your computer.
Please come here.
Couldn't you just do it later?
It isn't hard.
Can you picture it?
I thought that I was going to get caught by the police.
There used to be a hotel around here.
So what are you implying?
"When I have homework to do, my brother always helps me with it."
He was cleaning his room.
Only fifty people came.
"He went there, never to return."
The wave knocked me off my feet.
I saw you driving your new car.
This is the place where my father was born.
Do you have an extra one?
It's a great pleasure to be here.
You're worrying too much.
Talk to me!
It seems that he's happy.
Was Tom working alone?
Tom isn't mad.
Shame on you!
Let's live it up!
I finally contacted him by phone.
Coffee and chocolate go well together.
"Finally, Tom achieved his goal."
I think that Tom is thirty.

"You came by train, right?"
What's the phone number of the pizza place?

I asked him not to drive so fast.
I always wanted to go there.
I intend to phone Tom tomorrow and ask him to help.
This book is too difficult for you to read.
What color is your hair?
"If it hurts, raise your hand."
We need more beer.
Please give me batteries for a camera.
I asked Tom if we could meet.
It kept raining all day long.
Teach me how you do it.
The desk is covered with dust.
Thank you for your advice.
Tom is a kid.
Use a calculator.

I think you ought to listen.
She appears to have a lot of friends.
I got off the bus at the end of the line.
That's surprising.

I hate working late.
Tom is worried about what might have happened to Mary.
"To tell the truth, I used to smoke two packs a day."
"Close the door, please."

I drank water.
Are you sure that Tom is here?
I have been associated with him for ten years.
You need to sleep.
Nobody knows why.
You can do better on your tests.

I really do hate that.
"I thought doing this would be easy, but we've been working all day and we're still not finished."
My mother bought me a nice dress last Sunday.
I met him about noon.
I can't remember the melody to that song.
He used to love her.
How many rooms do you have?
He told his brother the story.
Tom has a weak stomach.
It is risky for you to go into that area alone.
What do you plan to do after you retire?
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
Tom jumped into the swimming pool.
Tom's dream as a child was to become a veterinarian.
He was hard up.
I love you.
This door leads to the study.
Tom is dancing.
I'll return to Australia the day after tomorrow.
Tom showed the police officer his driver's license.
I gathered from what she said that she liked him.
The best bet on a rainy day is to remain indoors.
He let me stay for a night.
That tree has many oranges on it.
Peel the apples.
He was running and calling for help.
I bought this in Boston three weeks ago.
"When spring comes, they plow the fields and plant seeds."
He is about my size.
Are all of them ready?
"Can you pass me the salt, please?"
I want you to return to your seat.
We're on our way home.
Have you ever heard her play the piano?
They saw a strange animal there.
It has snowed a bit.

Try to laugh a little.

I have breakfast every morning.
Tom never talks about money.
Tom is an electrical engineer.
I have visited Boston three times.

Don't push.
How is your project progressing?
The lemon is a sour fruit.
The water is clear to the bottom.
The bus arrived ten minutes late.
I hope to hear from you.
Tom pointed towards the mountain.
I just have a couple of questions.
I thought that it was an earthquake.
The other day you said you lost your umbrella. Did you ever find it?
I did it for you.
Most people don't realize this.
I bought some new furniture.
I insist on your being present.
My bicycle is newer than yours.
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.
I have been to the station to see him off.
You ought to do that immediately.
That sounds like a scam.
He's afraid of the dog.
I ordered two hamburgers.
What I told you about him also applies to his brother.
The bank opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 3 p.m.
"I'd like some cider, please."
"To get a prescription, go to a doctor."
"I'd like to stay and chat, but I've got a meeting to go to."
"The check, please."
Good results are expected.
The paperwork was legible.
I met Tom tonight.
Why didn't you come?
We were just having lunch.
I was very upset.
There's one thing I don't understand.
Dead men tell no tales.
That movie was really funny.
I know that Tom is shorter than me.
Tom told me where I could buy pomegranates.
My brother takes care of our dog.
I soon learned how to swim.
We talked about the plan with him.

Tom said he thought that he had forgotten something.
I was able to answer all the questions.
You left the iron on.
He is studying hard so that he can pass the examinations.
He laid on his back and looked up at the sky.
Many students were present at the lecture.
We study many subjects in high school.
The bus was filled to capacity.
A rat chewed a hole in the wall.
I was born and raised in Boston.
My house faces the sea.
Your shirt button is coming off.
I like learning ancient languages.
He ought to have arrived there by now.
Remove your hat.
He died recently.
You'd better not go out in this cold weather.
Do whatever you want.
Remove your shirt and lie down.
I have a different opinion on that subject.
I like autumn best.
"Girls begin puberty around the ages of ten to eleven, and boys around the ages of eleven to twelve."
Can I try these shoes on?
I'm going to take the 10:30 train.
Give that to him.
Do you think that it'll rain this weekend?
The exam wasn't hard.
You're not allowed to park around here.
Tom took a shower and went to bed.
The clothes are wet.
Help me.
I can't express my feelings in French.
Your pen is better than mine.
I'll try harder next time.
Tom made spaghetti.
Tom tried to open the door.
He had no difficulty in finding the place.
My daughter often had asthma attacks when she was a child.
Did you play football in college?
He gave me a good piece of advice.
I have a great deal to do today.
How did this happen?
That isn't your fault.
Will you be competing with Tom?
I'm staying at that hotel.
Tom got soaked to the skin and caught a cold.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
Tom knows better than to fight with you.
What's the commotion?
Does anyone on your team speak French?
You're a kind man.
We aided him with money.
"When I was thirteen years old, I couldn't speak French at all."
Is that the map that Tom gave you?
He has a cold now.
I barely managed to finish the letter by eleven o'clock.
Why do you say that?

Tom can't speak French.
I'm accustomed to staying up late.
Those two children were the same age.
They know how to swim.
Is Tom dependable?
He's talking on the telephone.
I have to walk to the post office.
Even a clock that is stopped shows the correct time twice a day.
Did you call?
What have you been doing all this while?
I don't see any difference.
My pack is very heavy.
Tom helps me in French.
Why do I need to learn French?
Today is hotter than yesterday.
I can't help suspecting that he is lying.
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
This is all I can do for now.
"My mother said if I eloped, she would never forgive me."
He felt very lonely.
"Since I had a cold, I stayed at home."
I meet Tom once every three months.
Are you sure that Tom doesn't like Mary?
Mary and Alice are both expecting.
He is now on his own.
Nobody likes being laughed at.
It is more than I can stand.
I'm going out now.
I love kittens and puppies.
I really enjoyed myself at the party.
I just didn't believe what Tom said.
This is no time for modesty.
Tom lied to us again.
How's the player that got hurt?
I had some engine trouble yesterday.
I can't meet Tom.
You should eat more.
"If you eat nothing but ice cream, you'll get a stomachache."
Quick. Look outside!
Tom keeps a spare key hidden in his garden.
Tom said goodbye and got on the subway.
Let's drink.
Did I leave the water running?
It has been ten years since I left Japan.
I go to school by bus.
The plane flew out of sight.
Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena.
I ran as quickly as I could.
That house is haunted by Tom's ghost.
Have you seen my keys?
They'll give in to us some day.
Keep off the grass.
Your wish will come true in the near future.
I'm saving money for my old age.
It would be better if you didn't climb such a high mountain in the winter.
I have great difficulty in handling the child.
Her voice trembled with rage.
We couldn't row against the strong current.
I take my hat off to him for his hard work.
I've bought some freshly baked bread.
"Did Tom, by any chance, let Mary drive the car?"
She is a selfish woman.
"The date on the document was October 20, 2013."
I could tell right away it was you.
I have a small fever.
Don't you swim?
"Suddenly, my mother started singing."
I thought that I smelled bacon.
Shall I cook dinner today?
He always puts himself first.
We have a French exam on Monday.
He's crazy about baseball.
Was Tom telling the truth?
Tom always wears black clothes.
She scolded him for being late.
I didn't catch the meaning.
Do you and Tom argue often?
We thought he was an American.
Tom burst out crying.
Tell me what you saw.
I caught a carp in a net.
They advertised a new car on TV.
Take your shoes off before entering a temple.
Please call the fire department.

Send me a postcard.
That guy's weird.
I have not yet finished my supper.
Tom is a stingy guy.
Don't read my diary.
I am too tired to run.
Tom sat two rows ahead of me.
There was only one small problem.
I'm only thirteen.
You're old enough to know better.
Tom arrived late at the station.
I have more experience than Tom.
I forgot there was a test today.
My mouth's already watering.
Tom has finally found a job.
I sleep on my side.
Autumn begins in October.
I'm pleased to meet you.
She has the air of being a lady.
I like reading.
Write something.
Read this book.
Japanese young people like rock and jazz.
This morning's low temperature was -1 degree. The temperature will only go up to 7 degrees during the day. Please dress warmly when you go out.
Are you able to speak French?
"If I start eating potato chips, I can't stop."
I hate these words.
I'm very hungry.
I made plans.
I would rather you came on Friday than on Thursday.
Tom used to wear a wig.
This is too expensive.
You were wise not to follow his advice.
I'll make dinner.
A square has four equal sides.
Half of the students are absent.
Send me somebody right away.
Why do you give Tom money?
Tom doesn't love Mary anymore.
This is really good.
Now is the time for action.
Don't let him do it alone.
Never tell a lie.
She wore a beautiful dress.
Do they sell bread at that store?
I ran into a tree.
Tom is in the shower.
Call off your dogs.
Do you know how to drive a car?
"The next year, World War I broke out."
"He said, ""It's nine o'clock."""
A river runs through the valley.
I bet you can't do that.
"You did that without anyone's help, didn't you?"
Everybody knows it.
He built a new house.
It may or may not be true.
Is it OK if I use your phone?
I think Mary looks better without makeup.
Let me stay a little longer.
Tom called a taxi for Mary.
What I'm holding in my hand is a book.
There was a fire in this city last night.
There was a sudden change in the situation.
"Sorry, I'm 30 minutes late because I overslept."

We're playing tennis this weekend.
When did you start playing golf?
Koalas sleep for 18 to 22 hours per day.
It sounds to me as if he has something to do with the matter.
Let's pretend that nothing happened?
I'd rather die than marry that kind of person.
I love movies.
We'll make a restroom stop at the next gas station.
This should relieve the pain.
I have things to do tomorrow.
My computer won't boot up.
He tossed and turned all night.
When and where shall we meet?
Don't tell anyone that I wet the bed.
Hang onto Daddy!
He is a bad driver.
I'm planning on staying for two nights.
Have you already finished your homework?
Thank you for your reply.
I really like studying languages.
It's very easy to use.
Nobody thinks Tom will win the race.
I haven't checked my email yet.
Do you have the book?
He wants to meet you.
We need accommodation for six.
Are you in a rush?
What are you going to tell Tom exactly?
Doesn't it work?
Do you live alone?
Tom put on his coat and went out.
I meet Tom every day.

Tom lives in Boston with his grandparents.
It's not easy to come by watermelons at this time of year.

You're wasting your time.
Tom is from Australia.
We got lost in the woods.
I'm not at all interested.
Tom translated the text into French.

My life is empty without you.

I didn't know that you had a cat.
The soccer game is tomorrow.
I really hate job hunting.
What train you are going to take?
I've decided to become a writer.
It's unbelievable.
There is very little probability of an agreement being reached.
Why don't we ask his advice?

The only one we have is this one here.

Can I rest a bit?
I hate this part of the movie.
How many times will you have to go to the dentist?
I am dying for a cold drink.
Let's wait until Tom gets back.
How did it come about?
You'd better see a doctor and get a shot.
Mary is the only woman that I've ever really loved.
Nothing is more important than health.
A rose smells sweet.
Were you alone the whole week?
I want to make new friends.
My uncle was involved in the traffic accident.
Let's get things ready beforehand.
Did you enjoy the movies?
Would you lend me your knife?

He's a good man for the job.
That was really boring.
I don't have a smartphone yet.
Wait here till I return.
I was in New York for a few days.
He signaled them to stop.
London is small compared to Tokyo.
Can we stay here?
A dog suddenly jumped at me.
The snow prevented us from arriving on time.
Land prices are very high in Japan.
The dog wants to come in.
Are you through yet?
"Would you mind helping me with my work? ""Not at all."""
Tom was in a meeting all day.
"Seen from a distance, this mountain looks like Mt. Fuji."
I'm pretty sure nobody's going to recognize you.

"I'm sorry, but I don't feel like going out today."
He disposed of the trash.

Is there enough wind for sailing?
Where've you been?
Tom loves animals.
She kept me waiting for 30 minutes.
I'm looking for the person who did this.
The store closes at eleven.
Tom didn't read the newspaper yesterday.
A novel idea occurred to me.
He came back home three days later.
A lot of people attended Tom's funeral.
Are you single?
What are you searching for?
I have something in my eye.
"Hey, is everything going well?"
She showed me a picture of her mother as a schoolgirl.
There are many advantages.
The problem is not so much the cost as the time.
There are people who seldom speak unless they're spoken to.
I was amazed that she had drunk all of the wine.
Come here.
Did we win?
It cost me ten thousand yen to have my television set repaired.
"I used to think that only bears hibernate, but the teacher said that turtles do as well."

Please put your thumbprint here.
I studied really hard in order to pass the exam.
All hope of winning the game vanished.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom tried to think of something that would help.
You should've been more careful.
Both Tom and Mary got rich.
Tom can also speak French.
I have a 13-year-old son.
Were you at home at ten o'clock?
"Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake, said the shy young man."
Tom pushed Mary off the edge of the cliff.
I'm actually enjoying myself.
Tom thinks he's better than other people.
That's enough for today.
You broke the rule.
Did Tom ask you to do it?
I don't have to go to the doctor any more. I'm feeling much better.
I wonder why Tom is studying French.
We tried to cheer him up by taking him out.
I thought Tom had gotten over Mary.
Do you have any colored pencils?
Start running.
Choose either one or the other.
Are you scared of Tom?
I wonder if anything happened to him.
I know him by name.
They declined our invitation.
Tom doesn't drink cold tea.
The math homework proved to be easier than I had expected.
How does that song go?
Have you ever gone camping?
The chimney needs to be cleaned.
Her beauty was beyond description.
We celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary yesterday.
This sentence seems to be grammatically correct.
I saw a dog.
You and I think alike.
Tom tossed a coin into the fountain.
He took a week off.
I can hear a saxophone somewhere.
Someone hit me on the back.
Tom switched off the lights.
Today's my day off.
Who's the woman who's talking to Tom?
I want to be successful.
Tom can't remember Mary's address.
"At the age of six, I was taken to a circus for the first time."
"The bank robber shouted, ""Stay where you are, all of you!"""
I worried about that.
She stared at me.
I was born in October.
Look! There's a shooting star.
My father goes to work by bike.
I'm a fast runner.
I've never been spoken to like that.
I want to name my daughter Mary.
Let's take a taxi.
That's the last thing that I expected you to do.
"First, let's have a cup of coffee."
He quit without notice.
Is there someone else?
I'm not used to doing this.
I'd like some more water.
I've been working here since I graduated from college.
Tom isn't a good boy.
"Last night, I fell asleep while talking with Mary on the phone."
My grandfather cannot walk without a stick.
I'll stop by the post office on the way home.
That was a really good call.
The leaves on the trees have begun to change colors.
Tom took a seat.
My father is two years younger than my mother is.
What a relief!
Tom took a stroll.
I don't read this kind of book very often.
I ate a nutritious breakfast.
"Tom has an umbrella, but Mary doesn't."
There's someone I'm concerned about.
What Tom found was shocking.
His son is ill.
Come back in an hour.
There used to be a church here.
Won't you come with us?
May I have a few minutes of your time?
An accident just happened.
Are you sure you turned off the stove?
Do earthquakes happen often in Australia?
Close the door.
You should've learned how to swim when you were young.
I want to buy a new home.
I thought you'd gone to Boston.
Tom folded an origami crane.
Mary kissed my cheek.
Did you learn it from him?
She sent the letter by airmail.
I got up.
Are you sure this is the right place?
Come to my place.
I think you should change your eating habits.
That's what I've been looking for.
"This hall can hold 5,000 people."
All of them wanted to know my secret.
He sent me a birthday card.
One hundred dollars will cover all your expenses for the trip.
I'm worried about the future.
My father was already at home when I came back.
"Happy birthday, Tom."
Eternal love doesn't exist.
I am going to apply for a visa today.
Tom is going to need your help.
I want to go study at a Canadian university.
It's my CD.
I just solved this puzzle.
A man appeared from behind the door.
This is a road map.
I can't shake off my cold.
I have no money.
She unlocked her suitcase.
Please write me a reply soon.
Kyoto is the old capital of Japan.
I don't have anything to do now.
Mary made a cake without her mother's knowledge.
Let me know if you won't be here on time.
He wouldn't let anybody interfere with his private affairs.
He won the election by a large majority.
She was brave.
This new design is definitely better than the previous one.
That's why I don't like Tom.
This one is definitely better.
Let me show you around the town this afternoon.
Maybe I need a lawyer.
I'm not Catholic.
Tom is longing to live in the country.
We must reduce energy demand.
What are you allergic to?
When do you expect him back?
"Recently, I meet with my teacher once a week."
The last three days have been really muggy.
How's your dad?

Tom cycles to work.
I'd like to borrow fifty dollars from you.
Please give him a dose of medicine every six hours.
May I touch this?
Do you want some vodka?
I wonder how Tom will answer Mary's question.
"I'll do it tomorrow. ""You said that yesterday!"""
"Let me see your ticket, please."

Will you go on a picnic with me?
I'll come right now.
"At first, I had difficulty understanding people when they spoke too fast."

I want to pay by credit card.
Thanks for calling.

Come outside with me.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
It is nice to see you again.
How soon will Tom get here?
How much is the tour?
May I ask you a couple of questions?
This flower smells very nice.
I want somebody to love.
"If you were to win the lottery, what would you buy with the money?"
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
I don't speak any French.
Please be quiet.
The problem is that we don't have enough money.
I'm not a kid anymore.
Nobody said that.
We are going to visit our aunt next Sunday.
I'm going to stay here for a couple of days.
I went to bed at twelve last night.
My father planted this tree on the day I was born.

He talked to the chairman.
It has been over three years since I moved here.
Which of your parents do you think you look like?
Why is life so full of suffering?
Tom arrived in a taxi.
I'll call back in twenty minutes.
He often attributes his failures to bad luck.
She's always smiling.
"If I'd been a bird, I could've flown to you."
Do you have the key?
I know the photographer who took this picture.
Let's have a tea party the day after tomorrow.
My father usually leaves home while I am in bed.
I can call Tom if you want.
You are not a child anymore.
What's the good of having a car if you don't drive?
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
Can you open the door for me?
I can't remember the password I used for this website.
Was Tom here?
Many students have failed the test.
They have many friends.
Mary went back to the office.
It's getting dark. I wonder if it's going to rain.
Are you freaking kidding me?!
I respect those who always do their best.
How would you say it in French?
The gate is so narrow that the car can't pass through it.
It's just the right size.
I guess Tom already knows.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
What are we making?
Do you mind opening the door?
I want to get a tourist visa.
I forgot my sandals.
The outraged employee resigned at once.
She is drawing a picture.
This door won't budge.
Were there many people in the library?

Everybody was very happy.
You're driving way too fast.
I slept like a log.
Pride goes before a fall.
Mary isn't really sick. She's faking it.
I don't have any money on me.
Cookbooks sell well.
I want to come back here next year.
The sun sets earlier in the winter.
Who would've thought this would happen?
I like to eat pizza for breakfast.
Tom said that he's never eaten sushi.
I'm getting used to eating alone.
There used to be a small bridge over the river 10 years ago.
You'll soon get used to Japanese food.
Did you just see something?
What Tom said is true.
I need a plate.
Tom often doesn't keep his promises.
I'm having fun.
"Are you interested in baseball, Tom?"
They said it was urgent.
Is there anything else you want to ask?
"Don't pour hot water into a glass, or it may crack."
I should've brought something to eat.
I love French movies.
Thanks for helping me.
Are you friends?
He returned home without telling us.
Colds are prevalent this winter.
I am sorry that my friend is not here.

"I might have to come home late. In that case, I'll phone you."
I want to see the roses.
It was foolish of him to waste his money on such trifles.
I'll come by and pick you up tomorrow morning.

I'm well.
Is it an action movie?

We can't sleep because of the noise.
I want to learn snowboarding.
Enjoy your holidays.
She's already sleeping.
She caught a cold last night.
Tom didn't say anything to Mary about it.
She usually goes to bed at nine.
I'm going out for lunch.
There are a lot of roses in this garden.
She always believes me.
I hope you are all well.

I thought that you might change your mind.
What're you doing?
I spend money as soon as I get it.
My father bought me some books.
Almost all of Tom's free time is spent on a golf course.
I always get nervous just before a match.

Keep in mind that you're not as young as you used to be.

You don't need to lie.
I saw a boy wearing brown shoes.
How safe is Boston?
He remained single all his life.
Thanks to both of you.
The question is whether Tom can do it or not.
I hit on a good idea.
I didn't enjoy it.
I'd like to stay as long as possible.
I want you to return it to me as soon as possible.
Tom is back with his ex-wife.
Charles Lindbergh made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927.
Did it rain yesterday?
"If he should come in my absence, please ask him to wait until I come back."
What was that sound?
I surrender.
Can you answer this riddle?
This dress is a good bargain.
What is that?
Tom didn't know what Mary was thinking.
The pain will go away in no time.
I thought that you knew.
Do you remember the town where he was born?
Do you have a partner?
Why on earth didn't you take your medicine?
Is it close enough to walk there?
Just say yes or no.
May I add a point?
Tom has a sweet tooth.
Tom told me he was really busy.
I saw him enter the room.
We need to band together to beat the enemy.
A lot of people think I'm crazy.
She's wearing a loose coat.
"Even though Tom is rich, he isn't happy."
I fell asleep while studying at my desk.
Stop it.
Tom scolded Mary.
Tom and Mary will be leaving for Australia early tomorrow morning.
We postponed the event.
Won't you speak more slowly?
Do you remember what you were wearing the first time that I met you?
It wasn't supposed to happen.
You know where everything is.
Tell me Tom's email address.
The bike parked over there is my brother's.
I feel sorry for her.
These glasses are beautiful.

This is Uncle Tom's farm.
That won't happen.

Don't put the glass near the edge of the table.
My father helped me with my homework.
My mother comes to stay with us at least once a month.
We watched the soccer game on TV.

Why not talk to her about it directly?
Be still.
I'm sick of eating out every night.
Do whatever he tells you.
We're always going there! Let's go to a French restaurant for a change.
Tom was bullied.
I didn't ask her.
"Even though I was sitting in the sun, I still felt chilly."
What time can you come?
I'm kind of sick today.
She helped the old man across the street.
"Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy."
I have a green shirt.
You may not pass the test.
Please don't misunderstand me.
What is meant by that?
I know where the key is.
Tell me something that I don't know.
Is that a fire truck?
Are you saying that my life is in danger?
There were lots of fireflies.
I have a friend whose father is a magician.
It was sunny and warm.
Please don't worry.
You are fortunate to have such loving parents.
Are you feeling better?
"Tom, would you show Mary how to use the scanner?"
I don't like classical music.
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
I learned to live without her.
Can you stay home alone?
I'd like to get off here.
"You know his name, don't you?"
Who cares?
There are some things you can say and some things you can't.
The flower pot crashed to the sidewalk.
I'll come as soon as possible.
The rain has already stopped.
Can you please repeat what you just said?
Tom turned the lights off.
I can't find my nail clippers.
I wish I'd brought my computer.
This kind of mushroom is poisonous.
My mother was disappointed by my failure.
I resemble my mother.
We had enough money to buy the things we needed.

Lots of old people are killed in traffic accidents every year.
You should have come earlier.
Were all of your children born in Boston?
This is one of the best places to eat in town.
Do you like to travel?
I don't ever want to see you again.
"Tom wrote Mary a long letter, but he didn't send it to her."
"No, thank you. I'm just looking."
He made his way to the room.
Today was fun.
Can dogs eat bananas?
How about your place?
Let me introduce my parents to you.
He showed what he meant.
I think that Tom is self-centered.
Please show me something cheaper.
Ask Tom what he thinks of Boston.
I had a good time at the party.
I have no idea what time it is.
It's a difficult problem.
I was planning to leave immediately.
I'm eating out this evening.
My hair was still wet from being washed.
I've been sluggish recently.
There used to be a big cherry tree behind my house.
I remember the house where I grew up.
You talk really fast.
Why don't you give your seat to that old gentleman?
Mary is going to get herself killed if she's not careful.
How was your birthday?
I can't do this.
It's a ten-minute walk to school.
I hate making people wait.
She gave birth to twins.
He sometimes loses hope.
"I'm sorry, but I don't have any small change."
I wish I could.
He knew she had been busy since morning.
"It won't happen again, I promise."
She's not coming back.

I would rather throw the money away than give it to him.

I want a car that runs on solar power.
Why's it so expensive?
I was planning on doing that alone.
I was tired.
Get out of the way.
Do you mind if I wait here?
I'm still single.
"Which do you like better, apples or oranges?"
Humor Tom.
"In other words, she became a good wife."
I turned the radio off.
Let me hear it.
He is a bad boy.
I've got strawberries. Would you like some?
What exactly are you trying to say?
Tom and Mary are waiting for us.
"Which do you want, tea or coffee?"
Do not oversleep tomorrow morning.
I got to the station this morning.
I didn't want to split up with Mary.
What made you say such a stupid thing as that?

Draw a line on the paper.

What would you like to do?
The number of students who were late for school was much smaller than I had expected.
My legs are still shaking.
Where is the restroom?
Tom is fast.
"I am going to my room, where I can study."
There is a bus every fifteen minutes.
That can't be true.
There's a little water in the bucket.
Even a child can answer it.
She may be French.
Those are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
We expect a very cold winter this year.
Tom should have his eyes examined.
I hate it when women say that all men are the same.
I see.
What do you want to ask me?
We caught a large one there.
I think that Tom is mistaken.
Our visit has been very pleasant.
The steam has fogged my glasses.
I crossed the river by boat.
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

This is what we want to know.
This watch is twice as expensive as that one.
We have enough water.
Tom is in the house.
I don't know yet.
I have nothing to do with that.
I don't know if I have enough time or not.
"Long time, no see."
Time will tell which is right.
This is a book.
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
Nothing is the matter with the car. It's just that you are a bad driver.

I didn't apologize.
Why do you want to be a doctor?

All you have to do is wait until dark.
I normally don't do things like this.
Do you have any foreign stamps?
Tom grabbed the letter out of Mary's hand.
Let's play baseball with everyone.

He can't do it.
I'd prefer not to do that here.
Where does this book go?
He took his sister along.
These colors don't match well.
We swam in the lake.
Tom thinks Mary doesn't get enough sleep.
I'm sick of listening to her complaints.
It's ten o'clock sharp.
Tom does the dishes every night.
"Why? ""I do not know why."""

"Even with all his wealth and fame, he's unhappy."
I was walking in the park with a friend of mine when it started raining.
I can understand it.
Is this mink?
Who defended Tom?
He advised us against doing it.

I wish I could figure out how to convince Tom to stay.
We got to the summit at dawn.
What do you think of me now that you know me better?
He must be innocent.
Somebody has stolen my money.

Tom isn't a vegan.
I don't know whether it's good or not.
I'm not sure what Tom's plan is.
It won't be hard.
Tom isn't a pediatrician.
Tom asked someone else to do it.
It must have been something really big for him to strike a triumphant pose like that.
Please explain it to me later.
This question is for all three of you.
You must read between the lines.
What's your favorite TV show theme song?
It's no use asking me for money.
I found a dollar in the street.
Tom kissed Mary again.
I heard a young girl call for help.
How many days does a leap year have?
I will show you around the city.
I am afraid to go.
I heard screaming.
That's okay.
Will you keep this seat for me?
Everyone was silent for a minute.
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
Tom isn't as rich as Mary is.
I'm living with my uncle.
The world is changing every minute.
Which is your favorite browser?
I'll return at 6:30.

A new bridge is being built over the river.
How much is the rent per month?
I lied constantly to my wife.
This medicine has no side effects.
I think that Tom is out on the porch.
I talked my boyfriend into buying me a ring.
He is a perfectionist.
Are you from Boston?
What should I see?
Tom took off his clothes and put on his pajamas.
Do you have any more questions?
These trousers are made of durable cloth.
We took turns washing the car.
I lost my briefcase.
A girl drowned in the pond yesterday.
When would it be convenient for you?
Do you like school?
I arrived too late and missed the train.
This annoys me.
What have you been doing?
May I open the window?
"I haven't been feeling too good lately. ""You had better go to a doctor."""
We have three cats.
Relax.
See you tomorrow at school.
Water boils at one hundred degrees.

He was a professor at Cambridge University.
Why don't you buy a new car?
Would you please mail this letter by airmail?
Are you saying Tom didn't help at all?
Is it spicy?
It rarely snows here in the winter.
He studied English history.
My kid is being toilet trained.
He was here at that time.
Tom likes to make paper airplanes.
Which expression do you use more often?

This is the last straw.
Tom never wears jeans.
I hear he is looking for work.
I left home early so I wouldn't miss the train.
"If you get good grades at school, I'll let you go to Boston next summer."
You speak like your mother.
I'll wash the dishes.
Where is your jacket?
You'd better consult an attorney beforehand.
It's my job to take care of the baby.
It's getting cloudy.
A man of common sense would never do such a thing.
The vacation came to an end all too soon.
He finally decided to try.
No one has been able to reach the top of the mountain.
I like both of them.
How do you like your new school?
Have you decided what to do next Monday?
That's mostly right.
Tom usually skips breakfast.
How do you get to school?
I'm surprised to hear that prices have gone up so high.
He sat down beside her.
It was very hot inside the bus.
Freedom of speech is restricted in some countries.
I forgot to turn off the gas!
I couldn't sleep because of the heat.
I was flat on my back for a week with a terrible cold.
This is useless.
Call me when you get there.
Please lend your car to me.
"The door opened, and a man came out."
This bridge is three times longer than that one.
It's Tom's thirtieth birthday tomorrow.
I hear from him every now and then.
Tom closed the office door.
I had no idea it'd be this beautiful.
The whole town knows about it.
You must make your own decisions.
I enjoy reading books.
What's it made from?
That's Tom's room.
The second sentence was about the same length.
I'm staying with a friend.
I'm not going to tell you.
A fork fell off the table.
I'm a bit pushed for money.
I'd like to see the doctor soon.
I thought that you'd gone to Boston.
You'd better give up smoking.
Tom closed his eyes.
How far away is the border?
Tell me about it!
There are as many men as there are stars.
Do you think Tom can do that by himself?
Has Tom tried it?
I don't have a car and neither does Tom.
There's a vital link between the two.
I'm the one to blame.
Do you have any more questions?
Everybody is in a good mood looking forward to the five-day holiday that starts tomorrow.
All but one were present.
I missed the point of the joke.
That won't be successful.
Are you still friends with Tom?
You could accomplish some amazing things if you put your mind to it.
These are my favorite shoes.
My wife often telephones me when I'm traveling in another country.
Get to the point.
I can do it without her help.
Tom's grinning.
Whose candy is this?
I don't want to go to jail.
She is a student.
The reasons are as follows.
This is the best.
He sent a card to Mary.
We were fully satisfied.
There's no oxygen on the moon.
There's not a soul here.
Most people like watching TV.
I'm so busy that I have no time to read.

Try to avoid bad company.
Sometimes it is pleasant to look back on one's childhood.
What do you say to going to the concert?
When was it that you first met her?
Nobody came to help me.
I couldn't hear the sound well.
It seems simple.
I was eighteen then.
I'm the owner of this building.
My great-granddaughter is eight years old.
Have you found your contact lenses?
You should get your eyes examined.
I was at a loss for words.
I have to leave school.
"I'm sorry, but we're out of stock."
Tom's work is selling second-hand cars.
Tom retired.
You must be careful when you drive a car.
Could you solve the problem?
He went to Africa to see wild animals.
I'm surprised you're so naive.
I skipped breakfast.
The rent for this apartment is very high.
You always take things too easy.
Mary was wearing a navy blue dress.
What an idiot I am!
"Give me $1.00 back, please."
The theme park was closed down last month.
These clothes suit you.
Which book do you think I should read first?
I was very impressed by his story.
I never drink tea.
I don't know whether to cry or to laugh.
I seem to be lost.
The policeman examined my license.
Tom has already started.
I'm first.
The roads are full of cars.
What're you doing here?
Give us a call when you arrive.
Tom is a lazy bum.
I listen to the radio every day.
Tom told her that he had written that poem two years before.
Tom found his key under the sofa.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji twice.
Could I make a reservation?
"In any case, I'll call you tomorrow."
Mary found a long blonde hair on Tom's jacket.
The teacher will get angry for sure.
Smile.
I think I'll skip this class.
When do you study?
I have a splitting headache.
I regard him as an enemy.
I went to Europe by way of America.
Whose desk is this?
I don't want to eat any more.
Do you remember what you were wearing the first time I met you?
Tom is introverted.
Tom isn't yet able to swim.
This work isn't hard.
Tom looked nothing like his profile picture.
My hobby is reading.
I'm not very hungry.
Put this in your backpack.
The seaside is an ideal spot for the children to play.
"I was very tired, so I went to bed early."
This is the same purse that I lost a week ago.
How is Tom doing?
What do you want for Christmas?
Tom isn't a teacher here.
"Stand back, please."
I want to scare Tom.
Tom was hired as an interpreter.
Tom looked in the mirror again.
There's an old castle at the foot of the mountain.
You're always the cause of my worries.
None of them were present at the meeting.
Both Tom and Mary are fast asleep.
Many politicians don't keep their promises.
Wonderful!
I'm full.
It was very hot on the bus.
May I have something to drink?
It's your turn to drive.
I coughed up blood.
Don't throw away this magazine. I haven't read it yet.
"I had a headache yesterday, so I didn't do that."
Tom spends all his time on the computer.
I don't really see it that way.
Tom is loyal to his wife.
"Since it's important, I'll attend to it."
I never thought college would be this much fun.
The most common first name in the world is Mohammed.
Why were you late for school this morning?
Tom and Mary are siblings.
I felt a cold wind on my face.
Could you come back here again tomorrow at 2:30?
Goodnight.
I don't know what I don't know.
That girl wanted to become a movie star.
This place has everything.
"Thanks for everything, Tom."
I met him yesterday for the first time.
Someone is following me.
Tom might not be at home tomorrow morning.
Tom tagged along.
He moved the desk to the right.
He passed away quite suddenly.
Where does your uncle live?
My sister is too young to go to school.
Tom doesn't listen to anybody.
That's what I was told.
Draw the curtain.
My sister works part-time at a clothing store downtown.
No one knows.
What's the matter? You look sad.
You'll find the shop around the corner.
Everyone would like to believe dreams can come true.
Would you like some more salad?
There's a cat under the desk.
"Not having seen her before, I did not know her."
See you tomorrow.
Get up as early as you possibly can.
"Tom is planning to go, no matter what."
"You're Tom's friend, aren't you?"
Can Tom come tomorrow?
I bear no grudge against you.
"That isn't so difficult, is it?"
Does Tom have a horse?
I got a text from Tom.
I wish I had a girlfriend.
I'm at the beach on holiday.
I don't have a car.
Did something happen between you and Tom?
Tom had never been in a girl's room before.
It's a good idea to cover up when the sun is this strong.
There are lots of fish in the sea.
The month is drawing to an end.
I lost my wife last year.
Everybody is afraid of Tom.
I've loved comic books since I was a kid.
A frog came out of the water.
I'll send someone up to help you now.
My kid is being toilet trained.
Did you turn the light off in the living room?
He talked to himself.
I heard several explosions in the distance.
"With more education, he would have found a better job."
The stars were twinkling in the sky.
A few minutes' walk brought me to the park.
He is afraid of death.
I ate pizza every day last week.
I've always wanted to meet you.
I like butterflies.
I decided to switch the light off immediately and go to sleep.
Is there anything I can do to help?
He neglected his duties.
I'm restless.
They don't know that we're Canadians.
Tom has beautiful blue eyes.
Where's the shopping center?
He was born in Switzerland.
She goes to night school.
He founded the school five years ago.
Tom is too impatient.
"When does he study? ""He studies before dinner."""
Tom decided to take matters into his own hands.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
"Tom is 13, but he still believes in Santa."
It makes me happy to hear that.
I am looking forward to your letter.
He hates running.
This room doesn't get a lot of sunlight.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.
The supermarket opens at ten o'clock.
What's your favorite Mexican food?
Ugh! I lost my phone again.
Tom is a lazy fellow.
The restaurant is full.
Do you want to go to a coffee shop?
Tom isn't yet thirty.
I had my hair cut.
"Be careful, please."
The unemployment rate went up to 5%.
Her girlish complexion belied the fact that she was over forty.
I'm not Tom. I'm John.
There is no simple road to success.
It is time to shut the gate.
What's the weather forecast for tomorrow?
I can't take any more.
I'm chicken.
That's not it.
"I'm getting hungry. ""Me, too."" ""Do you want to eat?"" ""OK."""
Is that seat free?
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
Tom fell asleep on the train.
Your secret is safe with me.
Please drop in to see us any time you're in town.
"If you don't want to attend Tom's birthday party, you don't have to."
Our baby can't talk yet.
See you Monday.
We prayed for their happiness.
He was sitting on a bench with his eyes closed.
The suspect was hiding out in the mountains for three weeks.
It's eight o'clock at night.
Tom had to come back to Boston.
I had to stand in line for hours.
I shoved my hands into my pockets.
I started to get annoyed.
Please open a window.
I need this money to last me until the end of the month.
Tom made some sandwiches for us.
This is too short.

A lot of trees were cut down.
He has gone to Hokkaido.
How are things at work?
I go to the gym two or three times a week.
"In the morning, we put away our futons."
Are you going to the theater tonight?
I'm 30 years old.
My work at school was well above average.
What's Australia really like?
Tom ate a cheeseburger.
I'll take the next bus.
Tom is an excellent cricket player.
That wasn't my fault.
There's something I'd like to ask you.
We'll contact you next Monday.
She abstains from drinking.
"I don't know her name, but I do know her by sight."
We'll be landing in fifteen minutes.
"It's really cold, don't you think?"
I expect her to pass the examination easily.
Do you go to school on Saturday?
I don't think Tom is right.
Thank you for coming.
Tell me when to start.
I'd like to ask you about Tom.
There were quite a few students absent from class today.
I didn't know that Tom was unhappy.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
I'd like to see the doctor.
She asked me if I could sew.
I owe it all to you.
She began to like him right away.
I have never eaten a mango before.
"The population was 18,432."
This is our chance.
We exchanged glances with each other.
I don't think that she will come.
"You're good at French, aren't you?"
I want to learn how to swim.
I go to school by subway.
Tom is a world-famous writer.
This is a good dictionary for high school students.
"The banker's pay cut was temporary, not permanent."
Shut your trap!
Don't come before six o'clock.
Where is today's paper?
"Will you be going, too?"
I advised Tom to study harder.
There used to be a tall tree near the temple.
A fire broke out during the night.
Did Tom talk to you about that?
Where did you buy your motorcycle?
That was the last roll of toilet paper.
Please open the window.
That's interesting.
Tom left at four in the morning.
He leaned against the wall.
"I'm from Boston, but now I live in Chicago."
"I was very tired, so I fell asleep right away."
Tom is a better swimmer than Mary.
Where in Boston is Tom planning to stay?
It wasn't a dream.
Does anyone in your family smoke?
The government has imposed a new tax on wine.
Please speak in a low voice.
I thought Tom was over Mary.
Is that all you've got to say?
It's not like that.
My mother is sick with a bad cold.
Safety always comes first.
Tom gave Mary a kiss on both cheeks.
Tom didn't kiss me good night.
Tom is in the attic.
I hope that Tom isn't still in Australia.
The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.
I really want to know why he did that kind of thing.
Tom promised that he'd wait.
Everybody loves puppets.
Can I use this bike?
Tom forced a smile.
"You were in the second year of middle school last year, right?"
My son can count up to a hundred now.
Could you please turn on the lights?
Are you finished?
The event is still fresh in our memory.
I promised that I'd do that.
I've already eaten my lunch.
It seems that the news was false.
The fever has abated.
It's OK to take a picture from outside.
How much time will that take?
Tom was completely worn out.
I think Tom is optimistic.
I heard you made a big mistake today.
I want to sing with Tom.
How is this pronounced?
Put it in the corner.
What do you think of my new apartment?
I'm not feeling well.
"Without air, nothing could live."
Would you please let me know what the status is right away?
Tom is blind in one eye.
You have dirty feet.
"No matter who says so, it's not true."
"You know you need to do that, don't you?"
She was educated by her grandfather.
Tom misunderstood.
She's older than Tom.
I'm no longer worried.
There were 500 people in attendance.
Mary is the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
You can use my desk if you want to.
Oil has played an important part in the progress of civilization.
We can't play baseball here.
I reckon we'll see him once more.
I'm afraid I took your umbrella by mistake.
I wish you could've come with me.
You should leave immediately.
I barely made the train.
I suppose I felt a little jealous.
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour.
Say it one more time.
Was the window closed?
This road leads to the station.
Try to estimate how much you spent on books.
The children were playing in the sunshine.
I'd like to get medical insurance.
I like writing with a fountain pen.
I lost my way in the woods.
He glanced at his watch.
You should tell Tom what you want.
I didn't hear a thing.

Let's order something to eat.
"To be honest, I didn't know that."
How's your wife doing?
My father has many books.
"At your age, I was already married."
He is used to speaking in public.
I don't know how old Tom is now.
"Now that we are all here, we can start the farewell party."
Don't worry. We're doing just fine.
I haven't seen Tom for several years.
Please wrap it like a Christmas present.
"Until now, I've never been spoken to by a foreigner."
When and where was Beethoven born?
He drew a straight line with his pencil.
I don't want to go to Boston.
I could use a little coffee.
See you on the weekend.
Would you mind not smoking?
Give me something to do.
Little did I dream that we would expand our business to the U.S.
I'm good at playing the piano.
Tom is driving a truck.
I heard you bought a house.
Tom said that he'd get home by 2:30.
I have other plans for tomorrow.
I had my hat blown off.
I studied hard to enter the school.
You were just doing your duty.
Why don't we order pizza?
Why do we have to learn all this?
Take a left at the first corner.
I feel a bit nauseous.
I saw a number of people around the police box.
What time should I come to the lobby tomorrow?
"Whatever you do, don't forget this."
That's none of your business.
This is my wife's car.
I can't think of his name.
We must obey the rules.
He can't be young.
"A ""shiitake"" is a kind of mushroom."
I sometimes go out for a walk.
She treated his broken leg.
"Watch your step, or you will slip and fall."
Don't worry about me so much.
Do you want something to drink?
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
The cat slowly approached the mouse.
What do you want to study at college?
I made friends with them at the school festival.

Advance two steps.
Accidents will happen.
"By the way, do you play the violin?"
I asked my teacher what I should do next.
Put on a jacket. It's cold.
I need to buy some groceries.
Tom took a tiny bite of Mary's donut.
I bought a T-shirt.
Put down your name and address.
It's better not to go there alone.
I can't buy it because I don't have any money.
How much will it cost?
The old woman was ill in bed.
I had a good idea.
Tom is full of hope.
How do you spell your family name?
Who's going to help me wash these dishes?
I don't really like Tom.
I like spring the best of the seasons.
This ticket allows two people to enter.
Tom is good at telling jokes.
I'm looking forward to receiving your favorable answer.
Tom is trying his best to do that.
The paint is peeling off.
"Tom could do that by himself, I think."
Just get back.
The mountaintops are hidden by clouds.
A good idea occurred to me just then.
I didn't know Tom could cook so well.
He will pass the upcoming examination.
My mother is preparing lunch.
Are you familiar with this?
Where did Tom buy those gloves?
He is happy.
I suck at relationships.
I'm thankful for my family.
"Wait a moment, please."
The medicine didn't help at all.
Picasso painted this painting in 1950.
Tom drives a nice car.
Thank you for today.
Can I smoke in here?
Why did you decide drop out of school?
Tom has been working as an interpreter.
Do you want to drink some beer?
Tom isn't able to swim.
I wonder if you'd talk to us for a moment.
What kind of meal did you eat?
Be sure to get a receipt.
Tom works in a coffee shop.
I would like to try this dress on.
Note how I do it.
I cannot walk any farther.
It's dangerous!
That's a beautiful ring.
The dog will not harm you.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
I have an idea.
The track meet was called off on account of the heavy rain.
"I went to Boston last week, too."
Can you come and help me zip up my dress?
I don't have the strength to keep trying.
I'm a nurse.
I drank the coffee.
I believe the police will ignore you.
Tom turned up thirty minutes late.
I asked my mother to wake me up at four.
We have two ears.
Let's tackle this problem from another angle.
"For him it may be possible, but I'd never pass the test."
Have you fed the horse?
Don't put your hands out the window.
The building was totally destroyed by the earthquake.
Thank you for waiting.
This tastes so much better than what Tom usually makes.
I've heard a lot about you.
I want ice cream.
What a coincidence!
This house has six rooms.
I can't put up with the heat any longer.
I ran as fast as I could.
You mean to say that you know the answer?
I'm busy with homework.
I wish to climb Mt. Fuji again.
It's been raining for three days.
The explanation was beyond my understanding.
It's very new.
I phoned the police immediately.
"I want a car, but I don't have money to buy one."
5 is less than 8.
Cut it out.
Are you in much pain?
I saw a boy with colorful shoes.
I was sweating.
I guess you'll be very busy tonight.
I understand.
I want to stress this point.
This one and that one are the same length.
That's quite absurd.
I'm against the bill.
She went in search of her lost child.
Where is the money exchange counter?
He drank detergent by mistake.
"If you're hungry, eat."

My older sister loves children.
I don't like beer that much.
Tom seems to be crying.
I left Japan for the first time in ten years.
Were you with my father today?
Tom doesn't know that I'm here.
I feel well today.
I don't think that it's strange at all.
A human body consists of a countless number of cells.
When did you come to Japan?
I went to the hospital to see my wife.
I watched TV this morning.
Cherry blossoms are very beautiful.
Don't smoke too much.
See below.
"If you keep doing things like that, you'll be hated by everyone."
Please wake me at six.
Are you saying you don't want to go to Tom's party?
My phone rang again.
I'm an ophthalmologist.
I always do this first thing in the morning.
What foods are you allergic to?
"When I first met Tom, I was eighteen."
She has blue eyes.
My doctor recommended I eat more vegetables.
I got some sand in my eye.
Tom said that he didn't agree.
"If you want your workers to be happy, you need to pay them a decent wage."
Is that person your younger sister?
Five years have gone by since my father died.
I'm sorry to call you so late at night.
He was visibly nervous.
You should be able to read this book easily.
They made us work all day.
I think it's going to rain today.
He advised me not to smoke.
That dress is made out of silk.
Is this course good?
"To the man who only has a hammer in the toolkit, every problem looks like a nail."
Let's have a ten-minute break.
He adjusted the telescope to his sight.
I can't eat this much.
Tom is very busy on Mondays.
I wouldn't do it if I were you.
I belong to the drama club.
I thought that you were still in Australia.
That is the shop where I used to work.
He both speaks and writes French.
There were more than 100 students there.
Tom died in a car crash.
I ate two apples.
Many people told me not to eat there.
I could eat a horse.
Can I go swimming this afternoon?
The TV needs to be fixed.
We'll finish the work even if it takes us all day.
I got up a minute ago.
She leaves for New York next Sunday.
I grew up in a little town.
Everything is on schedule.
He did not know what to say.
How do you put up with it?
I lather my face before shaving.
"Tom wanted to ask questions, but he didn't."
I'd like to stay here for a few more days.
That's a very good idea.
I said something stupid.
I think I've told you this before.
I just finished reading your book.
She has a sharp tongue.
Can your mom drive a car?
I usually work alone.
"You are joking, right?"
Open that door.
I'm the tallest in our class.
I deny everything.
Is he American?
Everybody started to panic.
No one can resist.
Can you read that sign ahead of us?
Nice to see you again!
What language do they speak in the United States?
I wanted to stay in bed all day.
"I want to do that, but I don't have the time."
He lay down on his back.
I hope to see you sometime.
Check it out!
Please say hello to her.
That's a bit cold.
Spring is drawing near.
Our coach is Canadian.
She graduated with honors.
Thank you for your kindness.
I was late for school yesterday.
I watched a Canadian movie last night.
You should use a deodorant.
Who's the man playing the piano?
I have had it.
We should consider the problem from a child's point of view.
It's a joke.
Tom isn't sure what Mary plans to do.
Did you have a good vacation?
Tom was shot twice in the chest.
It was that car.
A fuse has blown.
The train was delayed because of an accident.
Can you recommend a restaurant that has good Korean food?
Are they looking at us?
I cooked dinner.
Come and see me again.
Father would often read detective stories in his spare time.
"As I was about to leave the house, I received a phone call from Tom."
Please help yourself to some fruit.
Come anytime.
She did come here.
Tom could do that.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
He has the ability to do the job.
"I have a fever, so I won't go to school today."
We have some new products we'd like you to see.
When was the last time you traveled by train?
Is that Tom's?
You should read this.
You should've knocked before you came in.
Could you loan me some money until payday?
I bought a book.
My battery ran out.
I don't want to hide from you anymore.
I give up.
I could kick myself for not inviting Tom and Mary to my party.
Why don't you study French?
Are there any places you'd recommend?
Tom didn't want to stay at home alone.
Could I have some water?
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
Do you have a motorcycle?
Where is the restroom?
We're leaving early tomorrow morning.
"Memorizing the order of a deck of playing cards is definitely not easy, but it's not impossible."
Tom walks slowly.
Please take me away from here.
Tom doesn't want it.
I had a race with him.
I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep. Good night.
Let's go eat something.
She got married last year.
You'll have a hard time.
What's eating you?
You can reach the park by either road.
Please don't shout.
My e-mail address has been changed.
Did Tom tell anyone?
Tom has a good head on his shoulders.
Tom and Mary talked for about three hours.
"If I had bought the painting then, I would be rich now."
Who'll look after your dog tomorrow?
I need to go shopping.
Let me in.
I prefer spring to summer.
Don't open this box.
You can download the instruction manual for the heat exchanger here.
The tie goes with your jacket.
Why do you think Tom did it?
Don't go in that room.
Tom is trapped in the cave.
"Meanwhile, you can stay with us."
"If I had taken that plane, I'd be dead now."
I'm tired of it.
Keep your dog chained up to the tree.
I'm really not interested in history.
He resented being called a coward.
I'll come later.
I want Mary back.
Nobody knows where he has gone.
Tom knew Mary was busy.
She denied having met him.
I'm cooking now.
I don't like what he said.
Tom thought that Mary was nervous.
Tom decided to give up city life and live in the country.
"As soon as we find out anything, we will contact him."
This type of cat has no tail.
Did you watch the news today?
I'm not as healthy as I used to be.
The door opened slowly.
She invited him in.
I got the pears for nothing.
The old man told the children an amusing story.
I copied in my notebook whatever he wrote on the blackboard.
I want to eat apple pie.
Tom taught me how to make an origami ninja star.
I wonder where the corkscrew is.
You've come too early.
Do you have an English dictionary?
I must go to work early today.
I don't care about your past.
Tom looks down on women.
The mirror broke.
"She loves Tom, not me."
These roses bloom in spring.
What's that bird?
Is Tom eating an apple or a banana?
Do you have any foreign books?
Our store sells carpets.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
I like it very much.
Our city was covered with smog.
I'm used to going to bed very late.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
I've been really lonely since Tom left.
Don't tell on me.
His advice counted for little.
This is not what I ordered.
Are you sure there aren't any snakes in Ireland?
I can't really explain it well.
He speaks English fluently.
The young man that you saw is my brother.
It is still as cold as ever.
I can't put up with this hot weather.
I'm very interested in fishing.
He deserves the punishment.
Have you been living here for long?
Baseball is different from cricket.
Will you show me the book?
That's a relief.
Who will you vote for for president?
I said no.
I should have left earlier.
I bet Tom could do that.
Don't you have an air conditioner?
I must buy one.
It is like casting pearls before swine.
May I see your license?
We're going out for lunch. Why don't you come along?
Tom is still under age.
He died of old age two years ago.
This is a ring.
I was asked to put away all the papers we used at the meeting.
Don't say such childish things.
A famous architect built this house.
Do you like sushi?
It was a long flight.
Leave immediately.
The art teacher paints at night.
I'm much younger than Tom.
Remember to mail the letter.
Be quiet while I am speaking.
Shall I help you?
I shouldn't have eaten the whole bag of potato chips.
Take a cookie.
Please move the TV set to the left.
I can't get over my cold.
I don't know for certain.
These patients have difficulty walking.
Where did you buy that ticket?
Tom is punctual.
The child soon fell asleep in the bed.

Why would Tom care?
He was asleep during the lesson.

This watch needs to be repaired.
This novel has also been translated into French.
My uncle lived a happy life and died a peaceful death.

He lived abroad for much of his life.
Your book is on the table.
"Throughout the five years of painful cancer treatments, he managed to keep a stiff upper lip."
Why did you do something so stupid?
I just can't get along with Tom.
Don't do that again.
He mentioned it.
Microwave it for thirty seconds.
He called my name.
"At first, they were all convinced he was innocent."
Not a star was to be seen in the sky.
Do whatever you want.
It doesn't matter to me if you open the windows.
May I ask why?
He denied having said such a thing.
The only thing Tom needs now is a little patience.
That isn't a proper thing to say.

I'll go home by taxi.
They set to work at once.
Was Tom here all day yesterday?
Were you drinking that day?
Is this your umbrella?
You ought to go home early.
Where's everyone?
"They say you shouldn't take rumors seriously, but that's easier said than done."
I don't have a computer at home.
He's the tallest in the class.
He went down the hill.
I'm a little nervous right now.
Would you please turn down the TV a little?
I'm really tired.
I'm really hungry.
Can't it be me?
Tom came into the room.
I heard a call for help.
Please keep this money for me.
I haven't yet finished my homework.
This one is much better.
I think they're both right.
Do you have any in blue?
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

This is perfectly normal.

He fell asleep while reading a book.
Call us anytime.
I have a black and a white dog.

I have a friend whose father is a famous novelist.
I saw him enter the room.
Have you ever been to Boston?

"You love your mother, right?"
His car is two years old.
Do not fail to come here by the appointed time.
It wasn't anybody's fault.
Why don't you come in?
I have many model cars.
We must leave right away.
I wouldn't let Tom do that if I were you.
When are you going to call me?
Are you teasing me?
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
She spends all her time thinking about boys.
Tom and Mary are quite different.
"Do you want to go for a walk? ""Let's wait until later in the afternoon when it's cooler."""
You are mistaken about that.
Tom feels inferior to Mary.
You're good at this.
This is the problem.
The milk has gone bad.
How about some Spanish food?
Please put your baggage on this scale.
We want you to behave yourself during meals.
Tom isn't a thief.
I'm not sure that Tom can do that again.
"If you don't believe me, go see for yourself."
I can't see anything with my right eye.
They moved here recently.
Thank you very much for lending me your umbrella.
Blood is thicker than water.
It's time to take your medication.

I don't think that Tom is as stubborn as Mary.
You haven't changed at all.
Have you finished your preparations for the trip?
I was away from home all through the summer vacation.
I'm concerned about Tom.
He stammered out a few words.
She is crying.
This is what I was waiting for.
I caught sight of the boy escaping from the classroom.
I didn't know where it came from.
I'm sure I have the right number.

It's a difficult problem.
You're lying to me.

I met her by chance.
The sky is blue.

Tom was just trying to apologize.
Is the game still going on?
Are you two about finished?
He was looking through a microscope.
I am of the opinion that she is right.
I'm happy I could help.

No one knows the reason.
This is the best book I have ever read.

Where were you last night?
Tom has been studying.
You shouldn't eat between meals.
You'll find nothing here.
This car was made in Japan.
You are very beautiful.
You should leave at once.
The apricot trees are in full blossom.
This sweater is made by hand.
Tom is in the hospital now.
You're wearing your socks inside out.
I have heaps of money.
Please write your contact address here.
Our teacher lives close by.
You can ask me anything you want.
He has blond hair.
She bought a baby chick.
"To me, this is a big deal."
No one noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
It's unlike him to get so angry.
Don't try God's patience.
He committed five murders.
Tom and I can both speak French.
We're not kids anymore.
Chess is hard.
It isn't good to stay up late at night.
Show me the photo.
Of course.
It's your turn to pay for lunch.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Are you Canadian?
"I've been lucky, I think."
A thief broke into the house to steal the money.
"No matter how fast you run, you won't be in time."
My father has been doing this job for twenty years.
What will you do after graduation?
Who ate the bread?
Tom regained his balance.
I am not kidding.
This doesn't concern you.
Why is Tom in the kitchen?
I'll take attendance.
Her large income enables her to go to Paris every year.
Nobody in the world wants war.
Let me say what I think.
Is there a possibility that you're pregnant?
Sunset is at about five o'clock.
Thank you very much for your hospitality today.
That sounds interesting.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I've won the lottery.
Are you from Australia?
I owe you an explanation.
I went home to change clothes.
"No, not at all."
I should've studied more when I was young.
She was wearing a new hat.
The factory has laid off some three hundred workers.
"Beat it, kids!"
He used to bully his friends.
My mom is older than my dad.
Tom was alone in the house.
Tom was Mary's first love.
She felt blue.
Where did you find Tom?
He's accustomed to climbing mountains.
He's a kind person.
How do you say that in Italian?
Bear in mind that half one's life is lived after forty.
I think that it'll be hot today.
Wake me up at seven o'clock.
The next class starts in five minutes.
He is good at diving.
Have you ever been to Canada?
Tell me how to play the game.
"Are you and Tom still together? ""No, we split up at the beginning of last month."""
I feel sad every now and then.
Go straight ahead.
"She is not a doctor, but a teacher."
Have you ever been to the Korean Peninsula?
"Tom is on a low-fat, high-protein diet."
This dictionary is expensive.
That country is about twice as large as Japan.
Tom broke a window yesterday.
Is it true you can't swim?
May I escort you home?
Why were you late for school this morning?
What sports do you play nowadays?
Tom opened the window even though his mother told him not to.
She hadn't noticed the cold until she opened the door.
Tom has a personal bodyguard.
He emphasized the importance of peace.
Have both of you already eaten?
What's your favorite season?
What's your favorite number?
Are you starting to get tired?
Tom ought to know.
The food at that restaurant wasn't all that great.
Tom only has eyes for Mary.
I'll check your vision.
"Tom wrote a love letter to Mary, but she didn't read it."
Is it done?
I'm as happy as a clam.
Tom knows many famous people.
I've lost some weight.
It wasn't easy to solve this problem.
I like to go and watch baseball games.
I'm afraid that I caught a cold.
October 20th is Tom's birthday.
That's a surprise.
The train is supposed to leave in five minutes.
What's your favorite thing about the Christmas season?
I offered to help her with her homework.
You're going too far.
The supermarket is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
I happened to be out when the call came.
What are you afraid of?
I am glad to run into you here.
Who made the highest score?
Was anybody here while I was out?
This car is easy to drive.
I believe in God.
Is that all?
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
Let me think for a minute.
She's a noted singer.
You get what you pay for.
A fire broke out near my house.
I feel that we forgot something.
Let's ask the teacher.
I was dressed up as a girl at the school festival.
We might meet again in the near future.
Tom asked if any of us could speak French.
I saw a skunk.
"Could you close the door, please?"
I bought some cheese and a little milk.
"As soon as we find out anything, we'll contact you."
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
My sister Mary is now in Boston.
You don't need to prepare a formal speech.
It was my decision and I don't regret it.
I've been very busy since this morning.
Do you play any instrument other than the piano?
I can tell whether it's Tom or not by the sound of his footsteps.
No one was there except for Tom.
I'll take the most expensive one.
Tom handed Mary the picture.
I hate the rain.
We'd better call the police.
The train made a brief stop.
Take a deep breath.
I'm from Singapore.
You're certainly looking fit as a fiddle today.
Tom filled the tub with water.
I went to get vaccinated.
Don't waste your breath.
I can't raise my right arm.
You mustn't smoke in this room.
There are a lot of fish in this lake.
I commute to Tokyo every day.
I went to bed hungry.
I hate my voice.
It was difficult to answer that question.
He belongs to the upper class.
I work different hours every day.
There's a lot of work to be done.
I had a bad dream last night.
Why don't you give tennis a try?
"I got lost, and to make matters worse, it began to rain."
This is the best book I've ever read.
Who are you?
I'm scared to death.
Several children are playing in the sand.
I don't like either of the two clocks.
I'll try to repair it.
Where have you traveled?
Which do you want?
I also have a question.
My throat feels dry.
She held her breath.
How did you like the party?
He wrote the report.
Which way should I go?
That disease is incurable.
This is a great time-saving gadget for the housewife.
You'd better go there on foot.
I have many things to do.
In what month were you guys born?
We're going to leave tomorrow.
Tom still hasn't shaved.
How is everyone?
How're you doing today?
She drew out the money from the bank.
Tom said that he'd never tried water skiing.
He hates her.
Please don't interrupt me while I'm talking.
He came to Japan when he was 10 years old.
The tragedy happened suddenly.
The children are learning to add and subtract.
Please take off your hat.
Everything I said is true.
We adopted a child.
This is a picture of my girlfriend.
She first came into contact with Japanese culture last year.
Planning the wedding before proposing is putting the cart before the horse.
"There are many books, aren't there?"
I've brought a cup of coffee.
I had enough money to buy what I needed.
I'm not sure why Tom didn't want to meet Mary.
No one was in the room.
Put on your school uniform.
Have you met any of Tom's friends?
I need to buy a new carpet for my room.
Don't phone me tonight.
Wine is bad for your liver.
She's a really nice girl.
"How do you go to school? ""By bus."""
It's raining cats and dogs.
Tom thanked me for the gift.
I found a rare book I had been looking for.
Few students knew his name.
This watch cost me ten thousand yen.
I'll be there in a minute.
Who's there?
There's a jar of pickles in the fridge.
I think you should see a doctor.
I think that Tom is going to faint.
Tom often makes careless mistakes.
I'll buy both this one and that one.
Those two children were the same age.
I think this sweater will look good on you.
Who is that guy?
I went to the airport to see my friend off.
I like to gossip.
I know that Tom is strong.
This is the book I told you about.
What're you looking at?
I have nothing to live for.
Their efforts were not for nothing.
Did you hear that a burglar broke into the neighbor's house?
The sun will soon set.
"Tom is from Boston, but now he lives in Chicago."
What's in this bag?
Tom got that from Mary.
Just answer the question.
Can we get to the beach by bus?
What'll we do if it rains?
I left my umbrella on the bus.
I'm awfully tired.
I don't think that Tom is available.
Be careful. It's slippery here.
Do you think that Tom is happy?
Tom loved to travel.
She loves cats.
My family is a large one.
Tom didn't say a word.
"Aren't you scared, Tom?"
Do you really think that we're that stupid?
Tom couldn't get to sleep till after three last night.
Tom is afraid that something bad is going to happen.
Tom baked a fig cake.
Please fill in this application form.
Tom opened the door quietly.
He sent the letter back unopened.
It was only supposed to be an interim solution.
Tom and Mary have two cats.
Any comments will be gratefully appreciated.
There's nothing that can't be bought with money.
"She requested help, but no one came."
The elevator seems to be out of order.
There's milk in the fridge.
His story may be true.
Tokyo's population is larger than London's.
Zip your lips.
We need to comfort Tom.
Can I take photographs here?
The shoppers stood in a line.
"Tom clicked the ""submit"" button."
He can't walk any more.
She's clearly over forty.
Tom denied everything.
Many people around the world go to bed hungry every night.
Tom used to dream of playing professional baseball.
It's raining again!
My father is in his fifties.
I don't speak Japanese.
Are there any other suggestions?
There's not much hope.
You said you wanted to ask me something.
I chickened out.
This passport is valid for five years.
It ought to be fine tomorrow.
What do you think is the best film that you have seen this year?
What are you doing for New Year's?
She came to Tokyo when she was eighteen years old.
My boss was very strict.
"He's rich, but he's not happy."
I have something I need to tell you.
That's a good idea.
I'm really good at figuring out problems like this.
Spring has come.
Take care of yourself.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom seems to have a lot of friends.
I'm happy to hear your voice.
This suitcase is very heavy.
You don't have to hurry.
Tom is a student.
You make mistakes if you do things in a hurry.
Please follow my finger without moving your head.
Tom died.
There are no limits.
"When Tom got to the station, the train had already left."
My internet connection was cut off.
May I call you tomorrow?
She helped him.
I don't have anything to write with.
That's lovely! Where did you get it?
He caught my hand and pulled me to the second floor.
I turned in a paper yesterday.
Tom made breakfast for Mary.
I'm watching TV now.
Tom may not be hungry.
He just won't listen. Talking to him is like talking to a brick wall.
"If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going."
They're both good.
My family are all early risers.
I've learned to cook.
He looked up at the stars.
You must face the facts.
Aren't you spending Christmas with Tom?
Was he lying on his back?
What's the exact time?
He seems to be in good health.
You smell funny.
Whose is this car?
I got up at five that morning.
Let me go alone.
My mother prepares my meals.
There's no turning back.
"What's up, kiddo?"
I can hardly see anything.
It's almost October.
How was your test?
It has stopped raining.
He donated a lot of money.
"As soon as we sat down, she brought us coffee."
The children are playing with blocks.
Do you want to go?
There are still many things we don't know.
I'll do my best to get there by 2:30.
The police didn't believe Tom's story.
Tom's new house is really nice.
I've received no reply from you yet.
Tom knows that I wouldn't cry.
Children were running to and fro in the park.
He designed the car.
They are actors.
My sister will have been studying English for ten years when she graduates from her college.
Is this your first time here?
Is that your wife?
I watched them skin a human being that day.
I'm sorry that you've been badly injured.
I got up early in order to catch the first train.
It's not easy to catch a rabbit with your bare hands.
I've loved you for a long time.
I don't think that this shirt goes with that red tie.
My son is going to be a teacher.
A conservative tie is preferable to a loud one for a job interview.
That's a popular question.
He cleared out his desk.
Tom and Mary are about the same size.
I like playing sports.
Have I done something wrong?
Tom planted a peach tree.
You can rely on me.
Is it cold outside?
"Sorry to trouble you, but can you help me?"
I saw Tom standing near the window.
Tom said that he believes Mary.
The room was in complete darkness.
"If there's something that you don't understand, please feel free to contact us."
I thought you'd finished that already.
How many flights a day do you have to Boston?
You might have told me.
Tom said he wasn't drunk.
Is it OK if I come?
I can't think of any other plan.
Don't drink so much beer.
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
My grandfather goes for a walk on fine days.
May I have a few minutes of your time?
I stayed up until 2:30 a.m.
I had lost my pen.
Let's rent bicycles over there.
He accomplished his mission.
I think we'd better talk outside.
Why haven't you told Tom yet?
You do not have to go to the dance unless you want to.
Tom is learning to ride a tricycle now.
He has his hair cut once a month.
He keeps a cat.
Whose car is that?
I can hardly wait until summer.
"Fasten your seat belt, please."
Tom trained his dog to bark at strangers.
None of my students would do something like that.
Everyone knows that I'm Tom's girlfriend.
I pretended to be working.
Now drink up.
I was wondering when you'd get back.
Our dad gave it to us.
Is there a parking lot?
I can't follow you.
I don't feel very good.
I'm very happy.
I prefer black.
What do you say to going for a drive?
Do you have any Japanese newspapers?
I'm feeling kind of spaced out today.
I'd be more careful if I were you.
Is that a leopard?
I climbed the mountain last summer.
My uncle is staying with us this week.
Let's have some coffee first.
"Today, I don't feel like doing anything."
He is sure to come.
That's mine.
I was no match for Tom.
Where's your father now?
Will you make coffee for me?
What time is convenient for you on June seventh?
Tom has good diction.
"Being exhausted, she was soon fast asleep."
Please go back to your seats.
I can't help you move the piano because I have a bad back.
But I don't think it's at all odd.
He got lost in the city.
I am determined to carry out this plan.
Do you like playing in the dirt?
What time will you come pick me up?
We've won!
It snowed hard yesterday.
I'm sober.
My father never hits me on the head.
What's the difference between religion and philosophy?
Let me carry that box for you.
Everyone wants money.
I didn't do it.
I found this book by chance in a secondhand bookstore.
Tom gave me this shirt.
Use acrylic paint.
His horse jumped over the fence.
My wife showed excellent taste in decorating the room.
Do your homework now.
He will be only too glad to help you.
How wide is this road?
Take the medicine three times a day.
I'm not the man I was when you first knew me.
I'll be right back.
Is it OK to use this?
I really had an enjoyable childhood.
Did Tom call?
I'm fine.
I don't need a lawyer.
How much is the most expensive car?
Will you run for governor?
Come a little closer.
Do you like to dance?
May I borrow your dictionary?
Don't dump garbage here.
I heard Tom sneezing.
He is far from rich.
I applied for a visa.
"Even though Tom is only sixteen, he looks like he's over twenty."
The grass is wet.
I was up almost all night.
Tom and Mary got married just three months after they met.
That shop sells newspapers and magazines.
She continued with the work.
"Because the entrance was locked, we couldn't enter the house."
We didn't expect so many people to come.
Everybody knows that two and two make four.
I thought as much.
Do you have seasonal allergies?
I like chess.
We are flying over the Pacific.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
He is writing a letter to his parents now.
I was thinking about her.
"When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere."
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
"Foreigners are interesting, aren't they?"
Thousands of people were there.
I warned you.
English is spoken in many countries around the world.
"If you drink warm milk before you go to bed, it'll help you fall asleep."
Tom is a very rude man.
Everyone is wearing a mask.
We don't get snow here very often.
I think Tom is narrow-minded.
Have you ever sung in public?
I should've read that book.
I didn't need your help.
Let me in.
The headlight doesn't work.
He promised me that he would come at four.
She appeared to have forgotten my name.
Let me try to explain.
In no way is he a man of character.
All three of those men are carpenters.
I heard someone whistle.
We don't care what he does.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
I can't eat that much food by myself.
I'd like to be alone.
Thanks for making me laugh.
Where's the information counter?
Her red dress made her stand out.
Are you through with the newspaper?
Is this your bicycle?
He is by nature a generous person.
I want to keep this house as it is.
I was amazed at Tom's fluency in French.
What's today's plan?
How did Tom get to know Mary?
Feel free to share your thoughts.
Tom might never walk again.
Take as many peaches as you want.
That's real convenient.
"In the late eighteenth century, a passport for an American was usually signed by the President of the United States."
I don't think Tom would buy that.
I like fish more than meat.
I drank two cups of coffee.
Tom isn't as rich as Mary.
I have a driver's license.
I thought we could eat out on the patio.
"If you need money, I'll lend you some."
He always speaks ill of his father behind his back.
What seems to be the problem today?
There are three suitcases near the door.
I could not sleep because of the noise.
I bought this T-shirt on sale.
I'm pleased to meet you.
Where did you see that woman?
Let's do it again.
Where did I put the key?
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Are you getting bored?
I hated French in high school.
You look sick.
I'm not a child any longer.
Please give me a Band-Aid and some medicine.
Tom doesn't want to talk to anyone.
She takes piano lessons once a week.
I think you can get it.
I need another three hundred dollars to buy what I want.
I went shopping in town today.
Thank you for your work.
Tom waited for the kettle to boil.
"Sometimes I say ""yes,"" even though I want to say ""no."""
Don't start with that again.
I wonder whether Tom will go to Boston or not.
London is small compared to Tokyo.
The jet plane had 500 passengers on board.
"If only I had a map, I could show you the way."
How's Tom's neck?
The bell is ringing.
We tried to make out the letters written on the wall.
Does anybody have a charger for an iPhone?
Are you still not feeling well?
It was because I was ill that I couldn't go to school yesterday.
That song always reminds me of my childhood.
Three times five is fifteen.
I arrived here at eight this morning.
I'm leaving now.
I found it difficult to understand what he was saying.
You don't need to worry about such a thing.
Please write your name with a pencil.
I'm eating now.
The line is still busy.
Tom flipped off the lights.
Cool off!
Are you Tom's friend?
This bread is very good.
The waitress spread a white cloth over the table.
Tom came out of the room last.
What's the exchange rate today?
She had hardly begun to read the book before someone knocked at the door.
I'm just beginning.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
What do you usually eat for breakfast?
He agrees with my opinion.
I found that restaurant by accident.
"To be honest with you, I don't like Tom."
Please pass the note around.
He likes that teacher.
I'd like to see it.
You'd better not waste your money.
The train arrived at the station thirty minutes behind schedule.
Why don't you come inside?
Tom never goes anywhere by himself.
I burned myself with boiling water.
One of Tom's friends was killed in a traffic accident.
Have you bought your ticket already?
Do you think fish can hear?
Tom tossed Mary the ball.
She managed to drive a car.
Which side won?
I'm not carrying any cash.
Are you hurt?
I like taking walks.
He always leaves for work at 8:00 a.m.
We were all rather exhausted.
I don't know what went wrong.
The tape recorder was on the table.
"If we unite our efforts, we'll be able to finish this."
Next year my birthday will fall on Sunday.
He couldn't go out because of the snow.
He's washing his car.
Thank you for your concern.
Don't kick the door open.
I saw a girl with long hair.
What's for dessert?
Can you think of a better idea than this one?
Do you believe that God exists?
Are there any French-speaking doctors working here?
I see.
I'll be home all day today.
You don't need to worry about such a thing.
I wrote my name on a piece of paper.
My brother has a part-time job in a library.
I took off my sweater because it got warmer.
Your French is very good. Where did you learn it?
That software was released six months ago.
Hang on one second.
He wrote to his parents.
At least 100 people attended.
Tom has shaved off his mustache.
I have no idea how to deal with my daughter.
Turn in your homework.
You're much taller than you used to be.
He dropped in on me last night.
What lovely flowers!
The day's already over.
We'd like to confirm our reservations.
"How many push-ups can you do, Tom? ""I used to be able to do a hundred easily, but I wonder how many I can do now. Maybe 50 or so?"""
I can't go with you today because I'm very busy.
Tom bought a six-room house.
My older sister's marriage has finally been arranged.
This bread is freshly baked.
They eat meat once a week.
You won't be able to catch the train.
"Today's your birthday, right?"
This is a pretty big deal.
I went to the park to play.
Our daughter will be in the Shichi-Go-San festival this year.
Tom was stung by a bee.
He is the last man to break his promise.
Would you like to come along?
Do you catch colds often?
Tom looked in the refrigerator.
I wish Tom hadn't told Mary that I'd been in prison.
Send me a copy of the report.
"I've met you before, but I can't remember where."
Hold your tongue!
Tom comes to Boston once a year.
Is it true Tom's father is famous?
Do you really hide your money under the mattress?
Tom knows Mary doesn't like raw eggs.
A cat was sharpening its claws against a post.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
Tom was a good husband and a wonderful father.
May I sit down?
I ordered new furniture.
Did you buy those books?
I apologize for being late.
It isn't very difficult.
You'll never defeat me.
Whose umbrella is this?
Give me what you have in your hand.
Where's the nearest museum?
The school is within walking distance of my house.
Please take a look at this picture.
I have no money.
I'm ready to roll up my sleeves.
I couldn't make out what he was saying.
There are no rules without exceptions.
This picture was taken by him.
Tom loves French.
It's time to reflect on your past.
I gave a speech at the wedding yesterday.
He knows close to nothing about this issue.
I don't think this shirt goes with that red tie.
I sold my books cheaply.
Tom and Mary lived in Boston for a time.
I know well what Tom wants.
She opened the door.
It's easy to see the fireworks from over there.
My grandma bent over to pick up a needle and thread.
Tom looked at his watch.
Should I have my tooth extracted?
Tom says that he's hungry.
It will be winter before long.
Tom is always bad-mouthing Mary.
I prefer history to geography.
My mother is preparing dinner.
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
Let's keep this matter between ourselves.
Tom and Mary are the same height.
I'll do whatever I can to help you.
Let's exchange phone numbers.
She spends time with her grandmother every Sunday.
I asked Tom to go there.
I spent my vacation at the beach.
You should go.
I'm going to play tennis.
Tom is the captain of this baseball team.
The rumor may be true.
I have to use French all day.
My waist size has recently increased. I guess it's middle-age spread.
He is acting for the chief director.
This chair is too low for me.
The pond is 3 meters deep.
I'll see that it never happens again.
He underwent a risky operation.
He left for London the day before yesterday.
It's too soon to tell.
She gave her father a tie.
"If it's raining tomorrow, let's go by car."
"Close your eyes, and listen carefully."
He turned his back on the old tradition.
I told Tom that I'd get him a gift.
I'm glad I was able to help.
I can take care of yours truly.
"You've read the report, haven't you?"
It isn't mine.
I went to the zoo.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Let's help her.
She has to stop smoking.
How old were you when you learned to write your name?
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Do you have any employees who speak French?
Everyone froze.
She is playing with her friends.
I think Tom's grandmother is too old to wear a miniskirt.
I need to do some shopping since Christmas is almost here.
No sooner had she caught sight of me than she started running in my direction.
It is good to be kind to old people.
When did you go there?
"No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it."
It's a great idea.
Did Tom reply?
Won't you come in and have a cup of tea?
Tom and Mary are talking in the kitchen.
So much has happened. It's as if the whole world is flipped upside down.
We run the store jointly.
"The people here are particular about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it'll soon go out of business if the food doesn't taste good."
He was hit by a car.
I'm feeling blue today.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Eight is two times four.
Don't ask me for money.
I found it difficult to solve the problem.
I want to be that doctor's patient.
"A few minutes later, the telephone rang."
They had no food.
"May I have the check, please?"
Do you believe in UFOs?
Time flies.
I have to wait.
You aren't going to make it in time for school.
Tom knows that he's right.
Do you think tomorrow's weather will be good?
My eyes are watering.
Tom and Mary have three sons.
I can't get rid of my cold.
Why is your French so good?
Mary is studying in her room.
I think it'll rain this afternoon.

Call me if you change your mind.
We've had a lot of rain this month.
Let's go outside and sit in the garden.
"Don't worry. He may look intimidating at first glance, but he's actually a very friendly person."

You know that that isn't true.
Tom is a dancer.
I think that book isn't so interesting.
He's likely to come.

The temperature was below freezing last night.
I can't live without you.
They drink a lot of lemonade.
I feel as if we've already met.
We use a lot of water every day.
Is everything OK with Tom?
Tom's parents are wealthy.
All I ate was bread.
Let's talk.
"If you try, you'll succeed."
I never thought it would turn out like this.
"Next time, ask me before you use my car."
Mary is Tom's sister-in-law.
Behave yourself during my absence.

I've got a great idea.
I completely agree.
We followed the deer's tracks.
This car can go 300 kilometers per hour.
He traveled on business.
It is a cold morning for June.
Tom blamed Mary for the accident that killed their son.
That small star is the brightest.

Pardon me for interrupting you.
When will you be free?
It is warmer today than yesterday.
Are you going out with anyone?
We are about to leave here.
Tom will probably be scared of Mary's dog.
"Today, I have a lot of homework."
I don't know.
I have a ton of things to do.
I had a lot of time to talk with my friends.
"At seventy, he is still active."
I forgot what I was trying to say.
Tom asked Mary if she could play the accordion.

The sun sets in the west.
I don't want anything.
Is it true that Tom can't drive?
It is worthwhile learning Spanish.

I burned the letter.
You'd better not tell Tom.
It takes two hours to get there by bus.
"If I had more money, I'd buy that."
"The children were walking along, singing a song."
She acted as if she knew nothing.
I wanted to tell Tom about Mary.
"What he told us the other day simply doesn't make sense, does it?"
My parents don't know where I am.
I was kept waiting for nearly half an hour.
"What's your name? ""My name is Tom."""
I go to bed at eleven every night.
Why is nobody eating?
"In case of an emergency, get in touch with my agent."
Someone stole my passport.
How old is Tom?

They'll be playing soccer tomorrow.
The snowstorm raged for a full week.
Were you at home last night?
I've never been to Europe.
Would you please lend me some money?
That's not altogether false.
This is the very best method.
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
Tom has been hunting for a job ever since he lost his job last year.
Blue is my favorite color.
You can count on him.
I'm a little nervous right now.
They don't seem to be Americans.
I'm blind in the right eye.
I feel bad.
Your kids are cute.
"Which do you like better, apples or bananas?"
I used to be homeless.
I am only joking.
You should have a doctor look at that.
She was aching from head to foot.
I think it's dangerous to swim in that river.
It suddenly started raining very hard.
Do you think I'm crazy?
He took off his coat.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do such a rude thing."
I think that he wants to buy a new dictionary.
Consult a doctor.
The moon came out from behind the clouds.
We received a warm welcome.
The speed of the spread of AIDS is horrifyingly fast.
I borrowed a book from the library and read it.
Where do you intend to spend your vacation?
Tom went into the kitchen to get a drink of water.
Where does it leave from?
Please fasten your seat belt during takeoff and landing.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
I shouldn't have asked.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
Nobody taught me.
See you at 2:30.
Could you come as quickly as possible?
That's exactly what he said.
Could you give me your name and phone number?
It's not very difficult.
I'm already hungry.
Don't open the door no matter who comes.
It's pitch black outside.
I refuse to answer the question.
May I accompany you on your walk?
Our favorite place to eat is that small restaurant on the corner.
It's not easy for me to travel alone in Japan.
"If you're busy, I'll help you."
Please speak in a loud voice.
I want to listen to Japanese music.
There has been no rain for two months.
You probably don't like them.
You should've known better than to lend Tom money.
The wind has calmed down.
Tom put on his socks.
He likes music very much.
I will go there even if it rains.
He will come this afternoon.
I am able to swim across the river.
"In Japan, the school year begins in April."
Does Tom like golf?
That's no longer a problem.
May I turn on the TV?
The pain was terrible.
Is this some sort of joke?
Wait a bit.
She was often late for school.
She had a strange hat on.
"You know that person's name, don't you?"
What does Tom consider to be the most important point?
Nobody could answer Tom's question.
The work is progressing steadily.
"If I had time, I'd go to the movies."
"Bring me a glass of water, please."
May I leave this book with you?
I'll do the same thing you do.
"What! This T-shirt is 3,000 yen? This is a rip-off!"
Did you enjoy reading that book?
Food is essential to life.
Do you mind if I open the window?
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
My mother is out.
I bought some bread.
He asked his friends for help.
Casualties are expected.
I have to put the baby to bed.
You may sit wherever you like.
"Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the bus stop?"
Tom needs help.
"Where is your book? ""On the desk."""
My brother's room is smaller than mine.
Am I the only one that doesn't agree with you?
"Having read the book, I could answer all the questions."
I didn't think Tom would be interested in buying any of Mary's paintings.
Everybody was calm.
People over the age of 18 are able to drive.
The damage was held to a minimum.
"It would be good to sleep, even for just a little bit."
It began to rain toward evening.
The dog kept on barking.
Does your mother know about this?
I need someone to help me.
"If there were no sun, we wouldn't be able to live."
I lay awake in bed.
My little brother never helps around the house.
I can't judge distance.
There are people who read books to kill time.
It's really cold today.
Their way of thinking is behind the times.
She acted as if she knew nothing about it.
Do you think it'll be muggy tomorrow?
I don't like sad movies.
You're overthinking it.
I can't drive.
Don't follow me.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
He seems ill.
I wonder who'll do that tomorrow.
Tom and I went to the same high school.
I smoke cigarettes.
My grandfather is in his nineties.
Tom seems to know that Mary did that.
"Would you mind shutting the door? ""No, not at all."""
This school has many students.
I've found another job.
I didn't know you could drive.
Can you come tomorrow?
The roof of my house is red.
I don't know when he's coming.
I wonder why Tom isn't at home.
I was involved in the trouble.
The magician asked for a volunteer from the audience.
"Hello, it's me. Could you come pick me up at the station?"
A book dropped from the shelf.
"When I got home, my mother and father were fighting."
Are you coming to Tom's Halloween party?
I have a bad headache today.
Tom painted the window frames yellow.
Give me what you have in your hand.
Please reply as soon as you've read this email.
I was at home.
The station is situated in between the two towns.
Thanks for the drink.
"Tom makes his bread with only 3 ingredients: flour, water and salt."
"By the way, where are you from?"
I became a member of the club in 1980.
The child had no overcoat on although it was very cold.
Tom might not want to eat dinner.
Please take me across the river.
The traffic jam lasted one hour.
How much money do you spend on clothing every year?
I'm worried.
Perhaps that's true.
I'm proud of being a doctor.
The movie was good.
Tom translated a French novel into English.
Do you have any smaller sizes?
The scenery of the Alps left a lasting impression on me.
Thirty years passed.
The workers took pride in their work.
I just wanted to check my email.
"She was tired, but she kept working."
I like this kind of music.
"Please be ready by 2:30, OK?"
This is a good dictionary.
Tom showed up at the party wearing a suit and tie.
It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
"All of a sudden, all the lights went out."
"Extension 45, please."
"Next Sunday, there'll be a concert in the park."
We must do away with these old rules.
Justice will prevail in the end.
Tom wasn't permitted to tell Mary everything he knew.
Sign above this line.
I wrote down his name so I wouldn't forget it.
We know where you are.
It's a fifteen minute walk from here to the campus.
Tom bought Mary a small gift.
I can talk about anything with my best friend.
Are you getting Tom anything for his birthday?
She asked the police for protection.
Moderate exercise will refresh both mind and body.
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow.
He made up his mind to keep a diary every day.
Is it hot in Boston now?
He's away on a trip.
Let's take your temperature first.
She devoted her entire life to the study of physics.
"If I were younger, I would go abroad to study."
I saw a man enter the room.
She was pleased with her new dress.
I am doubtful whether he will come.
They do it just for the thrill of it.
It soon began to rain very hard.
"Although the arguments were rational, he was not convinced."
Please speak a bit more slowly.
It used to be taboo for women to smoke.
Both Tom and Mary were wearing black coats.
Tom comes here almost every day.
"If you want, I'll visit you tomorrow."
She made some derogatory remarks about her colleagues.
It was a dirty trick.
Tom said he thought that I was dead.
You've done a very good job.
That shop is a hamburger shop.
We were a perfect couple.
Do you have a few minutes to spare?
Is this the place where the accident happened?
Tom forwarded the email that he received from Mary to John.
She presented him with the trophy.
Tom often gets lost.
Do you promise you won't tell anybody?
Is it true Tom and Mary are dating?
Why didn't Tom do that?
It'll take you days to finish this job.
I know Tom can swim.
Can you ride a bicycle?
This is different from what I expected.
The cost of living is very high in Tokyo.
You can go home now.
The sky was full of stars.
My head hurts.
Could I have a cup of coffee?
I haven't learned to do that yet.
"Even though Tom and I have birthdays just one day apart, he's one grade ahead of me in school."
The correspondent filed a report from Moscow.
Today is a bad day.
I'd rather stay here than go there.
What's in your suitcases?
"Look forward, please."
What did you eat last night?
Please read the meter.
When was the last time we spoke?
Would you please close the window?
It's bath time.
Tom doesn't like giving speeches.
I was not a good mother.
She always has a serious look on her face.
We will have learned English for five years next year.
Anything is fine.
I didn't notice it.
I was involved in a traffic accident.
This isn't a mistake.
These shoes are too tight. They hurt.
How are things with you?
Why did you lie?
They say that seeing is believing.
Nothing was in the room.
He is nice.
That's fine.
Sometimes I want to eat stew.
She has changed a lot since then.
It was hard for him to live on his small pension.
I want to return to Australia.
"How old is she? ""She is twelve years old."""
Aren't you busy on Mondays?
Tom wore a coat.
She stopped talking.
She is always finding fault with her neighbors.
I'm glad that you weren't hurt.
Did you meet her?
Drink this.
We had plenty of time.
I think that Tom was hungry.
I heard a scream.
I'm not saying it's impossible.
Wonderful!
I'll ask the teacher about it after class.
He just got home.
Tom said he was puzzled.
Will you help me?
Have you seen my father?
You should not go there.
Tom is living in Boston.
He dropped a letter into the mailbox.
"I'd like one of each, please."
"Well, we've finished at last."
Is it OK if I use that?
He caught a chill because he went out in the rain.
Do you play football?
"If he could pass for eighteen years old, he'd join the army."
Put the book back on the shelf.
I was invited to a party yesterday.
Hold on firmly to the handrail.
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
I lent my friend some money.
He wants to get a new dictionary.
"When funds are limited, priorities need to be set."
You and I are the same age.
The river flows between the two countries.
Please listen carefully to what Tom is saying.
"Tom will be in Boston all week, won't he?"
I wrote it down in my notebook.
"It's none of your business, so don't mess up things by getting involved."
We stopped taking pictures.
This isn't mine.
"Have you known Tom for a long time? ""No, I've only just met him."""
Don't forget to sign your name.
Children like playing on the beach.
Are you guys hungry?
Was this somebody else's idea?
"This summer, it hasn't rained at all."
The key is under the mat.
Tom is in church.
Playing baseball is fun.
It took less than five minutes.
I've always wanted to climb Mt. Fuji.
Tom moved to Boston.
Guess what happened to me.
She is shy of strangers.
I can't afford to buy it.
Tom and Mary went to the aquarium together.
Where did you learn that word?
Aren't you going to spend Christmas with Tom?
You did a really good job.
I drink beer every day.
It's going to rain tomorrow.
Are you going to call the police?
The two countries are antagonistic to each other.
Their habitat is threatened by deforestation.
I'm not a professor.
Boston is a big city.
Food has been in short supply.
"Switzerland is situated between France, Italy, Austria and Germany."
I meant you no harm.
He ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
Tom sent Mary money.
You have a very good memory.
Tom got attacked by a dog.
He learned how to put a radio together.
Turn down the TV.
"He drives a car, doesn't he?"
I am in favor of the option.
He has been dead for five years.
He sat right in front of me.
All you have to do is go there.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
It was such a shock.
Country life is very peaceful in comparison with city life.
I'd better go with them.
Tom watched the squirrels play.
I do not believe the weather will change for the worse next week.
He likes coffee without sugar.
He likes swimming in the summer.
Tell Tom I said hi.
I'd like a map of the city.
The baby in the cradle is very pretty.
I'll be with you in a second.
The pain has mostly gone away.
They're on pins and needles.
I don't disagree with your decision.
"You remember her, don't you?"
Did you know that vinegar can be made from dates?
My hair stood on end.
I have a dog now.
How can I get to the train station?
I don't blame you for doing that.
I got here yesterday.
It ought to be fine tomorrow.
She was absent from class.
I never did like it anyway.
They are very kind.
How did you get to know about her?
It was a silly rumor.
You can't be too careful in choosing your friends.
Put your coat on. It's cold outside.
What has happened?
"Unfortunately, it rained yesterday."
I'm awfully sorry that I was late.
You are mad to try to do it all alone.
"Whenever I see you, I'm reminded of your mother."
It isn't always easy to know a good book from a bad one.
There's one thing I want to know.
It is dangerous to swim here.
We need Tom's strength now.
Can a child of her age distinguish good from bad?
I suggest that the meeting be postponed.
Is the snake alive?
That's a great idea.
It's too expensive.
It takes time to heal from a divorce.
I have lost the key.
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor.
What do you usually do after school?
"In my opinion, he is correct."
He's considering visiting his uncle.
I don't want to become a lawyer.
I got up early this morning.
Who's the DJ today?
Tom invited us to lunch.
Tom's my cousin.
The moon was full last night.
"I'm tired, too."
When was it finished?
I'm not going to leave until I find out what happened.
I get up every morning at six.
Don't leave it up to chance.
You must be joking.
I wish I could use magic.
We came back to camp before dark.
I don't think this is interesting.
Would you please close that window?
Give them to her.
What brings you to Boston?
We are accustomed to wearing shoes.
This shop has more candy than that shop.
May I ask why?
I bought a dictionary.
He painted a picture of a dog.
He teaches English.
She easily catches cold.
I won't lose!
You don't have to apologize.
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
These pants are too fancy for me.
I don't think he killed those men.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
My grandfather hopes that I will enter college.
Tom doesn't have any interest in sports at all.
He is playing there.
"I care very deeply for you, she confessed."
I'm not sure if it was good or bad.
I can read without glasses.
Tom was wearing an old T-shirt with holes in it.
It's something Tom made.
Two problems remained unsolved.
He is an evil man.
"According to the weather forecast, it'll rain tomorrow."
You should eat breakfast.
Is there a post office near here?
We can see Mt. Fuji clearly today.
My parents forbade me to see Tom again.
The weather stayed cold for three weeks.
Today is Valentine's Day.
Are you telling me you've never studied French?
Nobody can destroy a true friendship.
Your singing puts professional singers to shame.
I'm glad you're OK.
I tried those shoes on.
We ordered 40 minutes ago.
When is checkout time?
I've already forgotten how to do that.
"I got cold, so I turned on the heater."
I don't believe that God exists.
He ordered them to release the prisoners.
Tom is doing that already.
I think you're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
I don't have any camping equipment.
Tom proposed to me.
He narrowly escaped being killed.
This is an imitation diamond.
Time passed very quickly.
We live in a civilized society.
This song is very popular in Japan.
I'm hungry!
You look just like your big brother.
I'm not exactly sure where Tom is.
I went home to change clothes.
Mary was kidnapped by pirates.
A luxury liner arrived in the harbor.
Tom and Mary live in the same house.
I think that I've met you before.
Sea turtles have a long lifespan.
We are a family of four.
Tell me the truth.
We should obey the rules.
He constantly criticizes other people.
It took me half an hour to work out this problem.
"Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go there."
I'm a freshman.
I haven't seen one of these in forever.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
Tom said he disagreed.
I don't drink soda.
I'd like to wait here.
It's quite complicated.
I need to make a few calls.
She grew up to be a beautiful lady.
You can stay with us for the time being.
I promised him to keep it secret.
The cat is sitting on top of the table.
"Now, it's your turn."
A new shopping mall opened on the edge of town.
Do you have Tom's address?
Can you do me a favor?
She makes me happy.
She's not penniless.
Tom showed interest in the plan.
Can you do this problem?
The map is on the wall.
Did you have a piano lesson that day?
Tom is at the door.
I have to go to the airport to meet my cousin.
It's so bright that I can't open my eyes.
I don't think that French is difficult.
I'm not a child any longer.
Sit beside me.
When did you arrive?
She is watering the flowers.
"From now on, be more careful with your money."
Do you mind my turning on the radio?
He'll win for sure.
"I tried to be calm, but finally I lost my temper."
I was shot.
You're joking!
"Maybe I'm unhappy, but I don't intend to kill myself."
She usually wears jeans.
We just bought a house.
"Now and then I think of divorcing him. ""You must be kidding!"""
How many Christmas cards did you receive last year?
It's not a big deal.
Long skirts were in fashion in those days.
I missed the train by a minute.
You must get rid of that bad habit.
I want to go to the movies with you.
These grades are unacceptable.
What's your impression of the United States?
I've got an attractive proposition for you.
Who's your favorite writer?
Tom and Mary got married in 2013.
Tom didn't have any socks on.
Tom is too old for Mary.
"For lunch, I ate leftovers."
I don't know.
"Since it's raining, it would be better if you stayed at home."
You should go to the dentist and have that tooth pulled out.
Every man has his price.
Tom recently hired three more workers.
I'm sure of winning the tennis match.
That can't be true.
I'll stay home if it rains tomorrow.
He seems to be honest.
Monday's not good.
Don't you have work today?
I could not find it anyplace.
A fire broke out after the earthquake.
There were a lot of cars.
He can see nothing without his glasses.
There's a possibility of war.
What were you doing then?
Tom likes trying out new things.
I keep a journal.
I've been here since Monday.
I bought an old lamp.
He swallowed detergent by mistake.
I'll be reading a book.
Don't panic!
Where can I get some help?
I can't wait until Monday morning.
Is he still here?
My eyes feel itchy.
I think Tom is a little too optimistic.
I don't recommend that.
Have both of you already eaten lunch?
I love this restaurant.
This isn't my responsibility. It's yours.
I've changed my website's layout.
Look! There goes a shooting star.
Everything's returning to normal.
The train is ready to start.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't get fired.
I don't know how to express my thanks.
I had met her many times before then.
I didn't buy them.
"What day is it? ""It's Wednesday."""
Sunshine is beneficial to plants.
It's far better than before.
I'm eating an apple.
It took me a month to get over my cold.
He moved from place to place.
I'll never forget the day when we first met.
Tom couldn't believe nobody laughed at his jokes.
Is Australia an island?
They called off their engagement.
You should know.
Please feel free to use my dictionary.
I'll go meet him soon.
Perhaps we'll see each other again tonight.
Why does Tom like Australia so much?
Perhaps we should do that together.
Try on this sweater.
He'll make someone clean the room.
I was captured.
She introduced me to her brother.
I'm in the hospital.
There haven't been any problems so far.
Could you please repeat what you just said?
It's already seven.
Are you ready for bed?
More than enough is too much.
I caught three fish yesterday.
Summer is over.
I said shut up.
My eyesight isn't as good as it used to be.
That bus stops in front of my house.
Does Tom know anything about that?
Would you believe me if I told you I loved you?
That is just her way.
"Mary is intelligent, isn't she?"
I don't want dinner.
I hate Tom for many reasons.
How should I know?
I'm not busy now.
I've decided to watch this movie.
It isn't easy.
Is Tom absent today?
The office has been transferred up to the sixth floor.
We have to buy water from Malaysia.
We could've helped her.
She's five years younger than me.
He is mad about music.
Marriage is a serious matter.
I'd like to have ketchup on the side.
It's simple.
"Is it true? ""I think so."""
I learned French very quickly.
My husband was killed.
She held her breath.
How far is the airport from here?
When will you harvest your wheat?
This is all I can do for you.
These plums are ripe.
I asked him if he would help me.
Tom has already finished breakfast.
You should follow his advice.
I never said that to you.
I'm not worried about that one bit.
"I could go on and on about it, but I won't."
Which newspaper do you work for?
Am I on the right road?
Where do you want to go?
I don't like music as much as you do.
I didn't fall asleep until after 2 o'clock in the morning.
Many students compete to get into the best universities.
This was a memorable day for me.
Is your husband also from Boston?
Tom tried to show Mary how to do it.
I've been busy lately.
Tom is very good at catching bugs.
There were bear tracks in the snow.
Tom and I are friends.
Let's go outside. It's too noisy in here.
"Cats are like girls. If they talk to you it's great, but if you try to talk to them, it doesn't go so well."
He made me go.
It's a waste.
Please remember to mail the letter on your way home.
I'm really worried.
Tell me exactly what you did.
We must register for the courses that we're going to take by tomorrow.
I get the point.
Maybe it'll rain tomorrow.
I can't convince Tom.
Put down your guns.
My father works here.
I don't know when my father will come back.
He grew old.
Tom goes to work every day but Sunday.
We're all looking forward to seeing you and your family.
I was just in time for the last train.
They've been arrested.
I found the book interesting.
Won't you go to the concert with me?
I normally wear skirts.
Let me help you with that.
Tom gave Mary his telephone number.
I can't stand it anymore.
"Wow, that looks tasty."
He is about to leave for London.
Have you given Tom the key?
Tom goes camping every summer.
This one is cheaper than that one over there.
He earns more money than he can spend.
Would you like some cookies?
"It's not only sports that I like, I like music, too."
Don't get paranoid.
Could you spare me a few minutes?
How old are Tom's kids?
You're now old enough to support yourself.
Why do you want to die?
I already knew it.
Tom gained weight.
"He is not a friend, but an acquaintance."
She resembles her aunt.
What time is your plane scheduled to leave?
Hold it with both hands.
"Did you say that Tom has left the hospital? That means he'll be coming back to work soon, doesn't it?"
The resolution to the problem was close at hand.
Are you still studying French every day?
I'm looking for my older brother.
What time is it? he wondered.
I wonder if life exists on other planets.
It rained all day.
I'm looking for a place to sit.
Come right in.
It was easy to answer.
Have you seen Tom this morning?
A lot of soldiers were killed here.
Was everyone listening?
I've lost my pencil.
My birthday is coming soon.
What is the main industry in this town?
How many flights a day do you have to Boston?
"The weather is nasty, isn't it?"
It looks like Tom will be last.
Do you know the rules?
Did you seriously do that?
This cloth feels smooth.
Do you take credit cards?
How much of this did you know beforehand?
If only I'd left home five minutes earlier.
How many times a year do you go scuba diving?
Let Tom stay here as long as he wants.
No one thinks we'll win.
I'm sure that our team will win.
The foreigner didn't know Japanese at all.

His job is driving a sight-seeing bus.
Please translate these sentences into French.

Five years have gone by since my father died.
She lay on a sofa with her eyes closed.
That's very difficult.
I didn't want to spend any more time alone.
I study English at home.
You can't do that.
Put down your pencil and listen to me.
I have to go home and change.
Please tell me what I should do.
Tom graduated.
I must catch the first train.
I think that Tom remembered me.
She speaks English fluently.
Is it difficult work?
Tom and Mary threw snowballs at each other.
Do you think that I'm fat?
Do you mean you don't know how to do this?
There isn't anywhere else to park.
What do you want to do?
Tom isn't as scary as he used to be.
Wine is poetry put into a bottle.
I bought this for my girlfriend.
You look happy today.
I live within walking distance of school.
Open all the windows.
Why are you so confident?
Are you sure Tom is OK?
It seems unlikely that the train will arrive on time.
She really wanted to tell the secret.
We're dead tired.
She's on a roll.
"Tom hurt his left knee during practice, so John had to play the game in his place."
"You like olives, don't you?"

He gets a haircut once a month.
I have no choice but to do that.

A mother tends to hold her baby on the left.
I sure wish I could have a three-day weekend.
I'll be at home all day today.
I had my car filled up at the service station at the corner.
There's something odd going on.
Is the rat alive or dead?

He was very poor.
He must have entered this room.
I'm glad that the rain has stopped.
Tom eats at least three bowls of rice every day.
It is getting warmer day by day.

There was no delay.
Where is the mailbox?
This is the only book I own.
"I want to know more about you, Tom."
Who's winning?
Do your homework right away.
What he says has nothing to do with this problem.
School begins at half past eight.
But I don't think it's strange at all.
August the eighth is Beard Day in Japan.
We gain wisdom with age.
Are you having fun?
Go away!
That flower has a strong smell.

I booked a seat.
I'm expecting.
He is having lunch now.
I've lost three kilograms.
How was your trip?
I've been to Paris twice.
Who told you that?
I'm seriously thinking of selling my house.
Hi! What's new?

I wish that was true.
The cold wind is blowing from the sea.

I read this book when I was in elementary school.
The rainy season has set in.
The ambulance came quickly.
She has many valuable books.

I feel as if I were dreaming.
Do you like French wine?

I like being alone.
Let's meet on Sunday.
I haven't seen you for ages.
"It's worth a try, right?"
I don't want to study today.
I've never thought that.
I have a lot of things to do.
"If the shop is closed today, I'll try again tomorrow."
"I'll help you, too."
"Do you want me to turn off the computer? ""Leave it on. I'm still using it."""
Don't you think you're a bit old to go trick-or-treating?
It's a pain in the neck.
You don't need to worry anymore.
She is afraid of dogs.
Tom gets scared easily.
Why did you get divorced?
A person with common sense would never do this kind of thing.
A horse passed my house.

It looked like fun.
The door remained closed all day.

He fetched some water from the well.
Thank you very much for your understanding.
She pleaded with him to stay.

It was raining that day.
Communications have been cut off for two hours because of a thunderstorm.
I'm a stranger here.

Today is a warm day.
Ask him where he parked his car.
Is anybody in there?
Do you know what he said?
How old is that boy?
He accomplished his mission.
Do you take travelers' checks?
They got through the marsh.
"Can you tell me your name, please?"
Those two experiments yielded similar results.

Did you order the book?
We took pictures of the dolphins.
You're very astute.

I'm glad to make your acquaintance.
I think that I'll come back later.
Tom and Mary live in a small log cabin.
Mary has been looking for a job since she graduated.
This can't be right.
He was crying.
"It's well known, but it's not popular."
I haven't weighed myself recently.
Don't touch this button.
Thou shalt not kill.
"Entering the house, I tripped over the mat."
I dozed off in the train and slept right past my station.
He's my age.
Did you ask the price?
My grandfather lived to be ninety-nine years old.
This tastes moldy.
How did you spend your vacation?
I shouldn't have done it.
This is the hotel where we stayed that time.
I hope you'll get well soon.
Your lack of sleep will catch up with you someday.
Yesterday morning I ate a waffle.
I'll tell you the rest tomorrow.
I often oversleep.
I can't say that's the result I was hoping for.
It's a little warmer than usual today.
I am dying for a cold drink.
Does Tom know why Mary doesn't want to go to Boston with us?
"At first, I had trouble understanding people when they spoke too fast."
Tom isn't Mary's grandson. He's her nephew.
I'm short of money.
I don't have the money right now.
Many people die in traffic accidents.
I've retired.
Does the pain wake you up at night?
Tom has many talents.
I don't like to mix business with pleasure.
The English alphabet has 26 letters.
I didn't know that the cost of living was so high in Australia.
Who yelled?
How many churches are there in this city?
Are you mad?
Why are you so depressed?
I have enough money to buy it.
She committed a crime.
Do what you want.
"That's useful, isn't it?"
Tom was covered in sweat.
Tom was skipping rocks on the pond.
Get a grip on yourself.
I was surprised to hear the news.
What made her so angry?
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
Tell me why Tom is crying.
I wonder whether or not it'll rain tomorrow.
"If I were you, I'd go home and take a nap."
Can you catch fish with your bare hands?
He makes frequent visits to Japan on business.
Wait until 2:30.
Discussions are ongoing.
Tom is a heavy drinker.
My phone is dead.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
There were more spectators than I had expected.
"Tom looked around, but saw no one."
We have the exclusive right to sell them.
Please tell me where you will live.
My car was stolen last night.
I'm still a bit sore after my operation.
I agree with you both.
The water in the basin has frozen solid.
"It'll cost about 2,000 yen to repair it."
Is this seat open?
You could count to ten when you were two years old.
It is as if the whole sky were on fire.
My grandfather died when I was a boy.
Are you seeing anyone?

Don't interrupt when people are talking.
Why do black cats have yellow eyes?
"In life, there are many things more important than work."

I'm able to swim across the river.
Did you want anything else?
I hope that Tom doesn't think that we hate him.
I've been waiting for you for ages. Where were you?
She runs a beauty shop.
Do you like to sing?
She can count from one to ten.
Take good care of yourselves.
"If it's OK for her to buy a knife, then why on earth can't I?"
He is commander of our troops.
I washed my hands of the whole business.
There were too many people.
Nobody can get along with such a person.
I think I've met Tom.
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
Let's go to a movie theater.
Tom always worries about his daughter.
What a big pumpkin!
Maybe the snow will melt soon.
"Unfortunately, it's not that simple."
How often do you go swimming?
Tom is extremely rich.
Why didn't you get one before we left?
I'll do that for you for free.
Where did you get this?
Today I fell asleep on the couch.
She got married in her teens.
I'm dizzy.
"Of course, I'll come back."

You should rest after exercise.
Straighten up.
My right shoulder hurts.

Stop your nonsense!
All you have to do is wait.

He had no idea what these words meant.
Tom and I go to the same high school.
This garden is open to the public.
I have three cameras.
Write your answer with a pencil.
"Do you want to buy it? ""Yes."""
I don't think it'll be much of a discount anyhow.
Don't worry about making mistakes.
What a wonderful day!
The doors open automatically.
I heard you two were laughing at me.
"I am near-sighted, so I cannot make out what is written on that signboard."
Why is this?
He accumulated a large fortune.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their dad.
The odds of this team winning are close to zero.
"In all probability, the money will not be paid."
I'm very sorry.
Tom later apologized.
She was making tea.
Is this a duty-free shop?
I teach French to adults.
Which class is Tom in?
"The next morning, the snowman had completely melted."
"Every three months, I get a bonus."
Is the boss in a good mood today?
Are you sure Tom will come?
Fold up your bedding.
I don't believe he's a lawyer.
"Go home, Tom. You're drunk."
Tom was totally wasted.
You may go anywhere you like.
Tom's house has a thatched roof.
He gives me a phone call every now and then.
Why don't we put an ad in the paper?
I entered someone else's room by mistake.
You can sleep late tomorrow morning.
Don't you know I'm going out with Tom?
"Last winter, I went to Canada to ski."
Our team won yesterday.
I don't think that I can eat all this.
May I speak to the professor?
Mary had flowers in her hair.
His mistake was intentional.
Tom turned on the lights.
"If you were forced to sign it, the contract is invalid."
It won't be worth the risk.

What are you concerned about?

He is kind to those around him.
They attract customers by offering high-quality goods.
It isn't so far.
My parent's won't allow me to do that.
We tried to trap the fox.
Just hurry up.
The taxi's here.
I spend less money on clothes than my sister does.
This is a surprising discovery.
Calm down and begin at the beginning.
He was admitted to that school without taking the exam.
I was able to help her.
We have a daughter who is married to a Canadian.
She was very busy.
How's it going? Are you busy?
I wish you wouldn't drive so fast. You're making the baby sick!
This is me eating a banana.
You are early.
I made Tom mad.
Tom is thickheaded.
"Apparently, I got too drunk."
Don't go there anymore.
I love cherry blossoms.
You and I are the same age.
Is anyone hurt?
Tom applied for the job.
I can't understand his feelings.
His shirt was stained with sauce.
I've never eaten couscous.
I had curry last night.
Where are you going all dressed up like that?
I'll never forget how kind you have been.
What was your question?
Tom and Mary went to the moon for their honeymoon.
No sooner had it stopped raining than a beautiful rainbow appeared.
It'll take me a long time to get over my cold.
That's a wonderful idea.
Children grow up really fast.
This is one of the reasons that I like Boston.
Sit down and rest for a while.
I had so little time that I had to eat lunch in a hurry.
What time should I leave the hotel?
Send me your picture.
How do you say that in French?
I plan to go to Boston with Tom.
A good purpose makes hard work a pleasure.
What is in the box?
I think that would help.
I miss Tom.
"You hurt my wife, and I'll kill you."
I borrowed books from the library and read them.
"Anyway, you'll never know."
What's your job?
The recipe is easy.
Can't anything be done?
Brush your teeth well.
Do you think it's going to rain today?

The train was held up for two hours on account of the snowstorm.
She raised her hands.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
It's now your turn.
Tom didn't seem to be as desperate as Mary seemed to be.
His eyes failed him.
Two times seven is fourteen.
I'd like to visit Boston at least one more time before I die.
Do you want to go to a coffee shop?
Tom's suitcase looks heavy.
Do you play soccer?
Be sure to turn off the light when you leave the room.
I have caught a bad cold.
I made Tom mad.
Don't get mixed up with those people.
How on earth did you know that?
Naples is a picturesque city.
Goodbye. See you again tomorrow.
Tom managed a small bar near Boston for quite a few years.
I can't stand her jealousy.
We danced to the music.
My younger sister's husband is older than me.
Tom and Mary are siblings.
The baby looked just like her mother.
She was in the eighth grade.
What's so interesting?
I can't understand this word.
Thank you for your trouble.
He tried to kill himself.
I like this one the best.
The thirty people on board died.
This is the only book that I own.
You can never be too careful.

Who do you like?
Accidents often result from carelessness.
Tom is very conservative.
Everyone froze in horror.
What are you doing for New Year's?
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Do you know much about Tom?
I saw Tom throw something at your dog.
English is a universal language and is used all over the world.
Are we going out again?
The visit to the circus was a big thrill for the children.
Is that a new shirt?
Don't interrupt our conversation.
Tom asked Mary to wash her feet.
These shoes need polishing.
This isn't our problem.
"You never listen, no matter how many times I tell you."
I know Tom is a good detective.
I found him a job.
"If you'd stuck around, you would've had a lot of fun."
We have exams right after summer vacation.
I've been in this church before.
The TV was so loud that I couldn't concentrate on my reading.
Thank you for your trouble.
We're all married women.
Tom doesn't want to work tomorrow.
I saw a man go into that room.
Are you a real nurse?
This book is written in French.
"Check, please."
I can't say for sure.
That movie was shown on TV.
"I've been lucky, I think."
I am working.
You must not eat anything for a few days.
Is that a new car?
I'll never do this again.
Tom is afraid of heights.
Mom is fixing supper now.
Tom is old enough to drive a car.
Few Indians live in Japan.
John's two years older than me.
We do what we want to do.
Can you stop calling me that?
I'm satisfied with everything.
"Believe in your dreams, no matter how impossible they seem."
Were you able to make it to the station on time to catch the first train this morning?
We stayed at a small hotel just outside of town.
Is that a bird?
I figured out how to do that by myself.
I think that Tom will be late.
He lost his balance and fell down.
I haven't worn this tie in almost three years.
I am still attached to this bicycle.
Get up.
That's not necessary.
Read the note at the bottom of the page.
He has a large family.
That makes a lot of sense.
I might be late.
Please copy this.
I don't know anything about that.
How many books can I borrow?
"I'm really good at math, but my English is terrible."
Does the applicant have suitable abilities to carry out the job?
I've decided to stay here.
"When I was a student, I studied three hours every day."
Tom missed an opportunity.
Have you ever tried taking sleeping pills?
My car is covered with pigeon poop.
This is giving me a headache.
Tom suddenly became sick.
I get off here.
A new school building is being built.
The car pulled up in front of the bank.
I've just been to the post office.
I usually shower at night.
What are you going to do about it?
Tom hated Mary.
I wonder why they left my name off the list.
I had to fix the toaster.
This is the last game.
My feet hurt because these shoes are too small.
I translated the document into French.
She likes to cook for her family.
Would you please stop talking for a minute?
The Diet is now in session.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
Classes are starting again soon.
The room is rather small.
Please call me up later.
"If you don't want to go, you don't have to."
The teacher pointed out the student's mistakes.
Tom's family is in Australia.
The horse is a very useful animal.
Don't sell yourself short.
I was caught in a shower on my way home yesterday.
Why do you always do that to me?
Is there any butter in the refrigerator?
I think you've put your sweatshirt on inside out.
He readily agreed to my proposal.
He hasn't come home since he left last week.
The letter was written by Tom.
Why don't we go dancing?

I feel sorry for him.
I bought a pair of boots.
The picture you are looking at is a copy of a Picasso.
It's time for spring cleaning.
I have to solve the problem myself.
A stone does not float.
Come and see this.
I'll bring one more towel.
You've arrived too early.
"I had a headache, and I took the day off today."
Eventually it became quiet.
Who's in the room?

Are you Tom's mother?
He came to see you right after you left.
Write your name here.
Can I open the curtains?
Those records are not accessible to the public.
You must not leave the room.
I forgot my glasses at home.
A nail punctured the tire.
We must start at once.
Tom died in the accident.
Tom wore his best suit to his job interview.
Tom was there yesterday.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Does this bus go to the station?
Would you wipe the table for me?
I wanted to meet and talk with the girl at the window.
The television is broken.
Let me put it in another way.
She handed him his jacket.
I didn't know that Tom was still working here.
What do you usually do on holidays?
I wish you'd told me the truth then.
The sky is blue.
Let's swim.
All of my friends like computer games.
You think too much.
He pressed the brake pedal.
I was up all night.
My grandfather is very fond of reading.
Thanks for helping me.
Tom is an engineer.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
Is this made out of wood or metal?
He receives a high salary.
The game was put off because of rain.
I bought a T-shirt.
Do you know whose handwriting this is?
Be good.

Tom wants to be a pilot.
I think that I know where Tom put his keys.
Tom seldom eats seafood.
Everyone's relieved.
He has a few friends.
The food's here.
Who used to do this?
You rarely smile.
"Is this your first time in Australia? ""Yes, this is my first time here."""
Did both Tom and Mary order coffee?
Tough decisions need to be made.
I forgot to buy a present.
"The party was fun. You should've come, too."
Merry Christmas!
The man robbed her bag.
It wasn't my fault.
The swimming pool is open to the public.
"If Tom is right, then I'm wrong."
You should put safety before everything else.
Will we be in time for the train?
Can I borrow this dictionary?
I'm not in the mood to watch TV right now.
Why not try some of that white wine?
You're a real hard worker.
Let's forget what happened yesterday.
I thought we were supposed to meet Tom at 2:30.
You'll succeed if you try.
Is Tom from Boston?
What color is the roof of your house?
Yesterday's test was easy.
I'm going to see the dentist tomorrow.
I cut myself with a knife.
Put the money in your pocket.
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
"Could I have one more coffee, please?"
Make the most of your vacation.
"He failed in the scheme, much to the disappointment of his father."
It's much cheaper to make it yourself.
Can I help you?
"At home, we only speak French."
The next bus leaves at 2:30.
Are you sure you can handle this by yourself?
How many hours did you sleep last night?
I could tell by the look on Tom's face he knew what was going on.
"What's wrong? ""I don't have a key."""
The imposter was caught.
Take the trash out.
I am afraid I ate something bad.
Are you proud of your country?
He is expected to come home soon.
I caught a cold two days ago.
She was wearing a green coat with a matching mini-skirt.
Please find some hotel where the rates are moderate.
Do you like summer?
When did you notice your wallet was missing?
When can I swim here?
"Tom always sits in that seat over there. Do you know why? It's because it's hard for the teacher to see him there. Look, he's sleeping again."
We miss you very much.
We gave up the plan.
Tom is in his seat.
It takes a long time to master a foreign language.
"If Tom told you that, he was lying."
That was why the city was named Rome.
I have to take off my socks.
I lost no time in doing it.
This is just an estimate.
It is important for everything to be ready by Monday.
"You're pretty good at French, aren't you?"
Can you hear me?
I opened the envelope.
Always keep this dictionary handy.
When will you return home?
Everyone froze in horror.

"Give me another bottle, he said."
Tom had a traffic accident.
Where are you working?
Tom is a friend of mine.

You can see the stars clearly tonight.
Somebody's calling my name.
I just need a minute.
What's the weight of this box?
He made it clear who had said such a thing.
Don't put things here.
Do you want me to hate you?
I would rather live alone in the country.
What time did you go to bed last night?
We're almost like brothers.
An idea came to me.
The strike affected the nation's economy.
I don't know if we have enough money.
School begins in April.
Chances are that he has not heard the news yet.
Tom and Mary built a sand castle on the beach.
It's very stuffy in here.
I was really worried.
It is not a matter to laugh about.
There was a meter of snow after the storm yesterday.
What he said was far from true.
"You must live in the present, not in the past."
That makes me disgusted just to think of it.
It'd be best to think about the problem from a child's perspective.
The Nile is the longest river in the world.
Tom started to climb the ladder.
I do it once a year.
I feel awful.

Do you have relatives abroad?
I don't think that any more students want to come.
I'm eating here for the first time.
I assume that it was Tom's idea.
How many children do you have?
Let's talk again tomorrow.
I became rich.
They took a leap of faith.
Who was this poem written by?
"At that time, I was still not asleep."
The weather is good today.
"Well, you may be right."
I can't see a thing.
I don't think it's strange at all.
Try it out.
Tom had instant ramen for lunch.
Where is your school?
She always has to be the one giving orders.
"Tom is really popular, isn't he?"
He believed in the truth.
Tom is a cop.
It's time to get up.
We express our thoughts by means of language.
He died when he was 54 years old.

Absence of rain caused the plants to die.
Was Tom able to find what he was looking for?
Tom wore a parka.
The boys were completely covered in mud.
He had his tooth pulled.

Tom set up a website for Mary.
It's my belief that knowledge is power.
Who's that guy?
I'm a night owl.
The old man was almost hit by a car.
When did you go to sleep?
Look at that.
Come with us.
I know the trick.
"Excuse me, but would you please tell me the way to the post office?"
I think you're correct.
Communists took power in China in 1949.
How far away is Tom's house?
Thank you for being born.
How could I ever forget you?
It is strange that he should say so.
You've made only a few spelling mistakes.
I am not alone in this opinion.
I'll visit a museum today.
We must keep up with the times.
All right. I'll accept your offer.
"If you fall off that bridge, it'll be almost impossible to rescue you."
I've drunk way too much coffee today.
It took me three hours to do my homework.
It was so mystical.
Tom doesn't remember what happened last night.
Do as you're told to do.
I agree with Tom a hundred percent.
That play was popular.
I'm not sure anymore.
What did Tom bring with him?
"After getting out of the shower, Tom wiped the fog off the mirror and shaved."
Why don't we take a little break?
Where do you think Tom bought his motorcycle?
What is the book about?
I didn't think Tom would be able to help us.
She was heard playing the violin.
I ate it because I was hungry.
Tom isn't vegan.
That isn't true.
It's on the eighth floor.
This is too expensive.
I feel like throwing up.
This intense heat doesn't seem to bother you.
I feel spring in the air.
They're useless now.
I hate people like Tom.
Now I'll add the finishing touch.
I predicted this.
I was talking about mushrooms.
It was apparent that he did not understand what I had said.
"Tom, I think you should eat more."
We have no chance against those top players.
"You can come, too."
Are you going to be at this afternoon's meeting?
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
I prefer swimming to skiing.
His life was a long series of failures.
She has been dead for ten years.
I promise that I'll be back soon.
Can I use your computer?
How's life in Boston?
We all know who did that.
Mary is too young for me anyway.
Was anyone in the next room?
Let's have lunch.
Give me back my cap.
"He went to London, where he stayed for a week."
"I can't walk fast, but I can walk for a long time."
That sounds like a scam.
Do you really think that you're fooling anybody?
Some wild animals are on the verge of extinction.
Tom put a star on top of the Christmas tree.
Did you lock all the doors?
Tom is doing the dishes.
Can you speak French?
You can stop now.

What are you doing?
He is absent from school today.
I've never eaten horse meat.
We took turns driving.
I need to be home on Monday.
How did you do on your biology test?
Can you tell which is the copy?
Can I have the paper when you're finished with it?
The letter is for me.
Are you hot?
May we go now?
It makes no difference to me whether you are rich or poor.
The fever has abated.
Tom didn't ask for our opinions.
I have two sons. One is in Boston and the other is in Chicago.
I don't want to attend the party.
She showed me around the campus.
We talked over the plan with him.
The police have blocked off the area.
It was worth the effort.
You're special.
I switched off the TV.
Get out of the classroom.
I can't get along with him.
We need to talk about what to do.
Thanks for the cookie.
Is Tom planning on doing that anytime soon?
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
I can't believe Tom left without saying goodbye.
I want to get off here.
He cured my illness.
I'm having lunch with my sister right now.
Please tell me the secret to making good jam.
She picked out a pink shirt for me to try on.
May I eat?
She has a great affection for her parents.
I have other plans today.
The download is complete.
It wasn't anyone's fault.
Tom's house has a beautiful marble staircase.
I try to read at least a few pages a day.
How was the trip?
He regained consciousness in the hospital.
My head hurt.
Tell me which you want.
Most computers made today are equipped with multi-core processors.
He wasn't able to attend the party.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
I can speak English a little.
Tom didn't want to go any further.
Take all the time you need.
How do you spell your last name?
He will get well soon.
Where's the loo?
Come and see me the day after tomorrow.
"What were you doing, Dad?"
Is today payday?
My favorite sport is skiing.
Is there a bank near here?
I knew right away that it was you.
It's not an impossible request.
We've lost 3 to 0.
The kite got caught in the tree.
Tom bought this house thirty years ago.
I give my children an allowance.
We walked to the river.
The train was delayed for two hours because of the heavy snow.
Tom said you speak French.
Are you sure you locked the doors?
Tom was daydreaming.
The unrest lasted three days.
"You don't have a key, do you?"
This is the beginning of a new era.
Tom just took a chance and called Mary to ask her out.
Sit here.
I'm now about as tall as my father.
I'm here to help Tom.
There's no soap.
I have to go.
"I like Tom, but I don't love him."
He was very busy all day.
There are more clouds today than there were yesterday.
Can I ask you a question?
How about going for a walk after lunch?
He has gone to America.
To lose face means to be humiliated.
Tom is three centimeters shorter than me.
I don't see Tom much.
Doing that was harder than I expected.
"Some people went by bus, and others by train."
Please come with me.
I wasn't able to sleep last night.
The typhoon gathered strength.
Did you really do this?
I don't care if I die.
The door is open. I'll go and shut it.
I haven't read your letter yet.
Tom is a clever kid.
Don't touch my bike.
You shouldn't go there.
I called the police.
I have to buy a new computer.
"Did you say something, Tom?"
Relax.
"That's very interesting, isn't it?"
He started a new life.
I have nothing to declare.
"Judging from the look of the sky, it is going to snow."
Whose coat is this?
We came dangerously close to freezing to death.
We do what we want.
There is a connection between smoking and lung cancer.
She has a good command of French.
My mother will attend to the baby while I go to the dance.
Tom has already gone home.
Please read page ninety-four.
I think they're pretty.
We have six lessons a day.
He was lying on his back.
"Look, there's a rabbit!"
I would suggest the following change.
You seem to be in good spirits.
These grapes are seedless.
Mary is Tom's fiancée.
I like my last name.
Tom made his choice.
The lake is a long way from here.
Such an old car was next to useless.
I had no time to eat.
How long have you been in here?
I ought to go.
You may open the window.
You don't say.
I've finished all my homework.
Each question has only one correct answer.
He is outgoing.
He mailed a letter home.
Everyone is against me.
Are you sure you know how to do this?
Sit down with me.
You'll get lost.
Is there any food you don't like?
All is well with me.
Icicles hung from the roof.
I will have been to the States three times if I go there again.
My father took his place at the head of the table.
Bring me my glasses.
Bring me some cold water.
I had him repair my watch.
Tom is a bit small for his age.
When does school start?
Are you ready to leave?
Tom seemed glad that Mary was there.
We had a great time.
Why do you have such a big mouth?
"Open the window, will you?"
You're in a good mood today. Did something nice happen?
This ticket is non-exchangeable and non-refundable.
The chair is broken. You'd better get someone to fix it.
It looks like it may rain.
How can you do the same thing every day?
He accidentally hit his thumb with the hammer.
"Since my mother was sick, I stayed home from school."
Someone has died.
Have any of you been to Australia?
Let's go tomorrow afternoon.
I can't get rid of this headache.
Stop teasing Tom.
He is related to the family.
You don't have to be so nervous.
This work has to be finished by Monday.
Tom couldn't control his anger.
I wish you the best of luck.
Tom was wearing a camouflage jacket.
Kids grow up so fast.
He turned a deaf ear to their complaints.
This is the worst storm in ten years.
"Why did you do that? ""Because I felt like it."""
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
We can't let Tom in on this.
Tom phoned Mary.
You don't need to go.
Tom and his friends use the school printer every month to print the student bulletin.
Do you like fish?
She doesn't have many friends in this town.
I bought what you wanted.
It was worth the time.
"So far, he has been extremely happy."
What would you do if you had ten thousand dollars?
It's very uncomfortable.
I didn't go to school because I was sick.
"Both brothers said that they couldn't support both a wife and an airplane, so they spent their lives as bachelors."
Your work is far from being satisfactory.
It was completely dark in the cave.
I'll pick you up tomorrow after work.
Tom didn't need to buy that book.
His eyes were blazing with anger.
I used to have an old Rolls Royce.
I can't allow you to do that.
"You're not a mechanic, are you?"
How does Tom know about that?
The front door remained locked.
Is Monday OK?
Did you remember to lock the windows?
They say you should use your imagination.
Strawberries are in season at the moment.
"I could go on, but I don't want to bore you."
Where has the money gone?
Thank you for the gift.
I don't think her story is true.
I had my bicycle repaired yesterday.
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
Why didn't you call anyone?
You have to get enough sleep.
I want to know the reason why.
I want to hug you.
Stop bothering Tom.
He mentioned to me that he would go shopping in Shibuya.
I can't wait for Christmas.
"If get a chance, I'd like to try it again."
The fire got out of control.
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
I'm chicken.
He's a handsome young man.
My father died at the age of forty-nine.
I only eat kosher food.
That's a great plan.
I was happy to hear the news.
"When I'm hot, a glass of cool water really refreshes me."
I drank the wine.
Why did you do that?
I found a good place.
I see that dog almost every day.
The children want candy.
Do you have any questions about the food?
I want a new tennis racket.
Tom just wants to leave.
That tour already has a waiting list.
I thought I was dreaming.
You're on the wrong train.
I saw you with a tall boy.
Can you swim underwater?
Tom passed away three years ago.
It isn't just a pen.
Do you often go to town?
All I did today was play games.
This bike needs to be repaired.
Please remember what I tell you.
Was that too much?
I've already started.
The dog was frozen to death.
She came to Tokyo at the age of 18.
"No, no! That's not right."
Might I ask your name?
The factory was shut down ten years ago.
Do I need to leave immediately?
May I ask you for your name?
I'll do everything I can to help.
Tom doesn't know how to cook.
I'd like to say a few words by way of apology.
I arrived last night.
Last night I had a weird dream.
I'm sorry. That's really all I remember.
Were all your children born in Australia?
I'll stay at home if it rains tomorrow.
Tom is going to Boston on business next week.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
There wasn't any furniture in that room.
Our plane took off exactly at 6 p.m.
About how many hours does it take by car?
I'm not sure that I can do it.
Tom doesn't like chess.
"When I got home, my mother and father were fighting."
"You're going to do that today, aren't you?"
Let's continue the game after lunch.
She was killed in an automobile accident.
I have heard nothing from him.
Are you free tomorrow morning?
Can't you swim at all?
The whole town knows about it.
I heard you singing.
The enemy attack ceased at dawn.
They say that he was very poor when he was young.
He talks as though he knew everything.
How was your trip?
She substituted margarine for butter.
I want this camera.
Why is Tom not here today?
It's dangerous here.
Where's everybody?
There is going to be a storm.
It was almost noon.
Tom left just after Mary left.
I know that you're there.
Tom got his pants dirty.
This car is very economical on gas.
Nothing beats a cold beer in the summer.
This sounds very interesting.
Tom took his clothes off and put on his pajamas.
Is that true?
We've known each other since childhood.
We decided to lie hidden for a few days.
Your behavior is creating a lot of problems.
I can't tell Tom from his brother.
Our class has forty-five students.
Only a few of my friends can speak French.
Can Tom help us?
Don't be late for work.
Tom died in an airplane accident.
I love fresh bread.
What'll you tell Tom?
She was in a hurry to go home.
"Not only can she speak French, she can also speak English."
Sorry for calling you so early.
I am thankful for my friends.
A is the first letter of the alphabet.
Novels aren't being read as much as they were in the past.
Didn't you know Tom was older than Mary?
That isn't my cup of tea.
The ice is thick enough to walk on.
Tom is probably with Mary right now.
I can make nothing of it.
You're correct.
We left the final decision to him.
Where can I pick up my ticket?
I forgot to phone him.
Please take your seat.
Did you really not know that?
I will miss you all.
Did I say you could use my phone?
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
Do you think you can come?
This curry is very hot.
Are you cold?
She didn't answer.
Start with the basics.
The dam burst owing to the heavy rain.
He's proud of being good at mathematics.
That's why I came late.
Please close the door.
Fire burns.
Your initial order is subject to a special discount of 5%.
I read the whole book in a day.
We all went home together.
Ten years have gone by.
We want to know the truth.
It's a common mistake.
That house is vacant now.
Call me at six tomorrow morning.
I often wear sunglasses when I'm driving.
This is all I want to say.
He turned around.
I spend a lot of time studying French.
"I don't know if you remember me, but we met a couple of years ago in Boston."
You'll catch a cold.
Calm down.
Call me anytime.
Give me a hug.
She married a musician.
My first day of college was pretty boring.
Can you call a taxi for me?
I don't want to cause anyone any more trouble.
That tower you see over there is the Eiffel Tower.
Tom and Mary are brother and sister.
I just bought a new pair of shoes.
Just sit there and don't say anything.
Tom was the one who pushed Mary down the stairs.
I never thought that it'd be this hard to build a picnic table.
"Tom, listen to me!"
I enjoy playing chess.
I am married and have two children.
You two stay here.
Will you wait a moment?
What a beautiful town!
This book has many pictures.
"If I do that, I'll be laughed at."
I'm extremely tired.
Tom lost the sight in one of his eyes in a traffic accident.
Please put some candles on the birthday cake.
"If you're going to the beach, you need sunscreen."
I had wanted to catch the first train.
I'm very busy this week.
I'll drop if I don't sit down.
He is lying on the sofa.
Eat it before it gets cold.
I love being alone.
Tom is faster than me.
What language is it?
You've lied to me before.
May I use this cup?
I have to return this book to the library.
Do you want to go somewhere?
We're teachers.
I don't think Tom will notice.
I bought the car at a 10% discount.
Tom died in his sleep three years ago.
I'm a slow learner.
My foot fell asleep.
Can't you hear the sound?
"Since there was no taxi, I had to walk home."
When did you buy this car?
I have a spare key to my house hidden outside.
"You're kidding me, right?"
Tom is a good driver.
How do I get to the beach?
Scientists haven't found a cure for cancer yet.
Call me if you need help.
It's too late.
"Since she got her braces, I've hardly seen her smile."
I won't complain about that.
"Mary is very good at math, isn't she?"
I only have 100 yen on me.
May I join you on your walk?
Tom buys and sells used cars.
Nothing is as difficult as coming up with a simple explanation for something difficult.
The door blew shut.
Where is the notebook that I left here on the table yesterday?
I can walk to school in half an hour.
You're carrying your joke a bit too far.
Now I'm wide awake.
He's intelligent.
My father smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.
I plan to spend the New Year's holiday in Australia.
I really like that dress.
Some animals will not breed when kept in cages.
Who's the girl Tom is talking to?
Eat whatever you like.
He showed us some pictures.
There are many small restaurants and cafés in this area.
Shame on you for getting so flustered. You looked ridiculous.
This house is very spacious.
He's out of his mind with pain.
"You made the mistake on purpose, didn't you?"
Did you brush your teeth?
Tom neither reads nor writes.
The cat caught the rats.
My socks are still damp.
It isn't cold in the house.
I saw Tom crying.
The price will increase.
Tom didn't give up.
My computer froze again.
I can't stand this pain.
Have you finished doing your homework yet?
Parents are usually concerned about their children's future.
Are you home alone?
I can't leave work until five o'clock.
School starts next Monday.
I don't have the slightest idea.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
Where is my car?
Eat whatever you want.
The rain's stopped. Let's go for a walk.
She didn't reply.
I think Tom was impressed with your work.
Is it OK if I open a can?
This box is empty. It has nothing in it.
Is Tom afraid?
"I'll go to the university tomorrow, too."
Can I open the windows?
Tom denied killing Mary.
This lion is very tame.
She was busy doing her hair.
I have a fever and I ache all over.
I don't think that Tom will mind.
Tom is learning English.
Why don't we bake some cookies?
Tom is preparing supper.
Tom is still home.
Tom ran away.
I bought that record in this store.
I do not agree with you at all.
Tom and Mary seem happy.
You can't always win.
I prefer riding a bike to walking.
We took it for granted that he would join us.
Who is your favorite actor?
I'd like to invite you to the party.
I had my bicycle repaired yesterday.
Lightning struck the train Tom was riding on.
His secretary flatly denied leaking any confidential information.
"You wouldn't hit me, would you?"
What does he plan to do?
How is Tom doing?
I'll show you around town.
Once again.
I think you'd better take an umbrella in case it rains.
I saw the girl swimming in the river.
That's my aim.
Help me move it.
Tom said he thought that I might not win.
Mary is interested in politics.
This flower is the most beautiful.
I couldn't understand that explanation.
Don't be angry.
Let's stop talking and start working.
My mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
She's going to have a baby.
I think it's strange that she was absent from school.
Let me think about it.
I had no work yesterday.
3 times 5 is 15.
I didn't wash my hair.
Is there a speed limit?
Tom never laughs.
I enjoyed the voyage across the Pacific.
It's about two miles.
I got on the wrong bus.
How can I get my toddler to eat vegetables?
They really seem to dislike spinach.
Tom fell off his bicycle and injured himself.
I studied French last night.
Don't forget to take an umbrella with you.
I didn't have the courage to tell her the fact.
Turn up the TV.
"I was unable to attend the party, nor did I want to."
The atomic number of uranium is 92.
Let's start as soon as he comes.
Both my father and I went to the museum for the first time.
He works for a bank.
Words failed me at the last minute.
I thought you were going to talk to Tom about that.
I thought I told you not to call Tom at school.
I go to school.
The last time I ate at that restaurant the food wasn't very good.
I'll be on a business trip next week.
The sun went behind the clouds.
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
"Our teacher is really stubborn, isn't she?"
Did Tom seem busy?
My father isn't at home.
I hate karaoke.
It can't be mended.
Tom left his parents' house this spring and has been living alone since then.
Tom is very mad.
"I looked all around, but I could see nobody there."
Everyone is afraid of you.
I made a paper plane.
There was an accident at the intersection.
Tom had never been to Boston.
Please conserve water during the summer.
Thank you for all you've done.
I'd like to buy Tom a piggy bank.
I've been here too long.
I envy her.
I looked down on Mt. Fuji from the window of the plane.
"I used to drink a lot of cola, but now I only drink water."
Your help is vital to the success of our plan.
Tom doesn't have to go to school anymore.
I usually walk.
I need a suitcase. Could I borrow one of yours?
This is something I have to do.
My heart ached.
I just wanted to say thanks.
What do you think I want?
The teacher called the roll.
I don't think that I'll pass this exam.
We're old friends.
Tom might not be hungry.
Tom always sleeps hugging his teddy bear.
Let's forget about what happened today.
Are you still afraid?
Ten prisoners broke out of jail.
Stop the car.
Every rose has its thorns.
He is old enough to drive a car.
His new movie is disappointing.
Ten divided by five is two.
Let me take you home.
"All the members of our club, excluding me, are men."
This story is based on actual events.
There's a full moon tonight.
Forewarned is forearmed.
A stranger seized me by the arm.
I can't reach the top shelf.
I came to Japan last year.
Tom and Mary had lunch together.
Let's make a snowman later.
"Will it stop raining soon? ""I'm afraid not."""
Is it OK to go home now?
I go to the library from time to time.
It's going to rain tomorrow.
The car is in the garage.
What were you doing about this time yesterday?
Enjoy yourself.
"You aren't very good at cooking, are you?"
I have not seen much of him recently.
I listen to music.
My mother loves music.
She likes blue dresses.
Five minutes' walk brought us to the park.
Please promise me that you will never tell a lie again.
Did you see my camera?
I haven't been to work. I've stayed at home all day.
This is the house where my father was born and raised.
Do you prefer reading to cards?
The war began in 1941.
It will not be long before man can travel to the moon.
Don't stay around here.
She didn't even try to help.
What do you want for your birthday?
How's the wife?
I caught a beautiful butterfly.
We eat soup with a spoon.
"Could you do the dishes, please?"
I'm still the same person I used to be.
I'm having fun.
I'm having a blast.
We have no children.
There's an easier way to do it.
I'm going to my friend's place.
My father gives my mother all of his salary.
The rumor was completely without foundation.
"It's a pain, but we have to do it."
Is everybody ready?
She didn't give me my money back.
Her English was surprisingly good.
You shouldn't have told him about the plan.
Where's the nearest train station?
Tom and Mary have known each other since they were children.
I know some students in that school.
I have low blood pressure.
He was afraid of the dark.
It's been three years since I moved here.
"A coke, please."
Today I fell asleep on the couch.
Tom heard a strange noise.
I have enough sandwiches for everybody.
He stood out because he was wearing a suit.
Please click here.
She had never dreamed of meeting him abroad.
Where are your umbrellas?
Is everything OK?
I understand your concerns.
Thanks for bringing me here.
He stood all by himself.
We're not interested in such details.
He lived abroad for much of his life.
Do you like to play badminton?
Why are you so ugly?
"Give me the bill, please."
I bought a six-pack of beer on my way home from work.
There were only six people at the party.
"If you want to go, go. If you don't want to, that's OK, too."
I always think of my father when I look at this picture.
I'd like to buy a rice cooker.
I've only dated one Canadian.
"From now on, try harder."
Please call him.
Japan's exports exceeded imports by $77.8 billion in 1998.
I found the perfect place.
"If you were forced to sign it, the contract is invalid."
I've never heard English spoken so quickly.
Where is the bathroom?
"When I heard that song, it reminded me of when I was a kid."
Drink something.
It's stopped raining.
"We are on the same page, aren't we?"
Let's pass by the church.
Who does the gun belong to?
Kindly refrain from smoking.
Tom didn't want to work with Mary.
We should abolish the death penalty.
Who'd like another piece of cake?
"If you don't want to come, you don't have to."
I had my thirtieth birthday last week.
Tom was welcome wherever he went.
Please come here.
The money belongs to the company.
I guess we could.
My father came home at nine.
Did you have a good weekend?
I'm busy all day today.
Should that matter?
I was cheated by Tom.
Tom is still mad at Mary.
Can you tell me exactly what you want to do?
She lived in Hiroshima until she was ten.
I passed all my exams.
Who was Tom planning to go swimming with?
I still have a lot of questions that I want to ask you.
The early bird catches the worm.
Tom has a good memory.
I have to make a call.
Tom often makes careless mistakes.
You're a liar.
Tom would be a good teacher.
It's my job.
You have lots of friends.
My arm is broken.
No one has been able to reach the top of the mountain.
Why do you come here every day?
That job is just about done.
The car battery has run down.
Ghosts exist.
"One mile is approximately 1,600 meters."
Don't slam the door.
It's as easy as pie.
Why did you lie?
I just read this book.
I think Tom is smart.
Tom gave me this hat for my birthday.
I'm glad that Tom is safe now.
I didn't know you were such a good cook.
It's probably just food poisoning.
I went to the airport by taxi.
Tom took off his socks.
Tom is illogical.
Was it an earthquake?
Life is often compared to a journey.
Let's pick flowers from the garden.
Are you good at reading maps?
The train was about to leave the station.
"In case of an emergency, what number should I call?"
Tom shut the door.
Could you let me know when Tom gets here?
It would be better not to go alone.
I fixed my computer.
I want to ask you a favor.
Did you enjoy the game?
The door would not open.
Tom can play the guitar and is also good at singing.
I'm surprised that you're so naive.
Tom isn't a weakling.
He was sent to prison.
He likes soccer a lot.
Who's the person sitting at the other end of the table?
I couldn't get a definite answer from him.
I thought you grew up in Boston.
Enjoy the flight.
I'm afraid of getting lost at the airport.
"I can't find my key, but it has to be somewhere around here."
She pointed her finger at him.
Thanks for the gift.
This book isn't as heavy as that book.
Don't you have anything smaller than this?
Tom never fails to send a birthday present to his father.
It's all in a day's work.
Tom went to his high school reunion last week.
Some animals will not breed when kept in cages.
She asked him not to leave her alone.
They stopped talking.
She displayed her talents.
Did you make a list of things that you want to buy?
Stop picking on Tom.
That's a good question.
I ordered a beer.
We were totally exhausted from the five-hour trip.
My father bought me a bicycle.
Who do you think the author of this novel is?
This dog bites.
He is at his desk.
You're way too good for Tom.
Won't you sit down?
How was your meeting?
Some countries don't recognize same-sex marriages.
Let's pick Tom up.
"Are you hungry? ""I'm always hungry."""
Why did Tom not do that?
He kept singing.
Tom is alone again.
I wish I could live in Boston.
I just want you to come.
I fell down on the ice.
I don't have time to read books.
I wish you had come to see me yesterday.
There's a box inside the box.
How long will we have to wait?
Tom is stuttering.
How much does a case of beer cost?
You must prepare for the worst.
I have many colleagues.
Are you still good at baseball?
There is very little water in the glass.
It's no use arguing with him.
Is it made of iron?
How about the taste?
I can't recall her name at the moment.
Do you have everything?
She despises him.
I think Boston is very beautiful.
"Could you break a 1,000 yen note?"
I'm going to build a doghouse for Cookie.
She lives with him.
I'm living with my parents.
May I ask your name?
I can see his hand in this.
Just as I thought.
I became furious.
Let's get ready for lunch.
He is hated.
Are you fond of baseball?
Keep on working.
Is it true you called Tom last night?
Tom carefully locked the door.
What time will you be leaving?
Please sit wherever you like.
It's difficult to prove that ghosts exist.
Are you good at cooking?
This will cost €30.
Were you at Tom and Mary's wedding?
Is it safe to eat food that has dropped on the floor?
Have you already bought a ticket?
I'm tired of you guys.
She divided the cake between the two.
Tom demonstrated how to core an apple.
Is everyone ready?
Do they have something like a compass?
Is that why you were late?
That's really sad.
I prefer going out to staying at home.
They want to better their working conditions.
"Where are my cookies? ""Sorry, I ate them all."""
I turned in my report yesterday.
That's absolutely right.
Why are you so mad?
Let's go somewhere warm.
I didn't go out at all because you told me not to.
I often make mistakes when speaking in French.
I don't know where we'll live next year.
Only the strong will survive.
All of the buses are full.
Is it OK is I eat this orange?
Is this water okay to drink?
We're very similar.
Thanks for watching Tom today.
"Write with a pen, not with a pencil."
She was run over by the car.
My father is a teacher.
I bought it for 10 dollars.
There were a lot of cars.
Tom took out a magazine and began reading.
I got my hair cut.
I can't believe you kissed Tom.
Be sure to hand in your homework by tomorrow.
How much did you pay for those?
Tom and John are identical twins and often wear matching clothes.
I did it.
Is Tom really going to go to Boston by himself?
It's windy.
Tom asked for more money.
Same-sex marriage is legal here.
Our eyes met.
She looked sad.
The patient's condition changes from day to day.
Enjoy your holidays.
Tom is good at cooking.
Nothing is the matter with me.
I'm really grateful to you.
"Look, Tom is on TV."
Did the policeman say anything to you?
I overslept.
He comes round once a week.
I like my brandy straight.
May I use this pencil?
He doesn't seem to be an American.
Those are Tom's parents.
Your nose is bleeding.
"The radius of Earth is about 6,000 kilometers."
That snake is very dangerous.
Here is your book.
"Although Tom is rich, he's not happy."
This is as good as any.
Can you explain how this machine works?
I must calculate how much money I'll spend next week.
"No, I don't think so."
Are you saying that you don't know how to do this?
"It's raining, but we'll go anyway."
I bought a new car.
What led you to believe so?
I'll give you a present.
I'd like a bus route map.
I crossed the equator for the first time on my trip to Australia.
Tom is out shoveling snow.
Have you seen my striped sweater?
I didn't have enough money to buy Tom a present.
That saved me a lot of time.
I wonder who made all this.
I can't contact Tom.
We pitched our tents before it got dark.
Go straight down this road.
Which of you was here first?
Did they find anything?
Let me introduce myself.
I should've brought an umbrella.
I can't drive a car.
What is the population of India?
Tom and Mary are exactly the same weight.
"Is the essay ready? ""No, I'm sorry. I haven't finished writing it yet."""
Can you identify which coat is yours?
The book is on the table.
Write a thank-you note when someone goes out of his or her way to help you.
Don't be afraid. It's just me.
Do you know what I mean?
How much is this ballpoint pen?
When will the next World Cup take place?
Make it a little larger.
I would rather stay at home than go out.
The room started to spin after I drank too much.
I thought that it'd get easier.
"On last week's English test, my score was worse than hers."
Why are you so smart?
Why don't we give Tom a little time?
"Where there's a will, there's a way."
Hold the ball with both hands.
No one expects us to win.
May I ask a couple of questions?
I think that we should reduce the price.
Your wife is here.
Get it done as soon as possible.
"How far is it from here to your school? ""It's about ten minute's walk."""
It's a robot.
You should take it easy.
Look at that building.
"When I was sixteen, I played tennis for the first time."
I always knew one day this would happen.
Does this book belong to you?
He's not the kind of person who finds fault with others.
Tom thinks it's impossible for Mary to break the record.
I need to know by tomorrow.
I bought a pair of gloves.
You'd better not drive a car.
Take this.
It's time the kids went to bed.
Please tell me how to fill out the disembarkation card.
I want a boyfriend.
He has a good brain.
Are both Tom and Mary still living in Boston?
It took me three years to write this book.
We have a holiday today.
No one came except Mary.
His story was too ridiculous for anyone to believe.
What bands do you like?
How's job hunting going?
You should leave it for tomorrow.
Tom bought two copies of the book.
Tom looks happy today.
It's been five years since we moved here.
That is a pencil.
Keep the change.
I hate the way I look.
Are you sure you don't want some juice?
What's your favorite fruit?
The goods were transported by ship.
"Please be quiet, everybody."
I feel like a drink.
Tom usually takes a walk every morning before breakfast.
I can't stand that noise anymore.
I never eat meat.
"Mother, having thought about it carefully, I don't feel I should marry him."
The rabbit hid behind the tree.
You may come at any time tomorrow afternoon.
Help me write this report.
Everybody says I look like my father.
Is it foggy?
Where do you want to go?
Thanks for keeping me in your thoughts.
Will you tell me the way to the station?
There was nothing to worry about.
What's she doing?
Tom had an accident at work.
I should read more.
Does Tom have any pets?
I'm very thirsty.
I really spoke too harshly.
I put the money into the safe.
Tom only speaks French.
I'd rather you came tomorrow than today.
I thought that was your job.
You don't need to wrap it.
I didn't know Tom was planning to move to Australia.
Please give me one 80-yen stamp.
This handwriting is illegible.
I bought this book for 300 yen.
Watch yourself.
"Having been caught in that situation before, I knew exactly what to do."
Am I the only one?
See you in the morning.
The pen I lost yesterday was a new one.
There are three beauty salons on this street.
I was reading a book all morning.
Cats can see things even when it's dark.
That's an old magazine.
Were you talking about me?
I've told you so a hundred times.
The books I bought are on the desk.
Where is the nearest lost and found?
This is my bag.
Whether she agrees or not is the question.
Both his sisters are beautiful.
I wasn't hungry.
Does Tom have long hair?
I spent a month in Japan on holiday and it was fantastic.
We have arrived.
The weather forecast said that there'd be rain all week.
I've decided not to live in Boston.
All of us like you very much.
Shall I draw a map for you?
Are you off duty tonight?
The old cottage has a certain charm about it.
Don't do anything hasty.
Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic drink.
"Will they go on strike again? ""I'm afraid so."""
I sent my mother a letter yesterday.
My laptop's stopped working.
Tom ought to be able to win.
Are you new here?
Tom doesn't get along with most people in the office.
"You're good at speaking French, aren't you?"
What sport do you like best?
I know nothing about it.
Tom was trying hard not to laugh out loud.
This is much tastier than what Tom usually makes.
The batter was out.
Is there a tour guide available?
Bring your brother.
How expensive is it?
I know that you've been avoiding me.
I'll get this bag for you.
I'm sure they're on their way.
I've decided to weigh myself every day starting today.
Tom likes to listen to music while he's studying.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
It's empty.
She kicked the door.
You have the wrong number.
Is there a service charge for that?
"Personally, I don't like it."
Tom doesn't want my help.
I've been teaching French for three years.
I'm a Japanese teacher.
This book is really old.
He is bound to succeed.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
We don't know anything about Tom.
I found this book interesting.
Listen to this!
Try and do it.
There are many exchange students in this school.
We have nothing to complain about.
May we leave our suitcases here?
This app is very useful.
I'm out of my mind.
I still have difficulty in making myself understood in French.
She bowed to me politely.
I'll be along soon.
I thought you hated Christmas.
I didn't catch any fish.
This plate is dirty.
All the world desires peace.
"I don't have much time, so I'm going to drop in at a fast-food restaurant."
I've never played soccer before.
This is a joke.
Thanks a bunch.
I haven't met Tom yet.
I feel kind of sorry for Tom.
"If you wish to speak to Tom, you'll need to wait about three hours."
Is this what you want me to carry?
Don't swim in that pond.
I can't swim at all.
We were married five years ago today.
Do you really think Tom would help us?
I baked some cupcakes.
Final exams are two weeks from now.
Flowers are always acceptable.
"You're a student here, aren't you?"
Tom should have gone to the dentist yesterday.
Eat as much as you like.
What are you thinking?
Are you done with work?
You can stay if you want.
My six-month old son is teething.
I am very interested in French.
Would you like some ham for breakfast?
Get out of here before Tom finds you.
Are you mad at me?
"Even if you don't feel like eating, you should eat something. If you don't, you won't last until lunch time."
She listens to him.
I thought you were still studying French.
I'm good at mathematics.
"Since I will see him tomorrow, I can give him a message if you want."
See you then.
She painted the walls white.
It's about time you went to school.
Tom went to Boston alone.
The bee flew out the window.
I'm interested in palm reading.
Tom's eyes are blue.
Tom still writes to me from time to time.
This isn't a real diamond.
I thought I heard the door open.
This is an abacus.
Can I buy you a drink?
Tom and Mary live in a quiet residential neighborhood.
They will agree on that.
I don't really get it.
I know I'm missing something. I just don't know what.
I would rather starve than start stealing.
Have you recently changed your soap or laundry detergent?
His object is to pass the test.
Quite a few students are absent today.
I'm getting off at the next station.
Tom doesn't eat much.
A serious epidemic has broken out in Beijing.
The sky brightened.
I intend to try.
Don't make me go.
I don't write letters often.
I'll carry this bag for you.
Tom is a man you can rely on.
Tom is a very smart boy.
That's what I want to say.
We enjoyed singing songs together.
Where's the butter?
That TV station only broadcasts movies.
I'm good at languages.
"I have a fever, so I'll be leaving early."
He is kind.
"I wanted to go, too."
I can speak French.
Put it in the corner.
Are you about ready?
Drive carefully.
May we enter?
I don't like eating ice cream in the winter.
Did you grade the tests?
I'm thirsty. Please give me a cold drink.
I'll be taking a vacation next month.
You must not be late for school.
I wonder who the people I saw Tom with were.
I raised my hand to ask a question.
I have a headache.
My little brother gets delirious when he's sleepy. He says the weirdest things.
"Where do you live? ""I live in Tokyo."""
Please come home as quickly as possible.
Wolves usually don't attack people.
He adopted the orphan.
He's eligible for the presidency.
The man went out of his way to take me to the station.
He acknowledged me by lifting his hat.
Please come after 2:30.
I had no breakfast this morning.
The city is beautiful at night.
Please send the book by mail.
The children are playing with toys.
One out of three people in this city owns a car.
"You don't like it, do you?"
He said that he would be back right away.
Go buy some green peas — the frozen kind.
The bus was awfully crowded.
You should've told me you needed money.
She didn't need to come.
Please take care of my dog while I'm away.
The cherry blossoms are at their best.
I'm not going to waste my money.
The kids are growing up really fast.
I have two brothers.
She gave me a smile of recognition.
You can't sell it.
I've been waiting a long time.
Tom is around my age.
I guess that we're out of luck.
He should be back any minute now.
Get on the scales.
"If I were Tom, I would've punched Mary in the face."
I have something to take care of.
Are Tom and John brothers?
"If you do that, you're doing exactly what they want you to do."
May I use your phone?
He has more books than I do.
This is weird.
She especially likes music.
Tom takes care of Mary.
My neighbor's dog often comes into my yard.
He woke up to find himself lying on a bench in the park.
That's pretty normal.
I'd like to get off at Fifth Avenue.
I thought that you were dating Tom.
That's what I need.
Please give me a hand.
I know what's wrong.
I think they're both good.
They were all sold out.
I know him better than anybody.
Tom owns a bar.
"He's handsome and nice, but he has no class."
My association with them didn't last long.
Every rose has its thorns.
You've spilled your coffee.
I have a lot of things to do today.
Who's absent?
She got out of the car.
He somehow managed to swim across the river.
Tom likes Italian food.
I'd like to learn French.
The basement is flooded.
Who's the goalkeeper?
"You've read the report, haven't you?"
Tom doesn't talk with anyone.
I've finished my homework.
Cranes are big beautiful birds.
I learned how to ride a motorcycle when I was sixteen years old.
I hate waiting.
She must have finished the work yesterday.
What are you two doing?
Tom is cleaning the toilet.
I'm afraid he won't be here until 1:00.
Give it to her.
There was never this much snow before.
Please fill in your name and address on this form.
I won't be home tomorrow.
I'm not that surprised.
He is playing outdoors.
The travelers stayed at a seaside hotel.
I lost.
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
Can I buy concert tickets here?
Eating too much may lead to sickness.
He looks very sleepy.
It isn't very hard.
He gets a haircut once a month.
What kind of person would you like to marry?
There is something wrong with my car.
The only seat left was next to Tom.
The shooting started around noon.
I study many languages.
Do you have a match?
"At last, we arrived at the village."
Is this ours?
"It was hot, so we swam in the pool."
I really respect you.
He is not what he used to be.
Tom is wearing blue jeans.
Please wait a minute.
That's ridiculous.
Fish is sold by the pound here.
The company is struggling for survival.
He was proud of his brother.
Are you content with your present salary?
She may not come.
"Once you have formed a bad habit, you can't get rid of it easily."
"When I arrived, it was raining."
Is there anything else you want to ask?
It's not easy to believe.
What's your favorite sport?
That's the way it is sometimes.
This word isn't in common use.
Sit wherever you want.
Please give the baby a bath.
"For years, Tom suffered from migraine headaches."
There were many people in the hall.
I have one more question.
He's a late bloomer.
"I ate ice cream, too."
You can't be too good to your parents.
Where did he get that hat?
China is twenty times as large as Japan.
Is Tom reachable?
Bring the money.
It's going to rain.
Why did you do that?
Have you made sure the door is locked?
Why have you delayed seeing the dentist?
I shouldn't have eaten the whole bag of potato chips.
They rented an apartment.
I'm thirty years old.
I love a happy ending.
Tom and Mary said that they were very hungry.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
"Since our argument, Tom has kept his distance."
He stopped talking.
I forgot to bring an umbrella with me.
I can't afford to eat in such an expensive restaurant.
The final exams are approaching.
Why are they here?
A friend's coming over tomorrow.
I spent three hundred dollars today.
You should have told me that before.
You should stick those pictures in your album.
Are you able to come here tomorrow?
I'd like to go someplace that doesn't have many people.
What did you make?
He can play tennis very well.
I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
He's perfect at everything.
Is that Tom's lunch box?
Have you ever tried Japanese food?
My younger sister got married in her teens.
I know you want to go home.
I saw a boy with colorful shoes.
You should've consulted your lawyer.
Do you have any games on your phone?
I didn't do well on the test so my parents chewed me out.
You're just the same as you always were.
I'm relieved you're safe.
There's going to be a storm.
Tom ought to apologize.
I need more time.
Tom and I went swimming together.
He can come.
I wonder who has come.
I'm at Tom's house.
"Tom is still home, isn't he?"
I have few friends here.
Let's not talk about it any more.
Do you read me?
You shouldn't make any noise when you eat soup.
"The food wasn't good, but at least it was cheap."
I missed the plane.
"In the summer, eggs go bad quickly."
Make certain where the emergency exit is before you go to bed at a hotel.
Tom bought this horse at an auction.
He looked around the room.
We'll be leaving tomorrow morning.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
She accused me of telling a lie.
This is a very tall tree.
I could answer all the questions.
Please put these glasses away.
Tom has already stopped crying.
What do you want to do?
Wrap that up.
Don't mention the matter to him.
He rang the doorbell.
I was relaxed.
She looks sad.
I can't sleep.
Water is important for people.
She started talking with a stranger.
We ate curry last night.
My children are at school.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
Tom's French is impeccable.
We had snow this morning.
Tofu goes well with good sake.
Tom didn't believe a word of what Mary said.
The letter was wrongly addressed.
Don't call me anymore.
Did you enjoy the match?
This doesn't fit.
She's signed up for a couple of night classes at the local college.
"Tom is studying French now, isn't he?"
I waited for ten minutes.
"That's Tom's car, right?"
I'm sort of tired.
Are there any students in this class who walk to school?
Tom won the International Chopin Piano Competition.
I think this project is moving on the right track.
She has done her homework.
This ball is that boy's treasure.
"Now, what should we do?"
I think that Tom is a nice name.
Tom is stubborn.
You don't need to go unless you want to.
We watch TV every day.
She has given birth to five children.
It's too difficult for me.
I'm unlucky.
How are things at work?
I want to go to the bathroom.
The cash register was empty.
Could you please speak a little more slowly?
"Tom is still the same, isn't he?"
Maybe there's a secret door.
Tom is in bed with a temperature.
Is everybody hungry?
"Tom speaks French, too."
Tom isn't crying anymore.
May I ask you to call me back later?
Tom isn't as patient as Mary.
I can't live that kind of life.
I want to stay a few days.
I'm the captain.
English is not hard to learn.
We had a very vigorous debate.
"It's not only sports that I like, I also like music."
"Good morning. You're a bit late today, aren't you? ""Yes, I ran into a bit of trouble."""
Those books are mine.
She looked up at the ceiling.
Tom will be depressed.
"Do you like sports? ""Yes, I especially like baseball."""
You can't make bricks without straw.
Does this dress look OK on me?
"I hate Tom, to tell you the truth."
Are you mad at Tom?
I can't afford to waste a single yen.
"To tell the truth, I didn't notice it."
The boy was crying in the room.
"Tom is extroverted, isn't he?"
You sure gab a lot don't you? You're a natural born talker.
I think he won't come.
The traffic was heavy so I was late for the meeting.
A clever student can answer such a question easily.
Everything is fine.
There is a glass on the table.
Tom studied French for three hours last night.
It's not good to eat between meals.
I want to go to college.
Is there any help available?
My father is angry with me.
Don't interfere in other people's affairs.
Do you know what the difference between an emoticon and an emoji is?
Animals are our friends.
Tomorrow is October 20th.
"Check, please."
It seems durable enough.
She accused me of making a mistake.
I went there out of curiosity.
I study about three hours every day.
He read the poem with a loud voice.
I'll be thirty this October.
Today's low was 3 degrees Celsius.
You don't have to apologize.
The wind has calmed down.
It's none of your business.
I ran into Tom in the park.
I thought that the game was over.
I won't lie to you.
I've ordered you some dessert.
"Put your coat on, or you'll catch cold."
Tom isn't the same age as Mary.
That's a woman's job.
I feel like I've already seen this movie.
"Wow, this is a nice table!"
I got on the train.
The meeting ended at three in the afternoon.
I won't lose anything.
Did you have toast for breakfast yesterday morning?
"The meeting started exactly on time, for once."
The classroom was quiet.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Can I have this box carried upstairs?
Don't lick your fingers.
Tom was inebriated.
How long have you been ill?
He took over the business.
The story got more and more interesting.
I wonder if Tom could do that.
Tom loved Boston.
You don't have to eat it.
Tom owns a bar.
The fire burnt ten houses down.
I was on the point of leaving home when a light rain started to fall.
I hope to be a journalist.
My dream is to study abroad.
I feel terrible today.
Good luck with the new job.
Tom was sitting in the front of the bus.
Let's go to the kitchen. I’ll make us some coffee.
Tom put on a brave face.
I shouldn't have gotten up so early.
What do you think of the original plan?
He is listening to the radio.
A permanent costs extra.
I wonder what's wrong.
We always speak in French.
You will succeed some day.
I want to have a cup of coffee.
It's not always cold here.
It took a year and a half to paint that picture.
"Tom is your guitar teacher, isn't he?"
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
I don't know how to handle children.
We're not going back there.
The criminal is still at large.
Lots of people have tried.
I'm taller.
"It was a very, very hot night."
Has Tom retired?
I don't want to become a doctor.
I'll do that work by myself.
"If you hadn't been so brave, you'd probably have been killed."
How is that pronounced?
The accident created a traffic jam.
I played tennis after school was over.
Are you looking for Tom?
Tom paid.
You're not my wife.
I've never been to Europe.
She just kept her distance from him.
What's so interesting about baseball?
What's that horse's name?
Don't overdo it.
I'm sorry I called you a liar.
I don't feel like studying English today.
I suspect that Tom went to Boston last weekend with Mary.
I don't know how to hold chopsticks.
"I'm driving, so I can't answer the phone."
He gave it to me.
It no longer matters.
Does Tom play drums?
I have a prickling sensation in my left eye.
Tom wasn't able to find a babysitter on such short notice.
Tom turned bright red.
Are you lost?
"To make this cake, you'll need baking powder and unsalted butter."
Tom looks like he's been up all night.
Could you bring me a blanket?
There must've been a tacit understanding between them.
Would you like to go have a drink?
Will newspapers be able to survive?
This is the way to do it.
That couldn't be helped.
The soldier gave water to me.
I heard all about it from Tom.
All members need to observe these rules.
A heavy frost is expected tonight.
Let's get back together again.
The film was a great success.
She seemed surprised to hear her name called from behind.
Tom likes Mary very much.
Take this prescription to your pharmacy.
Tom has to take medicine every three hours.
I just finished doing that.
"Fortunately, the weather was good."
There was not a tree in sight.
It was an exciting game.
It's a fine day.
Tom is such a show off.
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Isn't that so?
He went fishing in the river.
He'll say yes.
I knew that Tom could do it.
If only I could sing well.
When was the last time you baked bread?
I don't remember what Tom said.
Let's put that on hold.
Changing outside is embarrassing.
Is it exactly 8:30?
That was a valuable experience.
What's the point of doing this?
Let me try it.
"I only ordered coffee, since I wasn't hungry."
Tom said that you were here.
I don't have any allergies.
Any day will do except Monday.
How many people were present at the meeting?
A burglar broke into the shop last night.
Where're you going?
I haven't actually shot anyone yet.
It is hard for an old man to change his way of thinking.
I gave it to the little boy.
"Before deciding, I'd like to consult with my family."
I want a pen pal.
Tom eats like a pig.
What's that restaurant's name?
You must adapt to a variety of conditions.
I'm not used to driving in the snow.
Does that price include tax?
I'm getting a little hungry.
Nobody tried to help Tom.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
All living things will eventually die.
You are always late.
"I'm sorry, I can't do that now."
No one knows what's going to happen.
The summer vacation has come to an end too soon.
I hope this makes it through baggage inspection.
Which side of the plate is the spoon supposed to be on?
Please tell me how to do it.
Thank you for calling.
Everything is in good order.
Is that Tom?
She must have been rich.
I really want a motorcycle.
She's just a wallflower.
I did that yesterday for the first time in a long time.
John is two years older than me.
He doesn't speak our language.
Work doesn't always begin at nine.
I don't believe in God.
Tom can't put up with Mary's bad manners any longer.
The shower is broken.
Will you pick out a tie for me?
There was a light rain yesterday.
Tom went down the river on a raft.
I believe in you.
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
I can't believe that Tom made a mistake like that.
Tom used to eat a lot of junk food.
Why don't you like the way you speak?
Has anything changed since then?
It was only a dream.
What kind of music do you listen to?
"If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask."
You may give this ticket to whoever wants it.
What do you want me to buy for you?
I'm afraid I cannot make myself understood in English.
"He's only twelve, but he plays chess with the best of them."
I'll be busy next week.
He has an ear for music.
Tom put the ice cream in the fridge.
It isn't a big deal. Don't worry about it.
Do you have any ones?
He is wearing glasses.
I thought I'd never be happy again.
When will you leave?
I'm pretty short.
It's just a little further.
"Apart from the weather, it was a good picnic."
That's not my concern.
He filled the bottle with water.
"I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now."
"If you don't hurry, you'll be late."
The river is wide.
Tom was very well behaved.
I really appreciate all the trouble you've gone to.
The girl singing over there is my sister.
Were Tom and Mary both in Boston last week?
I don't want to live by myself.
He likes coffee without sugar.
"This movie is for adults, not for children."
I saw him after ten years.
Be kind to those around you.
Tom chose to go to Boston instead of Chicago.
I can't go shopping today.
He can read English easily.
What're you looking for?
There's also another possibility.
I didn't believe it.
Slow but steady wins the race.
It's still crowded.
Tom was too angry to speak.
"If Tom doesn't do that, I'll be disappointed."
I'll do it starting tomorrow.
She's a big teaser.
Tom and Mary both relaxed.
Did you ask the others?
Tom found the letter Mary had hidden.
I heard the door open.
There are many words that I don't understand.
Let's go somewhere nice for our wedding anniversary.
You can stay if you want to.
Mary lost her cell phone.
Tom didn't know what happened.
Am I slipping?
Tom left his son a fortune.
Could I please have a glass of water?
Swimming is good exercise.
I want Tom to take a look at that.
I want to sing to his piano accompaniment.
I've become forgetful.
He is known to everyone.
How many languages can you speak?
I have three brothers and two sisters.
My pen is this one.
I ate lunch with Tom.
She left the hospital an hour ago.
I have a sharp pain here.
Don't deceive me.
You may stay here as long as you like.
This is the only book I have.
I can't wait for him any longer.
I'm looking forward to seeing you and your family.
Would you believe me if I told you that I loved you?
"In 1603, when King James I came into power, football was allowed again."
Do you care?
I baited the hook.
Mary barricaded herself in her room.
Put on your uniform.
We only have three days left.
I am looking for my brother.
The treaty bans atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.
My mother has good handwriting.
It's 50 yen.
I know that you did your best.
It's none of your business.
The train's departure will be delayed.
We're roughly the same age.
I lost the watch I'd bought the day before.
It's on me.
Have you ever cheated on an exam?
Could you please turn on the lights?
I want Italian dressing on my salad.
Which cat is yours?
I asked my son what he really wanted.
Did you telephone him?
I wouldn't contradict Tom if I were you.
The weather is good today.
I spoke French today for the first time in a long time.
I'm not busy tonight.
What places do you enjoy?
Are you good at remembering faces?
These oranges have gone bad.
I can't sell that to you.
The project was aborted.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
"As soon as Tom finished work, he went home."
May I touch this?
"When I got back, my bag had disappeared without a trace."
My husband is a very good cook.
I totally get it.
I like my last name.
It's hard to understand his ideas.
"Right now, I'm not hungry."
It's not cold.
Let's talk somewhere else.
It is dangerous for children to go out alone at night.
Tom was ironing his shirt.
I don't want to do that alone.
Only members of the club are entitled to use this room.
I thought that was really weird.
You can't get ahead if you don't work hard.
We used to play musical chairs in elementary school.
All of my friends are from Boston.
They're in aisle two.
We can't see any stars tonight.
There is an exception to every rule.
That work is almost done.
I'm being followed.
Take this medicine when you have a cold.
Tom is the only one in our office who can't speak French.
Are you wearing lipstick?
I usually eat breakfast here.
"When Tom was young, he ate three eggs every day."
It seems that you're not having a good time here.
You'd better not swim if you've just eaten.
"He found an old, broken chair and sat down at the piano."
Tom is a ski instructor.
Everyone had fun.
That's my money.
Are you telling me not to go?
I'll be 30 next year.
Has the evening paper arrived yet?
"Speaking of foreign languages, do you speak French?"
I knew I couldn't trust Tom.
It was a dark and stormy night.
She was very delighted with my gift.
I'm sure you understand that.
I want to eat some Korean food that isn't hot and spicy.
He should be back any minute.
You're the boss here.
"Unfortunately, that's true."
Money is the root of all evil.
There was complete silence. You could hear a pin drop.
What's that stain?
Love is blind.
It's a hot day.
I hit on a good idea.
I'm left-handed.
I can't lift my right arm.
I hate French.
I like going to watch baseball.
I can't see what you mean.
Are they still mad?
Let's eat the ice cream now. It's going to melt.
Tom shot and killed a bear.
I was out for a walk.
It was just a dream.
The policeman arrested the thief.
Do you have a snowmobile?
Gas prices are rising again.
You don't need to do that.
I'm fortunate compared to him.
The restaurant is always full.
Don't worry. I won't hurt her.
Can you validate this parking ticket?

"Tom met Mary at a party, and it was love at first sight."
What're you all looking at?
Stop comparing Tom with Mary.
Turn left at the corner.
He tried to stand up.
We had a heart-to-heart talk with each other.
This is by far the best house I've ever seen.
You can't miss it.
I want to stay outside.
I'm looking for my watch.
I'm so happy for you both.
I like oatmeal cookies.
The road is too narrow for cars.
It's hard to break bad habits.
Were you in Australia with Tom?
I never asked for this.
I spend all day in front of my computer.
Do you know why Tom doesn't like you?
What are you doing right now?
My dog barks at strangers.
Is Tom busy right now?
Is he back already?
We shouldn't let other people know what we did.
He's my brother.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Can you catch the chicken?
I closed my eyes for a moment.
Tom threatened to kill me.
Would you like milk and sugar?
I like going to places I haven't been to before.
This wasn't expensive.
I want to be here.
She returned the book to the library.
I wasn't yet asleep at that time.
Tom will go there with Mary.
Did you enjoy yourself at the party?
No one stops to listen to him.
The bus will come soon.
Tom and Mary took turns driving the car.
This table is heavy.
I've been waiting for you for over an hour.
It might rain.
Let's give it a try.
It's easier to teach children than adults.
Do you want to drink anything?
What do you want to study at college?
Do you also cook?
Have you kissed yet?
There is no fool like an old fool.
Tom and I used to work at the same place.
I can see a lady and two dogs in the car.
Are you normally this quiet?
He is very depressed.
Will you stop answering my questions with a question?
I have no idea how much it costs.
I should've bought a pencil.
She has a pretty face.
Do we really need it?
He was embarrassed.
I'll drop you a line when I get to Tokyo.
I didn't know for certain which train to take.
Were you at home all morning?
He threw a piece of meat to a dog.
"Thank you, Tom."
Theory and practice don't necessarily go together.
Is there a hotel around here?
I stayed up late last night.
I asked Tom where he wanted to go.
The line is busy now.
Tom knows nothing about Mary.
Philosophy is not a thing one can learn in six months.
"I used to wear ties, but I don't anymore."
Is this your cell phone?
I have a good sense of smell.
It'd be better not to talk about that here.
Let's get on the bus.
It is against my principles to borrow money.
She was on the point of leaving.
Tom took his son John to a baseball game.
"That waiter was a very nice person, so we didn't want to complain about the meal."
Summer is coming to an end.
Are you free?
Are you fond of music?
Thank you for your invitation.
Come a little closer.
A cat was sitting on the chair.
Could you please let me rest for a while?
I contacted my parents.
Don't be so stingy.
Tom saw something floating in the pool.
I can't believe it's been more than a year.
He started to study in earnest.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
Please show me those.
Don't forget to bolt the door.
The soles of my shoes are worn.
I'm going to drop by the supermarket.
We took showers.
I have a friend whose father is a famous actor.
She heard him cry.
Our club will hold its monthly meeting next Wednesday.
Signs of social unrest are mounting.
That cake looks good too. Give me a small piece.
Keep this information under your hat.
Read this right away.
He knows better than to marry her.
Mary is a bookworm.
I like wild flowers.
I'll take two or three days off.
"It's not what you say, but what you do that counts."
The cat caught a mouse.
He always wears dark glasses.
"What time will you arrive in Boston, Tom?"
It's upside down.
Your handwriting is similar to mine.
I'm still at work.
It's instinct.
None of your business.
She began to gain weight.
I don't know how to make sweet and sour pork.
I've been very busy the last few days.
The road was very rough.
What's your second foreign language?
I plan to see him on Monday.
I hear that you are a good tennis player.
I didn't expect it to cost so much.
Do you still have the receipt?
I have a question.
He's as good as his word.
"Observe your cat carefully. If you do so, you'll get to know your cat well."
Is French difficult?
I think it'll turn out fine.
What's your major?
I live here with my parents.
We ended up spending more than we expected.
May I have your name?
They speak Spanish in Mexico.
I spent hours reading books.
I think my German is really bad.
You'll gain nothing from doing that.
Did you bring it home?
How about that!
I don't often eat deep-fried food.
I feel really tired.
The apples are ripe.
She covered the mouthpiece of the phone with her hand.
My life would probably have been quite different if I'd been born a month later.
Tom bought a camera to give to Mary.
I couldn't make myself heard above the noise.
I'm not going to see you again.
I seem to have caught a bad cold.
I've heard a lot about you.
I didn't tell Tom that.
"Ask ten people, get ten answers."
She practiced the piano every day.
She has flowers in her hand.
Please phone me before you come.
Write your name and address.
You will survive.
I bought two bottles of milk.
I'd rather go out than stay indoors.
I aim to be a writer.
I plan to go to bed soon.
Tom had flu-like symptoms.
I understand French.
We have to memorize this poem by the next class.
Tom sometimes goes to Boston.
Where is the nearest police station?
Tom was very angry about that.
My TV has quit working.
The dog was chasing chickens around the yard.
She went to Germany to study medicine.
I don't have a bathing suit.
"Will you step this way, please?"
Can we do it again?
Tom enjoys everything he does.
You have to do it now.
I'm fearless.
I think it's OK.
"A glass of water, please."
Could you please tell me how to get there?
She seemed disappointed at the result.
Do you want me to help you with your homework?
Is that a bat?
Will you please show me the way?
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
She scrubbed the floor of the kitchen with a brush.
Tom didn't believe me.
Tom doesn't have any money.
He got off the train.
"4,219 is an extremely unlucky number."
I must renew my passport.
I saw him recently.
I once saw a man walk barefoot over hot coals.
Please don't hang up.
Could you lend me your pen for a moment?
I'll do it by all means.
When did you notice that your umbrella was gone?
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss your train."
Don't lose your temper.
You did great.
Tom isn't good at making quick decisions.
I wish I could find one just like it.
Some object to Tom's opinion.
Do you wear glasses?
Has he arrived yet?
I'm looking for a present for my mother.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Is this your mobile phone?
His speech held the attention of the audience.
Let's escape together.
It seems like the wind's getting stronger.
I want to live in Boston or in Chicago.
Why didn't you stop?
The rent will go up next month.
May I have your name?
I'm blessed with good health.
His opinions carry weight.
I went to bed after eating.
I'm afraid we can't make up for lost ground.
Would you please take my picture?
What do you mean?
My car is parked not far from here.
That's a great idea.
He spent all of his money on a car.
I used to take a walk every morning.
No one says it that way in real life.
"Where's my black coat? ""It's hanging up in the closet."""
My father often goes to America on business.
Tom isn't very good at tennis.
I have a mild pain here.
I'm in a very good mood today.
I don't remember how it happened.
I am waiting for the store to open.
This sort of work calls for great patience.
I work in a car company.
My father went to buy postcards.
They admire each other.
I'm baking a pie.
"The sperm whale can dive to a depth of 1,000 meters."
I'm a little irritated.
It was fun talking with you.
They all thought of her as a bright girl.
What's the weather like in Boston right now?
It's not that simple.
Tom says he might dye his goatee red and green for Christmas.
This room can hold three hundred people.
Mary was wearing a navy blue skirt.
Are you seriously thinking about giving Tom your computer?
I didn't notice when he left the room.
He weighs 10 kilograms more than I do.
It was a long letter.
You're telling me.
He does not have any friends.
How long have you known him?
There are lots of good restaurants near here.
I want to hear the whole story.
Put another log in the fireplace.
Your fate is in my hands.
How shall we deal with this problem?
We pray for peace.
I felt very happy.
Put on your shoes.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji three times.
I often go overseas.
That sweater looks good on you.
I'm a housewife.
Iridium is one of the rarest elements.
She grows many kinds of flowers.
Would you like some brandy?
Let's drop by his house.
We attribute his success more to hard work than to genius.
"In case of an emergency, push this button."
I study French at least an hour every day.
Tom wasn't suspended from school.
Is this new model available on the market?
I'm going to stay here until the day after tomorrow.
Where's the conference room?
I saw the game live.
"This hall holds 2,000 people."
Don't worry about it!
Tom lost his umbrella again.
"If life deals you lemons, make lemonade."
The box is almost empty.
How much of a discount can you give?
I may have put the key somewhere in this room.
Will you make a list of issues to discuss?
Tom said goodbye and then got on the subway.
Do it again!
"In the fall, many birds head for the south."
Would you mind shutting the door?
I have nothing to do with the case.
He seems to have no sense of humor.
How long does it take to get to the station?
There isn't any milk in the refrigerator.
I barely managed to catch the train.
There isn't much hope.
"I can play chess, but I can't play checkers."
A heavy tax was imposed on whiskey.
I regret to say I can't come.
"The day before yesterday, there was a storm, and yesterday it rained."
Thank you for the delicious dinner.
I can help if you like.
I have lots of friends living in Boston.
Are you hungry?
He will be back soon.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
"Tom still teaches French, right?"
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
The train was delayed because of snow.
Why haven't you had breakfast?
Tom was thinking about his children.
He sat in the chair.
What are you doing tonight?
Did you see anything else?
Could you share the table?
Christmas is almost here.
No one can live to be two hundred years old.
He fixed the net.
The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
I'll only be here for a few days.
Do you have a bike?
Don't pick that up. It's dirty.
Is French easy to learn?
Do you have a pen?
Come here at once.
I think it's time to wind up this meeting.
"If you see a suspicious person, please inform the police."
I thought that Tom was in his room.
We're going to get married in October.
I seem to have caught a cold.
Count the apples in the basket.
What's your wish?
"That's my CD, isn't it?"
The lecture started on schedule.
Would you like something to drink?
I helped carry those bags.
Are you already out of breath?
I'd like to live a quiet life in the country after retirement.
I have a terrible toothache.
I'm happy you're here.
I managed to make it just in time.
We have been assigned the large classroom.
I don't know either of them.
The policeman told me that the last bus leaves at ten.
Is Tom a good person?
"Seen from a distance, that rock looks like a human face."
I failed after all.
I invited Tom to the party.
We intend to leave tomorrow.
Tom has a really cute kitten.
"Unfortunately, the store was closed."
We all took for granted that the professor could speak English.

How have you been?
I spent three months in the hospital when I was thirteen.
Why are you still at school?
Who's your friend?
Are there many people in Europe who believe in ghosts even now?
I still have some things I need to do.
I really love her older sister a lot.
Tom drew this picture.
Please keep this a secret.
Tom bought a new guitar today.
You're a really sweet person.
How about playing tennis?
I would've never expected this to happen.
"According to the radio, it'll snow tomorrow."
Get out of the water. Your lips are blue.
I couldn't find a parking space.
Tom called me a cab.
He must have gotten over his cold.
I only eat kosher food.
Leave my car alone.
What do you have in your refrigerator?
Is Tom still hanging around the office?
We are all looking forward to seeing you and your family.
I want you to do it now.
Don't threaten me.
I prefer oranges to apples.
Tom is wearing a different hat than he was yesterday.
Tom began screaming.
He was badly wounded.
What time do you get up every morning?
The room is hot.
He lived in Matsue for seven years.
It was raining when we arrived.
I did not think he was so timid.
Tulips are in full bloom now.
Tom was asleep.
You don't have to do it today.
Life is enjoyable.
I've decided to go back to Boston.
He tried writing a short story.
Is the water hot enough to make tea?
Wait here. I'll be back soon.
Is Tom still out in the cold?
A child whose parents are dead is called an orphan.
I like the Terminator films because the special effects are fantastic.
Whose umbrella is this?
He tiptoed into the room.
He has been to London three times.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
"Was the food to your liking? ""Yes, it was very good."""
It wasn't difficult to understand.
There's nothing there anymore.
I'll buy it.
There's no evidence.
It isn't easy.
Sound quality matters.
Why did you two break up?
I told you never to move in a group.
I'm relieved you're safe.
Answer in French.
I have been to the airport to see my friend off.
She succeeded in crossing the Pacific Ocean by boat.

We have to appoint new members of the examining board.
Why are you up at this hour?
What are some of the difficulties you face in your work?

I have a hangover.
It's obviously a lie.
Are you saying that this is my fault?
Have a cup of milk. It'll do you good.
I fell down the steps.
Tom won again.
Did the girls finish eating?
Would you lend me your knife?
No one will believe us.
Don't go to that kind of a place at night.
Can you drive a car with manual transmission?

Come to my room between three and four.

These kinds of mistakes are easy to overlook.
My ears are ringing.
I read my horoscope today.

I got a sunburn.
It isn't a big deal.
"Tomorrow morning, wake me up at 6:00, please."
People ought to work.
I think that it's true.
What's your favorite song?

She is all right at the moment.

Please open the trunk.
Everything fell into my lap.
I feel bad about what I said.
I'll stay for a week.
Tom is impatient.
Come in.
You know how much Tom loves Chinese food.
She thought for a few minutes.
Pleased to meet you.
Tom and Mary have the same last name.
Tom looked very well.
Why didn't you call me earlier?
Which one do you want?
This plate is dirty.
"Could you tell me your name, please?"
Tom's mother tongue is French.
Tom did the same thing in 2013.
He found all his efforts of no avail.
Is Tom in the bathroom?
Please bring a protractor to tomorrow's math class.
We had enough money to buy what we needed.
The sun is up.
I seem to have misplaced my key last night.
Keep your hands off my stuff.

How would you like to pay?
Everybody was interested in the story.
My roommate's having a party.

I talked to her.
Let him in.
I couldn't control my anger.
Is there a hospital near here?
I want some help.
I watched three movies yesterday.
"You agree with Tom, right?"
She has long arms and legs.
She isn't here now.
Forget about that right now.
I'm not good at French.
She told me not to go there alone.
The dog was chained to the post.
Don't talk in the classroom.
Please do so by all means.
I can understand what you are saying.
The schoolyard was very small.
Is there something you want to tell me?
She was on the point of going out.
I'm sure you'll succeed.

Can I help you?

Tom is hard to please.
"Which do you like better, white rice or brown rice?"
Do you have a Christmas vacation in Japan?

He behaved badly.
Tom went to sleep.
I'm still undecided whether to go by car or by train.

How many kids do you want?
Why don't you say something?
I'll be a little late tonight for check-in.
That's great.
She has a son and two daughters.
He often calls her names.

I'd like to send this postcard to Australia.
He is unable to buy a car.

"I'm sorry, I'm doing something else now."

I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
It's too hard.
Were you tired last night?
"Good job, everybody."
I'm sorry that I'm unable to attend your party.
Who cares whose fault it is?
Get on a horse.
How about this color?
Why don't you be quiet?

There's some milk left.
We beat the man up.
Tom played hockey.
"It was snowing, but it wasn't very cold outside."
I'll look around the city today.
I'm sorry that I have troubled you so much.
I suppose he will be back soon.
I am not concerned with the matter.
A horse can run very fast.
"Look at the blackboard, everyone."
We were glad to hear that he got back safely.
Do you like science fiction movies?
He was sitting there with a pipe in his mouth.
I saw him running away.
Well done!
We must try to protect the environment.

How did you know my parents?
I narrowly escaped being run over by a car.
Tom needs to improve his skills.
How have you been?
Do I need to go right now?
I can't do it now.
Tom took the sheets off the bed and put them into the washing machine.
Tom tried.
Does Tom like tomatoes?
"Although I may be unhappy, I won't commit suicide."
I have no idea.
He missed the last train.
I almost got hit by a car.
Tom is always healthy.
"Will you have another cup of coffee? ""No, thank you."""
Do you have any snacks?
The first term starts in April.
That is a good idea.
Elephants don't eat meat.
Would you like some more beef?
I will telephone you later on.
"Show me your passport, please."
This river is going to overflow.
You should do that now.

I'm really lonely.
I had a good sleep.
I'm all out of tricks.
This is the last order.
What time is it right now?
He is familiar with the subject.
"How do you say ""I love you"" in French?"
The defendant was about to stand trial when he grabbed the deputy's gun and shot the judge.
He rose from his seat.
Tom was worried about Mary.
Please tell me where the meeting will be held.
The tower leaned slightly to the left.
Bigger isn't always better.
Put on your clothes.
Is this 223-1374?
I'm not sure what I should do.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You've already eaten the cake.
It took a long time to accustom myself to the noise.
Go slow.
I really feel like I missed my chance.
Do you belong to any clubs?
It's Tom.
Finding a replacement will be difficult.
This is life!
Tom's children are sick.
I haven't heard anything.
I've corrected the mistake.
The night is still young.
I apologized for what I did.
Both Tom and I are drunk.
I am thinking of going to Los Angeles.
Seven is believed to be a lucky number.
Mary was my first girlfriend.
People in the room didn't say anything.
Do you wear dentures?
We're going to set off at four.
She likes to read books.
I'll remember that.
All the cool kids are doing it.
"Once Tom starts talking, he's hard to stop."
My brother loves taking pictures of mountains.
Tom rang the doorbell a couple of times.
I don't want to go anywhere in particular.
Don't hang out with people like that.
"May I see your boarding pass, please?"
I think it was Tom's idea.
I thought you might want to look over these documents.
I couldn't get my idea across to the class.
I'm on my way out now.
Did you know about that person?
I went through the gate out onto the street.
He was playing the piano.
Tom was sound asleep.
Are Tom and Mary still working?
Don't touch this with your dirty hands.
What is the price of this watch?
Close the book.
The experiment succeeded.
I wish to see my father.
Tell me why you didn't go to school yesterday.
I'll begin doing the job right away.
I can hear something.
I'll drop you off at the station.
This river is not polluted.
We won the battle.
Tom is first in his class.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
Something's the matter with my watch.
Tom has gone to Boston on business.
Tom could do that today.
He abandoned his family.
Please leave everything to me.
Will ten thousand yen do?
Buy milk on your way home.
It is regrettable that I can't go with you.
Would you mind my opening the window?
I smell gasoline.
"When I first got to New York, I was in a daze."
Who's looking after your dogs?
Nobody is too old to learn.
What are you eyeing?
I had to wait for more than three hours.
This is a special occasion.
I want to tell Tom the truth.
It's very rude of you to say a thing like that.
"If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam."
It's as easy as can be.
They had a lovely time together.
Buy it.
How many kilograms of rice did you buy?
How tall you are!
I can't put up with that noise any longer.
She crouched down by the gate.
He went to the shop.
Did you get coffee?
I received your letter.
The ring was nowhere to be found.
You're my everything.
I plan to stay at home all day tomorrow.
This building changed hands several times.
We just had a bad day.
May I use your desk?
"You could at least say ""thank you."""
I'll call you up again in an hour.
Tom has made a lot of money.
Was Tom fired?
I should've brought an umbrella.
This milk tastes sour.
I can't swim well.
Tom opened the toolbox and took out a wrench.
I'm going to buy myself a motorcycle.
I prefer showering in the morning.
I'll ask the teacher about it after class.
Would you have asked me this question if I had been a man?
I don't think that it will rain tomorrow.
Where's Tom Jackson's office?
He accepted her gift.
Could you please speak a little more slowly?
I taught Tom three years ago.
He got me a watch.
There's almost no time left.
I was a student at that time.
He is the man you met the other day.
Here is our answer to your fax message dated April 1st.
The explosion was so powerful that the roof was blown off.
I gave Tom three options.
It was the calm before the storm.
Leave it as it is.
Why is Tom living in Australia?
The rain lasted four days.
He took a deep breath.
Tom died a few days ago.
I'm going to Boston next Monday.
"Well, I'm not going to lie."
Tom rolled up his sleeves.
You should've told me a long time ago.
I wish I could swim.
I wish you could have come with me.
That's today's paper.
I have been studying German for two years.
I'll keep your secret.
We can get a beautiful view of the sea from the hill.
I think Tom made a mistake.
I didn't know whether Tom was tired or not.
I'm accustomed to staying up late.
She kept on talking after I asked her to stop.
Tom is quite optimistic.
There were about twenty people there.
My hair is still wet.
Who stole the apples?
Please speak up.
Tom is only thirty minutes away.
Don't run so fast.
What is butter made of?
"Tom had plenty of chances to apologize, but he didn't."
I found it by chance.
I've just read this book.
It's time for me to take my medicine.
Were you the ones who closed the door?
I'll do everything I can.
Are your tires OK?
Could you let me see your notes?
"What does ""resident alien"" mean?"
Tom isn't as patient as Mary is.
You decide.
Tom is washing the dishes.
It was not until he was forty that he began to study German.
Tom hates the rules.
Our son is sick.
"In case of a fire, use the stairs."
How long do you think it will take to go to the airport?
Get the dog out of here.
She loves antiques.
Tom teased Mary.
I always walk to school.
"I like summer, but not winter."
This is my bag.
I watch TV after supper.
Tom has a 13-year-old sister.
I have a lot of things to do this morning.
Tom would've done the same thing.
Have you finished doing your homework yet?
Have you ever milked a cow?
I have just come back from school.
Tom isn't trustworthy.
I speak French with Tom and Mary.
He has been busy since this morning.
He is well off.
Excuse me for being late.
Let's not quibble over trivial matters.
There was a car accident yesterday.
He is uncertain about his future.
I think you should think about the future.
"It's your money, isn't it?"
Tom took a very deep breath.
I feel safer here.
"It's cold outside, but it's warm in the house."
I ran into my old teacher at the station.
I rang the bell several times.
Don't play catch in the room.
Don't depend too much on others.
He is in great trouble.
Men don't wear vests much these days.
Tom didn't want Mary to drive his car.
He has a bath every morning.
Guess who won.
I have an appointment with him for five-thirty.
"If you could go back and start your life again, from what age would you like to start?"
Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work.
"Fortunately, it isn't raining."
Tom was abused by his father.
The question is whether Tom will read the letter or not.
Dad isn't home.
I wonder how I can become rich?
Some people think that eating grapefruit with every meal will help you lose weight.
She always urges him to try new things.
They all have come.
Maybe I can fix it.
The room is in immaculate order.
Come to my house.
Tom has quit smoking.
That's a very pretty name.
You should keep your promises.
I'll send the book to you by mail.
I can't go until he comes.
I need some hangers.
We have two dogs. One is black and the other is white.
What're you going to do this weekend?
I'm looking forward to it.
Japan is hot and humid in the summer.
Are you sleeping in here?
She's very interested in music.
Don't tell Tom about it.
My neighbor always mows his lawn on Sunday mornings.
You're really a hard worker.
Tom doesn't look that tired.
They showed me a lot of beautiful photos.
Did you turn the light off in the living room?
It seems like it might rain this afternoon.
I should exercise more.
Can you handle it?
Come tomorrow morning.
I'll think about it.
Tom just texted me.
I was hoping to meet you there.
Tom and Mary are smiling.
Behave yourselves.
Are you going to go to the party tonight?
"If you don't want to do it, that's fine."
I'm not mad anymore.
I feel very sick. I think I'm going to throw up.
My wallet was stolen while I was asleep.
What time is the last train?
Can you please delete this photo?
You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
We're just friends. Nothing more.
I just got here.
It began to rain before I got home.
The novel ends with the heroine's death.
This must be a real diamond.
I drink about three liters of water every day.
Do you have any photos of Tom's wife?
I wish our classroom were air-conditioned.
I wanted a brother.
I couldn't help laughing at his haircut.
It seems that I'm not lucky today.
We carried our children on our backs.
I'm really sorry.
We spent our holiday in Boston.
I'm still a high school student.
She is off duty tonight.
So what are you implying?
Where is the ticket window?
You're too thin. You ought to eat more.
Can you drive a car?
Quit wasting my time.
Why are you talking like that?
I stayed at a small hotel near the lake.
Please leave the windows open.
"It may, indeed, be a mistake."
I'm losing weight.
Tom fell off the ladder.
We don't carry leather goods.
I'm going to give up.
I might be late for dinner.
Get moving.
Tom understands a little French.
Tom sat on the table.
I'd like to confirm the departure time.
You're totally right.
We did everything we could.
This house isn't so big.
I was having lunch.
I can't live any longer without him.
The top of Mt. Fuji is covered with snow.
I would rather be deceived than to deceive.
I can't stand raw fish.
Even I was defeated.
Tom was wearing a trenchcoat.
It's very windy and my hair got messed up.
There's a book on the table.
Tom's parents died when Tom was three.
He hit me on the head.
Our class consists of fifty boys.
"It may, indeed, be a mistake."
I prefer blouses made from cotton.
Tom is one person I never want to talk to again.
"If you are not firm with the children, they will get out of hand."
The game wasn't exciting at all.
He is very kind.
Never in my life have I heard such a thing.
That's very unlikely.
I'm about to have lunch.
Don't give up!
Would you like ice?
I give in.
The girl closely resembles my dead mother.
I don't think Tom will be here on time.
You were right after all.
What subjects do you like the best?
I want to visit Australia someday.
We'll climb the mountain if it's fine tomorrow.
I planned on doing that alone.
I can't get enough sleep anymore.
I didn't expect Tom to be at the meeting.
No student was able to answer the question.
Why would you like to work here?
How many eggs are in the refrigerator?
We got together in the park.
Someone help me.
"As a matter of fact, I don't know anything about Tom."
We must provide for our old age.
We really thank you for your patronage.
This sentence is in the present tense.
It's not hard.
Where should we meet?
Let's call it a day.
"If you do it at all, do it well."
Do I have to do it over again?
Tom closed his laptop and stood up.
I don't want to drink any more apple juice.
My grandfather's picture is on the wall.
"Dinner finished, they enjoyed playing cards."
I'm glad to be with you.
"Which do you speak more often, French or English?"
He works for a bank.
Have you finished eating your lunch?
I know Tom isn't as tall as Mary.
Hold still.
I found it difficult to make myself understood.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
Can I have your phone number?
I'll have to go and see what I can do.
"You know that I'm still planning to join the team, don't you?"
The firm has added 25 new associates to work on mergers and other deals.
This is the very thing that you need.
I saw him cross the road.
Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
Did you find a job?
Whose book is this?
Take this medicine every four hours.
I felt faint with hunger.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
The ingenious boy won a prize for his invention.
There's a water shortage in this area.
Is it possible that you're wrong?
Tom likes Swiss cheese.
Our parents took care of us and now it's our turn to take care of them.
I've never thought about becoming a teacher.
The idea that air has weight was surprising to the child.
It doesn't matter.
That law was abolished in 2013.
I went to see a movie yesterday.
"If you get sleepy, tell me."
Is this Tom's car?
I forgot to put film in the camera.
I have just been to the post office.
Are you really going on a date with Tom?
We all thought so.
All of the cake is gone.
A man who never makes mistakes is a man who does nothing.
Do you know who lives here?
"At that time, I was still a student."
The driver ignored the stoplight.
What's the matter?
I'm a morning person.
"Every month, I write letters to my friends overseas."
Please hold on a moment.
What an interesting book this is!
"A few minutes later, the police came."
I am afraid of dogs.
Let's play hopscotch.
I don't think he'll come.
"Excuse me, do you have the time?"
Many economists are ignorant of that fact.
I'm not stupid.
How can we put it into practice?
I wrote Mary a letter.
The stolen car was found in the parking lot.
He wiped his hands on a handkerchief.
We can't trust him because he often tells lies.
I have a sore throat and a slight fever.
It looks like it'll clear up.
Don't interrupt when others are talking.
Mary hasn't left yet.
I've just finished lunch.
I thought I'd wait for you here.
I remember seeing him somewhere before.
Children often hate spinach.
"Get back, get back!"
I have to get a little sleep.
They quarreled.
Don't say such a thing.
Her daughter can recite many poems.
"If you don't leave now, you'll miss your train."
Which direction did Tom go?
Cut the cheese into thin slices or into little cubes.
We went up step by step.
She was angry. That is why she remained silent.
Do you know each other?

Let's stop here for today.
My dentist recommended that I chew sugar-free gum.
Whose turn is it next?
There are fish.
Tom is good at copy-and-pasting.
I love stories with happy endings.
Tom drove.

We were nearly frozen to death.
I belong to the music club.
Do you live by yourself?
She burned her left hand.
He is a lazy student.
The burglar was traced by one of the things he had left on the scene.
I don't want to live with you anymore.
Tom is extremely clean.
I'm used to getting up early.
Listen closely.
What time does the train leave?
Tom might've cried.
Let's go Dutch.
We will start when he comes.
Someone left the water running.
It's a good idea.
Did I say something stupid?
"The bill, please."
Here comes the bus.
Please open the package.
It's open every day of the year.
The police came quickly.
The sugar is in the sugar bowl.
He's not my boyfriend. He's my brother.
Your feet are big.
Tom didn't want Mary to come here.
All babies are cute.
Let Tom relax.
Tom said that he wanted to go shopping.
Tom can't taste the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine.
Could you send up some aspirin?
Have my eyes also started to fail?
I'm the youngest.
Tom gave Mary a vague answer.
Didn't you know Tom also speaks French?
I hope to build a new house next year.
I was able to catch the last train because I walked very quickly.
Not every day is Sunday.
Don't spill the beans.
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
There seem to be several reasons for that.
Don't let anybody know I'm here.
The exhibition will be held next month.
I'm accustomed to staying up late.
I've no idea what's happening.
I think Tom worries too much.
Tom said he'd never water skied before.
Mary felt that she was getting old.
You should stop.
It's no big deal.
We examined the following magazines to collect the data.
I advised him to come back at once.
Tom told me he was really busy.
"How old are you? ""I'm thirty."""
Do you have the time?
I've lost my wallet.
I want to eat something.
The coal in the stove is burning.
"I slept until noon, and then studied for the rest of the day."
No one else will make you a better offer.
We were very tired from the five-hour trip.
We kept them quiet.
She is very particular about her food.
Tom's face is red.
Let me see that list.
I'm very hungry.
Do you understand what he's saying?
Tom told me that he sells about 300 cars a year.
I think that things will work out.
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
"Out of twenty students, only one had read the book."
Watch your fingers!
Tastes differ.
Tom is probably waiting.
Is she your mother?
He was too busy to notice it.
Close your eyes again.
"He tried to make his wife happy, but in vain."
I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find out who hacked into our system.
That's all for today.
We'd better take up this issue immediately.
"I have 1,500 head of cattle."
The noise outside his window prevented him from sleeping.
This is the book that I bought yesterday.
We usually eat cooked fish.
We were caught in a rain shower.
"It being Sunday, the shop was closed."
I must get breakfast ready.
His story sounds strange.
Tom forgot to put on underpants today.
I feel uneasy about my future.
Tom studies French every morning.
"You're impressed, aren't you?"
What's the purpose of your visit?
I bought a loaf of bread for breakfast.
I can't stop thinking about Tom.
I've never seen this species of fish before.
The date of manufacture is shown on the lid.
Today is my parents' wedding anniversary.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I don't know the reason.
He sprained his ankle.
Tom is sure that he'll pass the exam.
Some boys came into the classroom.
"Do I have to bring my son to your office, Doctor?"
"Call a taxi in the morning, please."
Will you do me a favor?
"Do you have anything to do? ""No, not really."""
I'll be watching you.
I'm tired of your complaints.
He was hard to please.
It's time to get up.
"Don't do anything stupid, OK?"
I enjoyed the food a lot.
Tom ran like a scared rabbit.
Are you drunk?
He smoked as if nothing had happened.
He lent me two books.
We must devise some means of escape.

The train is 10 minutes late today.

Don't get the wrong idea.
Please clear the table.
He was educated by her grandfather.
What are you doing now?
I knew Tom could do it.
Congratulations!
Tom has a secret.
"When I met her the other day, she asked about my parents."
I think you should keep that picture.
Tom dropped out of high school.
Both my mother and my father are teachers.
Learning French is easy.
I don't like eggs.
He didn't get her joke.
Tell that to Tom.
I wrote to my teacher in French.
I had my T-shirt washed.
"I don't hate Tom, but I don't like him either."
Give me a break.
I asked what he was going to do.
Tom has a family to provide for.
Take it easy.
How much is the annual membership fee?
I don't think you'll need an umbrella today.
Tom has already finished his lunch.
I just love flowers.
I hope to see you again.
I want to sing the song.

It's already dark.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
This is a problem you have to solve by yourself.
How have you been?

Tom is also coming to the party.
I reached school before the rain started.
Let's leave that matter for later.

I'd like to put my belongings away.
I'm going to call you every day.

Thank you for the help.
Would you mind opening the window?
A fool and his money are soon parted.
She couldn't accept that her husband died.
Is it anything serious?
I've been craving frozen yogurt.
Are you sure you don't need anything else?
I'm not pretty.
She looked out of the window.
I can't speak French as well as Tom can.
I bought sandals.
I don't smoke or drink. I just do pills.

He demanded that his salary be increased.
It's rained for three days on end.

I got a season's pass to all the home games.
Are you still friends with them?
Tom came in spite of the bad weather.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
I've caught a cold and my head hurts.
Tom enjoyed Mary's story.
I'd never do what Tom did.
He's three years older than she is.
I'm very tired.
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
How long have you been working here?
Please take a seat and wait.
"If you want to eat at Raffle's, you must reserve weeks ahead."
Did I say you could use my phone?

My children were taken away from me.
We're getting fewer and fewer students.
Mary hasn't bought her ticket yet.
Tom was raised in a small village.
The enemy is caught like a mouse in a trap.
Do you think in French?

It is high time you were in bed.
I'm only here for a couple of days.
One mouse is running around in the room.
Are you avoiding me?
That flag is very beautiful.
I passed all my exams.
"Today's a bit warmer than usual, isn't it?"
I come from Australia.
My scalp is very itchy.
I hope Tom likes the present that I bought for him.
How often does this happen?
I don't have anything to do this afternoon.
We love them both.
This river is dangerous to swim in.
"Excuse me, but may I use your telephone?"
I don't have a smartphone.
Few people know about the plan.
The clock has stopped. It needs a new battery.
May I call later?
I wonder why Tom is so mad.
Birds sing.
I'm worried about your health.
Leaves begin to fall in October.
Come see me again.
Come on in and make yourself at home.

I have to leave.
We're in a rush.
I'll meet you at the station tomorrow.
I got your letter.
My leg hurts.
I will give it a try.
How long has it been since you've had a girlfriend?
Tom can't even write his own name.
He couldn't bring himself to shoot the deer.
He's a kind person.
I really hate it.
I don't know if it's true.
Is Tom richer than Mary?
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs lately.
Are you still driving that car your grandfather gave you?
I hear a dog barking.
I'm glad that I'm not paying.
"Tom has a lot of money, but not very many friends."
You have no right to oppose our plan.
I suspect that what Tom said was a lie.
I like playing chess.
I have finished my homework.
Anywhere with a bed will do.
He forced his way into the room.
I often see him.
One of the answers is correct.
She was ashamed of her children's behavior.

The city hall is just around the corner.
He tried opening the door.
My grandmother can ride a motorcycle.
"Do you know where the potato chips I left here are? ""No."""
Please come to see me tomorrow.
Don't eat while reading.
At least the work is done.
They pitched their tent on the beach.
You can't see Mt. Fuji from here.
I knew Tom could do that.
Even a cheap frying pan will last a long time if you treat it well.
I ate smoked salmon.
That house is very small.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
I'm an honest person.
I already told my parents.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Wouldn't it be good to ask Tom?
It's 7:50 in the morning.
Nobody in their right mind would do that.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
He's such a cold fish.
Dahlias are beautiful flowers.
Come here and sit down.
You should've called me.
Do you like French wines?

How many floors does that building have?
He is regarded as the best doctor in the village.
They sell sugar at the store.
That's a good idea!
Tom looked at the price tag once again.
I like it like that.
We have to wait for him.
It was a very nice day.
Don't forget to pick me up at the station.
Here we go.
"Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the station?"
The water reached my knees.
Which direction did Tom go?
I advise you to be punctual.
He returned home for the first time in ten years.
Why haven't you had breakfast?
He has no sense of humor.
Tom finds fault with everything I do.
Tom doesn't know what's really going on.
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Deaf people can converse in sign language.
He is a teacher.
Are you getting nervous?
Is Tom behaving himself?
This lid is so tight I can't open it.
Tom arrived at midnight.
There are many oranges on that tree.
Put on your skates.
I completely disagree with this.
"All of a sudden, the clerk lost his temper."
He is so heartless.

What sound does a giraffe make?
He will come back soon.
He found an unexpected way to deal with the problem.
I hope it doesn't rain today.
We have a party tomorrow evening.
Tom forgot to say thank you.
I must help her.
The rice is still warm.
What do I have?
Is this Tom's motorcycle?
What did you pay for those shoes?
"I don't smoke now, but I used to."
Was it cold?
I want to be like Picasso.
Tom doesn't seem hungry.
You should drive at a safe speed.
Tom tickled Mary.
It's not good to overeat.
Tom wouldn't lend his bicycle to me.
I must go now.
A heavy snowstorm kept us from going out.
The engine is running.
Mary is Tom's biological mother.
I am in charge of the third-year class.
We had to pay an additional ten thousand yen.
The product carries a high price tag.
He got up early this morning.
I like traveling alone.
Are you satisfied with the result?
You're wanted on the telephone.
It goes without saying.
She gave me a present.
Make this sentence a little shorter.
He has two daughters.
There was a big earthquake last night.
Most shops near the school are closed on Saturdays now.
"In Japan, the new school year begins in April."
I don't mind lending you the money provided you pay it back within a month.
I can't use a fork well.
I will go out after I finish my homework.
Let me think about it a little longer.
I don't know what motivated me to come here.
Tom was born twenty minutes before his twin brother.
Tom was very angry about that.
Tom bought a Japanese-Chinese dictionary.
I think Tom is out on the porch.
Come when you have some time.
What did you have to eat?
Please tell me how to do this.
I hardly ever go to museums.
We have run out of gas.
There are still people who believe that the earth is flat.
This isn't enough.
I'm quite comfortable in this room.
None of us have succeeded.
I've lost my mobile phone.
He is powerful.
Tom and Mary are brother and sister.
It's quite an interesting project.
How beautiful she is!
Did Tom respond?
I hope you understood.
It's cold. Why are all the windows open?
I got a Christmas card from Tom.
She was the first girl I'd ever kissed.
What would you like to do now?
I speak French.
I intend to go to bed soon.
My phone's always on silent.
I think a lot of people resort to binge eating due to stress.
Tom received the same present as Mary.
Why don't you stay for a while?
This is a very tasty apple.
Is it OK if I take pictures?
Who's the manager of that baseball team?
The police officers arrested the burglar.
Mail this letter tomorrow morning.
Could you help me write a letter in French?
They found that their families didn't like each other.
Are you going to give Tom anything for Christmas?
He is alone.
"By the way, what time will you go there?"
"Unfortunately, it's true."
This work doesn't pay.
It'll take me a long time to finish reading that book.
Tom dictated a letter to his secretary.
It's much too dark to play tennis.
I was just in time for class.
Tom's father suddenly became sick.
What is the total number of students?
Is Tom's story true?
He said he could swim well.
I'm not angry.
I can hardly see without my glasses.
He has good eyesight.
You'll be hearing from us soon.
Please take these dishes away.
Tom pretended to be deaf.
Those kinds of methods are out of date.
I'm looking for my pencil.
"It may sound strange, but it is true."
She plays tennis very well.
Leave it.
Are you still scared?
That isn't funny.
Smoking isn't permitted here.
It happened in a flash.
Tom isn't here.
Please listen to what Tom has to say.
"On hearing of the victory, the whole nation shouted for joy."
The seats are all sold out.
Would you please say that again?
"Tom and Mary are both thirty, but they look much younger."
"Wherever you go, I will follow you."
I remember seeing her before.
Why are you learning a foreign language?
Did they live here?
I didn't know that Tom used to work in Boston.
I want to see that movie.
I caught up with him soon.
Lincoln is one of the greatest figures in American history.
Every word in this dictionary is important.
Free advice isn't always good advice.
Did you call Tom?
Is that person OK?
Short skirts are already out of fashion.
It's supposed to get colder and snow later today.
Don't look down on others because they are poor.
I saw Tom sleeping on a bench in the park.
I have a tennis match tomorrow.
I never dreamed that I'd meet you here.
You are drunk!
I can assure you that honesty pays in the long run.
Tom's face suddenly turned red.
My blood pressure is low.
She is afraid of cats.
What're your plans for the weekend?
I'm not accustomed to speaking in public.
Tom was killed by a stray bullet.
I'm on holiday this week.
Look at the picture on the wall.
"Copy this, please."
"Je t'aime means ""I love you"" in French."
Is there an ATM close by?
The food has arrived.
Quite a few people came to the party.
I've had this dog since he was a puppy.
There was blood everywhere.
"When I reached the summit, I was thoroughly worn out."
Let's put it off till next week.
"On Mondays, we usually go bowling."
I've made a couple of friends here.
"If I were you, I'd ignore it."
I thought that I told you to trim your beard.
Tom can't count yet.
Do we have to tell Tom?
I'd rather die than give up.
"You guys love each other, right?"
Why have you changed your mind?
He died of that disease.
This isn't very clear.
Tom didn't know that Mary had decided to quit her job.
Stop hanging out with losers.
She is obstinate.
To the right of that office is the Tokyo Building.
I have breakfast every morning.
What is that?
When does it start?
Why is he here?
I told you I hated that shirt.
Is it free?
Do you have a menu in English?
Who do you think will come first?
I'm worried that Tom will get hurt.
Where did he get that hat?
I was able to get him to understand.
Is this the stuff that Tom wants?
I don't remember the title of that movie.
Could you please tell me your name again?
Why is everybody laughing?
She is anxious about her safety.
Go along this street and you'll come to the post office on the left.
The train was about to leave the station.
I'll never fail you.
Is this the original or a copy?
Is that a boy or a girl?
I've left something in my car.
It's good to be back home.
He has already gone out.
I'm here waiting for you.
"How many pumpkins do you want? ""Three, please."""
You don't have to take your umbrella with you.
Don't call me anymore.
I'm depressed today.
"This time, I think you're right."
"Tom, we've arrived!"
I'll be waiting for you at the station tomorrow morning.
Do you want something to drink?
Don't open your umbrella in the lobby.
Was it an interesting speech?
Tom likes fishing.
What kind of boat do you want to buy?
Tom helped me write this essay.
Do you need a hand?
Do you think that it'll rain?
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.
"I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode."
He told her about his plan.
She is a clerk in the supermarket.
I felt a sudden pain in my side.
He opened the cages.
One of us will have to go.
"Tatoeba means ""for example"" in Japanese."
I don't want to buy this one.
Bring some money.
He has the water running in the bathtub.
The sea was calm.
It seems that there will be a storm soon.
I began living by myself.
Would 8:30 be convenient for you?
A lot happened in a short time.
I've learned a lot from Tom.
How are you getting along?
"If no one ever took any risks, we'd never learn anything."
I can't believe Tom did that to Mary.
What are you doing?
It would be nice if Tom didn't keep making unnecessary remarks.
I still have the sweater that you gave me when I was 13.
I burned the paper.
He pretended to be a doctor.
Where are your uncles?
I'm at Tom's house.
I'm feeling a little blue today.
"My mother hated caterpillars, not to mention snakes."
He had bruises all over his body after the fight.
I have lots of things I need to do today.
He has just become a principal.
I'm sure you'll like it.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Follow him.
We need a tool to open it with.
You should take care of your sick mother.
Tom dumped Mary's body into the hole he had dug previously.
Let's go by car.
I was just in time for the flight.
"On the following day, we all had terrible hangovers."
Tom has a lot of books.
My grandfather died five years ago.
I can't answer the phone now.
You should go to bed.
Wait one moment.
My left arm is asleep.
Why are you so surprised?
You lied to Tom.
"When I was a child, I used to swim in that pond."
Fantastic!
Mary is respected by everyone.
He was hit by a car and died right away.
I'm living in the city.
How much is 300 euros in U.S. dollars?
His parents acted to calm him down.
The sun descended behind the mountains.
There's no point in hiring a babysitter for the evening.
I'm near the on ramp to 25 north.
Who designed that museum?
I have a few pens.
That book is familiar to all young children.
You seem to be thinking of something else.
I hope it'll clear up soon.
I'm dead tired.
A burglar broke into my apartment yesterday.
I'm the black sheep of the family.
I may have left my umbrella on the bus.
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
The car kept swerving from lane to lane.
Where's the dressing room?
The news caused a great sensation.
I like to walk in the mountains.
Is Tom still a bartender?
Tom and Mary seldom eat out.
Please help me.
"It's been raining heavily since this morning, so I don't want to go anywhere."
Do you know the girl standing by the window?
How much is the fare on the bus?
You seem really happy.
Is it true that you wanted to live in Boston?
The names are in alphabetical order.
Our refrigerator isn't working.
How are you doing?
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
There is a cookie under the table.
Thank you for the other day.
That's a real bummer.
Have you ever been attacked by a dog?
Don't try to pass the buck.
My parents don't like my girlfriend. They think that she's not good enough for me.
Are you absolutely sure?
"Can you weigh this, please?"
A man came to visit you last night.
He is good at gymnastics.
Tom had a rough day at work.
He is sure to win.
I was born in 1972.
Will your report be finished in time for the meeting?
"It's a secret, so please don't tell anybody."
"Is there anything you want to say, Tom?"
I think Tom was in Boston.
My brother sometimes helps me with my homework.
Words are interesting.
It's two in the afternoon.
I copied the link.
I talked on the telephone.
I saw him coming out of the hotel.
Tom fell off his horse.
The accounts have been audited.
You two are really kind.
That team has nothing but strong players.
We got there at the same time.
We have little snow here.
Will this medicine really do me any good?
"I haven't read ""War and Peace"" either."
I love video games.
It's hard to believe Tom is still single.
Tom is in love with Mary.
At what time will you be leaving?
I acted for our captain while he was in the hospital.
I need to shovel snow off of the roof.
I'm tied up now.
She wears heavy makeup.
What did you do in Boston?
I couldn't say anything.
Would it be OK if I turned the lights off?
Can you decode it?
The bee flew out the window.
Are all the doors closed?
It doesn't matter now.
I will stay here till three o'clock.
You always have an excuse.
Will you turn on the television?
You'd better stop smoking.
This play has three acts.
The audience was deeply affected.
I don't believe in religion.
My shoulders are stiff.
We cannot predict what will happen.
A winter without snow isn't winter.
The revolution ushered in a new era.
He shook his son by the shoulder.
Tom went over to Mary's house for Thanksgiving dinner.
"If we don't hurry, we'll be late."
Don't move from here.
I often think of my dead mother.
You'll find our house at the end of the next street.
Tom was my hero.
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
I had to part with my competent secretary.
Have you ever been overseas?
"We waited at the library half an hour for Tom, but he didn't come."
He is lacking in common sense.
I've got a cold sore on my lip.
Could you turn the volume down?

Are you close to your family?
I'd like to see you if possible.
Tom was good at playing the violin.
"Whichever you choose, you will be satisfied."
The pain in my back is getting worse.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.

Which of these three books do you recommend?
"Excuse me, I'm coming through."
Hurry up or you'll miss the train.

I spent all morning reading books.
Allow me to help you.
French isn't easy to master.
I don't like studying.
Two men wearing ski masks entered the bank.
The monkey fell from the tree.
I'll rely on my father for half of my tuition.
"Speak French, please."
"To tell you the truth, I don't love him."
"Tom, are you okay?"
It's high time you got married and settled down.
"Have you ever been to New York? ""Yes, I've been there a couple of times."""

I felt the house shake.
That's not altogether false.
Mary is not my type.
Tom isn't afraid.
"The train arrived on time, so we didn't have to wait at all."

You must not smoke in this building.
I'd like to be able to read books faster.
I just can't stand this hot weather anymore.
The calf was born this morning.
"Because my mother was ill, I could not go there."
Staring at people is rude.
"Is that true, though?"
Tom left his door open.
I can't wait any more.
That's asking too much.
What time will you be home this evening?
Did you enjoy the party?

I feel very sad tonight.
Be yourself.
I'm looking for Tom now.
What kind of person is she?
I usually get home at about 7:00.
He's racking his brains about how to deal with the matter.
It's hard for me to put my thoughts into words.
I can't sleep because of the noise.
I'd rather die than do that.
His argument was far from rational.
I'll go change.
Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
They stopped talking as soon as I came into the room.
I don't like waiting.
Whose book is this on the table?
One minute has sixty seconds.
There's no mistake.
I've decided to give Tom my old bicycle.
How long have you been here?
Mary lost her phone.
How did he react to the bad news?
Tom will make a good doctor.
Please explain how you did it.

Tom has already fallen asleep.
What would you like to do?
I was dumbfounded.
"Hi, my name is Tom. What's your name?"
That'll do.
I was in Australia just last week.
It got very cold last night.
I bought a red sweater at that shop.
"You came by train, didn't you?"
Do you have a bike?
She left her bag behind on the rack when she got off the train.
He is taking a day off today.
I heard somebody knocking.
"That's what Tom suggested, and I think it's worth a try."
I have a sore throat from a cold.
What's the sense of working so hard?
It's very dangerous.

Was it snowing yesterday?

The supply cannot keep up with the demand.
Give me time.
He always sings in the shower.
Please make yourself comfortable.
No one can turn the clock back.

"In the park, some sat on benches, and others strolled about."
Tom only has eyes for Mary.
I sat waiting on a bench.
Don't get a stomachache by eating too much.
"In other areas of the city, fighting continued."
I ordered what I wanted to eat.
Please take me to the hospital.
Does Tom live around here?
"In general, little girls are fond of dolls."
Shakespeare is one of the greatest poets.
"If I have time, I'll come."
Tom got off the elevator.
Stay awake.
I can't stand it.
She was arrested by the police.
What was that girl doing in your room?
Tom's my friend.
Let's leave it up to him.
The taxi abruptly turned left.
That box is bigger than this one.
Do come if you can.
I saw this movie a very long time ago.
I'm going to take a bath.
I want to see my father.
Math is my least favorite subject.
Knead the dough.
Children like climbing trees.
I'll go make lunch.
The book I bought yesterday is pretty interesting.
When will it start?
Can you loan me a pen?
Your name sounds familiar to me.
Can I stay in the car?
Are you tall?
He was late for the 7:30 bus.
There are no drugs here.
He was very happy.
Such a proposal would only be turned down immediately.
All the passengers were saved from drowning.
"Ah, I understand."
Is that why you've been acting so weird lately?
Tom has no idea what I'm going to do.
I won't say yes.
Tom and Mary don't seem too busy.
I really love half-price sales.
She acted as if she didn't care what happened.
Wait a moment.
That's not my concern.
How do you like this town?
I need sleep.
Take any train on track 5.
Is that snake alive?
Will you wash the dishes?
I was just lucky.
Those two are exactly alike.
"My grammar may not be perfect, but people seem to understand what I'm trying to say."
She was kind enough to help us.
The reason I don't do it is because I don't feel like doing it.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
I haven't yet visited Boston.
Tom looked like he was sad.
The foreigner spoke Japanese as if it were her mother tongue.
Tom knew that it was a bad idea.
Tom would never hurt Mary.
He wants to work at the hospital.
I'll take a shower.
I never thought this would happen.
That'll do.
I found my father's diary that he kept for 30 years.
There's a crack in the window.
What's in your pocket?
Do you all have pencils?
The newspaper said that contact with the plane had been lost.
I had a very good time.
These blouses are long sleeved.
Tom eats nothing but vegetables.
I'm not in a position to give you any advice.
"Mary has nobody to talk with, but she doesn't feel lonely."
Health is better than wealth.
I'd bet my life on it.
There is little water left.
Tom started screaming.
We were obliged to abandon our plan.
The work must be done by Tom.
"Since then, diplomatic relations between Canada and Iran have been suspended."
The squirrel is climbing the tree.
No one knew why.
Human beings can't live without food.
"Even though this chair was cheap, it's very comfortable."
I wish to climb Mt. Fuji again.
I wish that I could come up with a good answer to the question.
Would you like a drink?
Tom can't put up with Mary's behavior anymore.
I wish you had come with us.
Tom came home with tears in his eyes.
I wonder if that person is OK.
I won't be at home tomorrow.
Wash your hands with soap.
Tom has brains.
I'll be meeting Tom in Boston early next week.
Tom disappeared in 2003.
She's my older sister.
Let's watch TV.
The storm prevented us from going out.
Who would care?
I like beef most of all.
Come home at once.
She saw a tall man yesterday.
I don't know what I'll do next.
Are you through with the work?
I thought that I was going to die.
Tom is daydreaming.
Winter is my favorite season.
My father gave me a lot of money.
We need to reduce the demand for energy.
"I'm really good at math, but I'm terrible at English."
I don't believe such things exist.
I don't want to think about it.
I took a lot of pictures on my trip.
Nobody would say that.
I don't know much about you.
Tom put down his racket.
My mother is making a birthday cake for me.
Do you love my brother more than me?
How long will you be staying here?
I'll be back at six-thirty.
It isn't until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
"Like father, like son."
He is younger than me by three years.
Is your house near here?
The price of oil went down.
I got a hole in my jeans.
Don't put things here.
She left home ten minutes ago.
It was you that suggested seeing that movie.
I'm fair.
How do you want your eggs?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
The game will be called off if it rains tomorrow.
I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
I need to rest.
He's tremendously handsome.
Did I do anything stupid?
Tom was a real hero.
Refer to the Users' Guide if you have any problems.
My brother doesn't go in for sports.
It's Mt. Rushmore.
Everybody in the village looks up to him.
"Everyone does it, even the teachers."
I was swamped with work.
I need to declutter my house.
Their modest income doesn't allow for many luxuries.
I didn't take it. You can check my pockets.
He really turns me off.
He thought it over and decided not to go.
He didn't know what to say.
That's pointless.
There's a place I'd like to show you.
I didn't ask him.
Do you like horror movies?
Do you know why she's so angry?
Who will take care of the baby?
May I leave this with you?
Did you bring some warm clothes?
Please drive carefully.
I was with her for an hour.
Tom knows quite a lot about Mary.
There are two beds in my room.
I can neither speak nor read French.
Choose between the two.
Where did you find that doll?
I'm sick of eating codfish cakes.
Tom and Mary did their homework together.
What has brought you here?
What do you think of this sweater?
Oh no!
I'm a bit short of money now.
They were afraid of being overheard.
I'm accustomed to getting up early.
I agree with your opinion about taxes.
Tom was irritated.
Tom doesn't understand the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs.
The cat likes to sleep beside me.
Would you lend me some money?
"I waited for Tom and Mary, but they didn't show up."
"From the look on your face, I can tell that you have good news."
I don't think we'll be using this room again.
If only I had listened to your advice.
Don't worry. I've done this many times.
They asked for my help.
Who are you going meet tomorrow?
Tom didn't agree to do it.
May I drink alcohol?
I want to go to America some day.
It's no use asking me for money.
The boy remained silent.
"Where have you been? ""I've been to the barber's."""
"During the summer vacation, I made friends with many villagers."
Tom isn't taking a nap.
I invited them to dinner.
There's a white dove on the roof.
Where do you keep your medicine?
Where are all the others?
Doesn't Tom ever wear a suit?
I bought a new pair of shoes at the department store the day before yesterday.
Tom and Mary are often together.
I'll be seeing you.
Is Tom very mad at me?
We could see the sunset from the window.
Where are they living?
He seems kind.
Everybody is hungry.
Will you warm up the soup?
My dream has come true.
Well done! Your parents must be proud of you.
Is this enough?
Lightning is usually followed by thunder.
There were at least a hundred people present.
You've grown up.
My mother washes clothes every day.
Mary helped Tom.
Maybe it can be fixed.
There's always a next time.
Does Tom play tennis?
"Excuse me, I'm coming through."
She can't even speak her native language without making mistakes.
"Two beers, please."
Could you please try calling this number again?
I'll go to the hospital today.
Have a good time.
He took a book from the bookshelf.
What are you looking for?
"Since my mother was sick, I couldn't leave the house last Saturday."
I can't see in because the curtains are closed.
Her argument was not based on facts.
I want to go.
Tom wrote Mary's phone number in his little black book.
Cool down.
What kind of costumes did you buy for the children?
"Hurry, and you will catch the train."
I go to school by bus.
He acts very shy in her presence.
How about dropping in at the shop?
I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
I like to ride on trains.
Please say hello to your wife for me.
"My French isn't very good, unfortunately."
Of course.
The bus was crowded.
Fill in your name and address here.
I decided to be a doctor.
Tom needs to talk to us.
That massage felt good.
Do come and visit us.
I can't find my gloves.
English is difficult to learn.
Was that information needed?
How does he go to school?
Doors open at 2:30.
I don't wear a tie.
I don't want to think about anything anymore.
That's none of our business.
"Where did you go? ""I went to the train station to see a friend off."""
Tom is intoxicated.
Keep talking.
The rent is very high.
We had to wait for over three hours.
I got the tickets for free.
We'll go when the rain stops.
The parents couldn't make out what their daughter wanted.
I got to know Tom when I was a college student.
What's the matter? You look very angry.
Who hit the most home runs?
She greeted him waving her hand.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
I will never be your friend.
Tom couldn't help but laugh.
Answering that question was hard.
The weather forecast said there'd be rain all week.
Which plate should I serve sashimi on?
"I'm sorry, but I don't feel like going out today."
I hate it when women say that all men are the same.
My father is well as usual.
Get out.
This isn't my translation. I would translate it differently.
My mother is knitting me a new sweater.
What did you get on the test?
He is famous as a doctor.
This place is an accident waiting to happen.
Nobody's taking a bath right now.
Where can I buy a CD?
I came to Australia three years ago.
I don't know which room the criminal entered.
I thought that you were at work.
I'm only here for a few days.
Tom is Mary's imaginary friend.
I studied it thoroughly.
She was holding an umbrella.
"This is cheap, isn't it?"
Why did you say such a thing?
Your husband is a lucky man.
I hope they don't resort to violence to accomplish their goals.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Thank you very much for flying with us today.
There are many books in this library.
Please help yourself to the cake.
Who is that old woman?
Does everyone have a pencil?
He is interested in anything that has to do with religion.
I know that Tom would love to see you.
I'll be ready in a jiffy.
I'm enjoying myself.
What were you planning to do?
Come here at precisely six o'clock.
Learning foreign languages is boring.
See you again tomorrow.
The bullet got the policeman in the leg.
"Some people traveled by train, and others by road."
I left my address book in my room.
I've got nothing to give you.
We're closed today.
We carried our children on our backs.
Smoking is not allowed in this room.
"Do you have a driver's license? ""No, but I have a learner's permit."""
I like to wear my skirts knee length.
I like sitting by the window.
Thanks for your concern.
I appreciate it.
Everybody has flaws.
His house is somewhere around here.
I noticed that immediately.
I didn't murder anyone.
This newspaper is yesterday's.
He is still young.
"That's not our pet rabbit, unless I'm mistaken."
"Yes, I have a good idea."
How did that occur?
Call me if you need my assistance.
I take a bath every other day.
He is something of a celebrity.
I never felt this way before I met you.
I must go back.
There's a beautiful bridge over the pond.
Do you want to go out for a drink?
The trees are beginning to bud.
Do you know whether Tom can speak French?
I heard that Tom likes Mary.
Could you stay here for a while?
When did you finish writing the letter?
Do you drink alcohol every day?
Tom will be here at 2:30.
I may go out if the rain lets up.
What do you figure she is doing now?
This sofa is too small.
I agreed with her.
Tom didn't pass today's exam.
I'd like to thank you for helping me translate the report into French.
A home is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase so you don't want to make any snap decisions.
Trust me.
Registration starts at 2:30.
I can't stop crying.
Are you sure there's nothing else to eat?
How have you been recently?
Let's just listen.
Is it windy enough to go sailing?
Tom never apologized.
Every country has its own history.
I know this is hard.
I'd like to ask a question.
I feel relieved.
The debate is continuing.
Tell Tom to lock the door.
This offer is available for five days.
Your student called me.
Are you drunk yet?
"I like you a lot, but I don't want to marry you."
I had my blood pressure taken.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Can we stay here until it stops raining?
I wish that I hadn't gotten married.
I want to be like you.
Are you working today?
"Years ago, when Tom's children were young, he used to take a lot of pictures."
"Unfortunately, few passengers survived the catastrophe."
It's my custom to go for a walk before breakfast.
Leave it up to me.
I've never been to Paris.
What would you like to eat?
She was understandably angry.
It was raining yesterday.
May I trouble you for the sugar?
What were you doing at that moment?
Tom was listening to his iPod as he worked out.
Tom tossed the keys to Mary.
He hit me on the head.
Do your best and don't worry.
Do you have your student ID card?
How does it fit you?
"When I take a deep breath, a pain runs down the right side of my back."
How did your weekend go?
Could you get me some tea?
I've just eaten some sushi and drunk a beer.
I failed to go to his birthday party.
I hate singing in public.
You've already eaten the cake.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
Why don't we take a break?
I don't like that idea much.
"Why are you here, Tom?"
My body aches all over.
She is very intelligent.
Tom says he's going to turn himself in to the police.
I'm opposed to that bill.
Come quick!
Do you have something to do with this group?
Is that a new jacket?
A little bird told me.
Tom and Mary often talk to each other using Skype.
The package arrived sooner than I expected.
Tom and I are both drunk.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
We had to react quickly.
Thanks for helping me write my resume.
"In Canada, there are many areas where it is illegal to log trees."
We want our children to be happy.
Translate this into French.
Are you in the sauna?
I feel like I can do anything.
Tom comes here every three days.
It happens all the time.
Shopping isn't what I want to do today.
Please give me a cup of tea.
The rice is delicious.
He spoke well of her son.
I was greatly impressed by the speech.
I got up very late this morning.
Today I'm working from home.
"If possible, I'd like to see Tom."
I was just leaving home then.
"Whose shoes are these? ""They're Tom's."""
Don't worry about such a thing.
I promise I'll stop now.
I think I'll buy this tie.
I spent Christmas with my family.
Where's your first aid kit?
Are you asking me on a date?
I often talk in my sleep.
The mail is delayed because of the strike.
I'm going to read this book tomorrow.
Crime does not pay.
I don't like it either.
Are you saying that Tom was right?
I leave the matter to your judgement.
Please show me something a little cheaper.
I'll wait here till he comes back.
"Some like red wine, others like white wine."
Tom hasn't had much education.
He often quotes Shakespeare.
I think that I forgot to turn off the lights.
He loves going to the theater.
"You go to school, don't you?"
Tom doesn't know when Mary got back from Boston.
I thought that you'd probably already gone home.
I'm on a diet.
You talk as if you knew everything.
I've been on the go all this week.
I saw Tom talking to Mary.
Goodbye.
"Tom is rich, but he isn't happy."
This is my notebook.
She was surprised to find many beautiful things in the box.
That's a bright idea.
Tom lost his balance and fell down.
Tom's sisters are both married.
I'm sure he mistook me for my sister.
I like to watch the sunset.
Where was it that you found this key?
It's time to take a bath.
I guess I'll stay a while.
Tom changed jobs.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
We were nearly frozen to death.
I believed every word he said.
Clean up your room.
The problem was so difficult that I couldn't solve it.
"If you hurry, there's a chance that you can catch the bus."
We will do anything for you.
You're welcome.
He came home late last night.
I know almost nothing about it.
You cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs.
I will not be busy tomorrow.
He's afraid of the sea.
Don't let anyone know I'm here.
It's great to see you got home safely. How was Australia?
I was bitten in the leg by that dog.
When did you notice that?
I thought you were good at French.
That's a famous mountain.
You have lung cancer.
It's quiet here at night.
Which team are you a fan of?
Tom forgot to buy milk.
I bought a six-pack of beer on my way home from work.
Please accept our apologies for not filling your order sooner.
I arrived here yesterday.
"Leave me alone, please."
Do you know anybody in Boston?
The water pipes froze and then burst.
Have you ever eaten a loquat?
Count from one to a hundred.
It was easy to fix.
"Tom is married now, isn't he?"
"A glass of white wine, please."
How many days will it take until the swelling goes down?
Bring the laundry in.
I wish you'd told me the truth then.
"If it's raining tomorrow, I won't go to the beach."
Let's take a walk for a change.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
How do I turn this computer on?
How far is it?
Tom is obviously not here.
I've phoned Tom.
I ran into an old friend.
"Yes, we can go."
Isn't that how competition works?
"In 1951, Sister Teresa was sent to Calcutta, then the largest city in India."
"I warned you not to do so, didn't I?"
People love to fight.
I couldn't sleep at all.
Tom can read French.
German men go to the hairdresser more often than German women.
It was cloudy yesterday.
The young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen.
"I am happy, she said to herself."
The shop was closed when I went there.
We're about the same age.
A meter is a hundred centimeters.
What do you know about Tom's girlfriend?
"I went, too."
I had a bad dream last night.
"It'll be fine tomorrow, too."
The rain is beating against the windows.
That isn't how we do things here.
I went to Vienna for the first time last year.
We finally got rid of our old car.
What's done is done.
It'll be ready soon.
I know where you live.
"In Canada, you're not allowed to drink until you are 20."
What should I eat?
Does Tom really have to go?
It's rumored that secret peace talks have already begun.
Books were lying about in the room.
She made me a nice dress.
I think that I'll be back in about 30 minutes.
A middle-aged woman with a knapsack on her back seemed to be looking for a place to sit down.
Whose turn is it next?
I'm the one who knocked on the door.
He's not the same as he was before.
He turned up 30 minutes late.
He has her under his thumb.
Where am I?
I was laughed out of court.
I had barely gotten home when the storm broke out.
I was born in this house.
Tom is reading the newspaper.
He's just an ordinary man.
What did you have for breakfast today?
You don't have to trouble yourselves.
"This is an apple, too."
Drive carefully.
Thank you all for your cooperation.
It would be best if you stopped smoking.
Tom is in front of me.
See you again tomorrow.
Tom has rented a car.
I wasn't able to go to his birthday party.
Wow! It's been a long time.
I love trains.
I visit my grandmother twice a week.
My name's Tom.
He always prefers his pie served a la mode.
The song reminds me of my home.
I can't help doing that.
They are the same age.
Did I understand you correctly?
I'm not so good at tennis.
There you go again.
"If you don't behave, Santa won't come."
Tom is on good terms with Mary.
May I borrow these books?
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was there.
"Speak up, Tom."
I came here to study French.
What is important in writing a composition is to make your ideas clear.
It's too small.
He often comes late.
That was no ordinary storm.
"Looking up, I saw him come in."
What's the longest river in the world?
Tom and Mary started talking as soon as they both entered the room.
Should I go with you?
I have been to the airport to see him off.
I also put my pens in the drawer.
The rain lasted through the night.
We've bought our tickets already.
Tom did neither of the two things I asked him to do.
Tom has a sweet tooth.
What illness do I have?
What's your primary reason for studying French?
I can't imagine anything more wonderful.
I'm glad I'm here.
I will have obtained a driver's license by the end of the year.
When are your final exams?
I pushed Tom back into his room.
"Oh, really?"
I went to the movies with my brother.
The man robbed her of her bag.
I ate a hasty lunch.
I've already written a letter.
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
I wish you spoke French.
"Don't press your luck, kid."
Check your spam folder.
I don't know why I did that.
Tom doesn't know how to enjoy life.
That train doesn't stop here.
He speaks Chinese fluently.
Is there a mall near here?
Why don't we go and see a movie?
Tom majored in sociolinguistics.
Are you ready?
You look bored.
I don't want to run into Tom.
"May I use your telephone? ""By all means."""
I had a strange dream last night.
We can meet with you whenever it's convenient for you.
He could no longer stand the pain.
Tom is crazy.
I think I've lost my wallet.
This novel consists of three parts.
I'm free all afternoon on February 27th.
"Stand up and introduce yourself, please."
I haven't smoked for ages.
"Whenever Tom calls, we chat for a long time."
I want to travel to Australia.
I've been told that I sound like a kid when I speak French.
Tom is three years older than Mary.
Read between the lines.
"Put it there, not here."
Let me rephrase it.
I have many model cars.
I'm running behind schedule.
Why do you think animals dread fire?
Is there someone here that speaks French?
No one came here.
I had no one to talk with.
Food is essential to life.
Move the chair nearer to the desk.
Don't take life so seriously.
Please put a lot of cream in my coffee.
Take the oranges out of the fridge.
The policeman took the thief by the arm.
See you around.
Don't cheat.
She arranged the flowers beautifully.
I want to do a little physical exercise.
Are Tom and Mary in the same class?
What time did you arrive there?
You are too young to travel alone.
Do you get enough sleep?
Tom wore a camouflage jacket.
He had to work as hard as he could to finish it in time.
"Finally, Tom achieved his goal."
My little sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
She's old enough to take care of herself.
Do you know the rules of the game?
I'm searching for my brother.
I'm sure that guy must get picked on at school.
I am a member of the sales department.
The weather's not good today.
We're not out of the woods yet.
I can't see in because the curtains are closed.
I have no idea what that guy is thinking.
Would you look after the place while I'm out?
This happens all the time.
What did you want to say?
I came here so that I could go kayaking.
Tom isn't a mean person.
She ate her dinner.
I wish Tom would stop smoking.
It was a true story.
It was an adventure going down the river on a raft.
He seldom goes to church.
Let's talk soon.
Which train are you catching?
"She's in high school, but her boyfriend is in college."
This is the village where I was born.
I have a lot to do today.
This is the place where the battle took place.
I've got no friends.
It's started to snow.
The discussion was heated.
What kind of stain is that?
We advanced to the finals.
This stuff happens all the time.
If only I could drive a car.
I'll be at home in the morning.
My father makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
How many miles is it to the next gas station?
The tourists wandered around the stores.
She answered my letter right away.
I only came to say I'm sorry.
I burnt my fingertip.
I'm nearly ready.
It's difficult to keep secrets.
My bike was stolen.
"Around here, everyone skis."
Where do we get the textbooks?
I would choose the exact same thing.
He took over the business from his father.
Her daughter is bad at cooking.
He is willing to stand by you.
"Every time I read this book, I find something new."
"I'll be back in a minute, he added."
I need to get groceries.
The little boy embraced his dog.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Do I have to answer all of the questions?
Keep going.
"That brown one is mine, too."
I have to do it by myself.
Don't overdo it.
Why is Tom still at school?
I'm better than Tom.
I finally found the solution to the problem.
Why would he tell such an obvious lie?
There's only a day left.
I've changed my mind.
"They left at 5 o'clock, so they ought to be home by 6."
Tell me how you solved the problem.
My sister got engaged.
Tom got angry with the high school students.
The water cooler is out of order.
Do you drink coffee?
You can come visit whenever you want to.
Have you known her since 1990?
This box is too small.
I want to go there again.
It's almost time for breakfast.
What time did the concert begin?
I opened the link.
"So, did you like it?"
You won't get away with it.
We went there last month.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
Tom and I went to the same high school.
Tom has gone missing.
I can't afford to buy a house.
They walked side by side.
We're just like brothers.
It was very nice seeing you again.
She took part in our project.
It's theoretically possible.
Please give me the newspaper when you've finished reading it.
Here is my bicycle.
Tom writes very quickly.
That isn't mine.
This is my favorite food.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother.
"Will you go? ""I will if I have to."""
I think it'll rain soon.
He sat at the edge of the stream.
Don't underestimate your opponent.
I wouldn't want anyone to read my diary.
Is all of this money yours?
My children won't eat fish.
There were plenty of guests in the hall.
Bad news travels fast.
He slid the money into my pocket.
He was bewildered.
It's very hot at night.
Are there smokers in your family?
I will come earlier next time.
Let's play volleyball.
Please be quiet.
I'll be late for school!
Are you sure you're not tired?
"You don't eat much, do you?"
I will wait for my sister here.
Don't pick on younger kids.
That girl loved climbing trees.
I'm not going to study tonight.
Who do you think will come first?
I'm in the first year of high school.
Tom doesn't ever want to see Mary again.
Tom was very polite.
I've just come back from Australia.
Is Tom really sleeping?
"In order to buy a foreign car, he worked very hard."
We can't win.
Don't forget to mail this letter.
Can you lend me your eraser?
My family will be away for a week.
Don't make me wait.
She became happy.
I'm very tired from work.
Tom didn't speak French when I first met him.
She advised him not to go.
Tom was totally drunk.
Are you traveling alone?
My aunt speaks Chinese as well as English.
Maybe I'm working too much.
You're speaking a little too fast for me. Would you speak a little more slowly?
Wasn't it supposed to snow last night?
Tom asked somebody else to do it.
Money does not always bring happiness.
There's a cat sitting on the chair.
You're so adorable.
Towns are larger than villages.
They say she's good at cooking.
My father was a doctor.
Why were you waiting for me?
I'm not chicken.
I don't want to go on my own.
I thought you were from Australia.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary have both left.
"Tom is thirteen, but he still believes in Santa."
Why aren't you wearing shoes?
Are you going to Australia on business?
I should've bought a ticket for that concert.
I felt it my duty to do so.
My hair is a mess.
I can understand this problem to some extent.
Do you think it'll rain tomorrow?
I thank you with all my heart.
I really love my work.
You all right?
I was impolite.
I don't think that this is a very good idea.
Her only pleasure is listening to music.
You must study hard.
Some people think of reading as a waste of time.
Can you see anything?
I saw at a glance that he was an ordinary man.
My birthday is October twentieth.
My business is slow right now.
I forgot to give you my phone number.
Apples are fruit.
Tom is on his way here.
Start singing.
He is seriously ill and unlikely to recover.
"Sorry, I am late."
This is a restricted area.
It rained for several days on end.
Tom is visiting his uncle in Boston.
Which credit cards can I use?
It's the truth.
She has her reasons for doing that.
I don't mind if you smoke.
When can we eat?
I'll send Tom there to check out the situation.
I don't know which room the criminal went into.
Sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
Don't forget to turn the light off.
I want a job.
Tom dropped his new smartphone.
A police officer asked me for my name.
I'm going to Tom's house tomorrow.
"If it were me, I'd say, ""OK."""
That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.
This building changed hands several times.
He was watching television all day.
You have many books.
What's the number?
The rebels have captured the broadcasting station.
Please write down what he says.
I'm a nurse.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
Would you mind waiting another ten minutes?
One of my earrings is missing.
What's your occupation?
Tom put the ring on Mary's finger.
The light is changing from red to green.
I can trace my ancestors back 200 years.
"Mary is a famous actress, isn't she?"
He walks to school.
Tom and Mary live in a house by the river.
May I use this telephone?
It was a dark night.
Children need love.
You mean you really can't swim?
I thought that Tom was wrong.
I was starting to get annoyed.
I went to the police station.
He's a biologist.
Tom hit his head on the roof of the car.
It depends on the context.
He devoted himself to music in those days.
I don't feel like talking to anyone.
Nobody had to wait.
Did you know Tom was married?
How far is it from here to the station?
You will not be able to catch the train.
You're wearing your shirt inside out.
I will go.
She adapted her teaching method to slow learners.
Who hit the home run?
Please give your mother my regards.
I'm scared of lightning.
What should I do? I said to myself.
"Nowadays, traveling costs a lot of money."
The bus is very crowded this morning.
It's about time you sent the children to bed.
What's the most delicious fruit in Japan?
Is that your boss by the window?
I met an old friend on the train.
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
Do you really think Tom likes Mary?
This house isn't very large.
It's a lovely day today.
I hate cats.
I'll be there shortly.
Is this your helmet?
Revolutions that don't succeed are soon forgotten.
The king was deprived of his power.
It's a fifteen-minute walk.
Take good care of yourself.
"If you want to ask a question, please raise your hand."
"Tom used to always wear a watch, but now he just looks at his smart phone."
What fruit do you like the best?
I get sleepy after eating a big meal.
"I remember it, too."
"If we leave soon, we'll make it in time."
I prefer to work on my own.
Tom said that I looked very pale.
Don't get your hopes up.
Tom walked in the room.
Tom has helped me many times.
It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.
He came to see me three days before he left for Africa.
I picked a daisy for her.
We'll leave in an hour.
Mary is a good seamstress.
You will be laughed at.
I don't want to play.
Tom has never been absent from school.
He didn't even say goodbye.
Newton saw an apple fall off a tree.
Get the dogs out of here.
He has accumulated wealth.
Tom sat down beside Mary.
Do you have an underwater camera?
I want to stay for several days.
Tom and I each ate a couple of bananas.
This beach is dangerous at night.
There were holes here and there.
"Are the drinks free? ""Only for the ladies."""
I have a date tonight.
Tom has gloves on.
I never expected it to end like this.
Could I see the timetable?
Are you really going to go to Boston next summer?
I was expecting it!
He can't run very fast.
Tell Tom how you feel.
He has been teaching for 20 years.
Do whatever you can.
"It's hot in the summer, so I don't want to wear a suit."
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long.
Tom is still sleeping.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
I believe that Tom is innocent.
Business is slow.
Is everything OK with Tom?
I suppose he will be late.
Please don't touch those books.
Where's the nearest drugstore?
I may have caught a cold.
No one has ever said such things to me.
He gave us quite a lot of trouble.
What are you going to have?
Don't let go of the rope until I tell you to.
Take your time.
This room is not very large.
It is never too late to learn.
We ate sandwiches for breakfast.
I feel very cold.
Tom was sitting beside Mary.
She liked talking about herself.
I'm against the war.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted to do.
You must keep your room tidy.
"I had intended to finish this yesterday, but I couldn't."
Mary rested her head on Tom's shoulder.
This was my fault.
Did you wash these apples?
Are you coming to the party tonight?
Watch out for cars.
I went to the doctor today.
"Whenever I talk to my father, I realize that he has a lot more experience than I do."
Don't look down on poor people.
Tom is about three.
"I would cry, too, if that happened to me."
That tie doesn't go well with that jacket.
Is it far?
My father bought me the book.
Mount Everest is also known as Qomolangma.
"Unfortunately, it's true."
We should be able to complete the work in five days.
He put his room in order.
I can't see anything but water.
She was injured in the traffic accident.
We began our work at noon.
He cannot have done such a thing.
Some people say French is easy to learn.
I am weak in math.
He couldn't stand being away from his girlfriend.
"It's not what you say, but what you do that counts."
I'll get over it one way or another.
I remember this place.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
They're all innocent children.
Your daughter isn't a child anymore.
I'll have to work overtime every day next week.
I'll leave Boston on Monday.
He is a tall and strongly built man.
He's the type who doesn't worry about details.
I study about two hours every day.
Do you want to be an astronaut?
You seem busy.
It got dark.
We arrived at the museum after a ten-minute walk.
"Hey, wait a minute."
Maybe Tom is in the backyard.
Did you grow up here?
This is an important letter.
I know him by name.
"If he is innocent, it follows that his wife is guilty."
That apple is big.
A gentle wind is blowing.
Divide the cake between you two.
Does money bring you happiness?
"To make a long story short, he married his first love."
Mary is the prettiest girl in her class.
All my friends came to my birthday party.
I wanna quit my job.
How did you guys meet?
Please wake me up at seven.
I forgot to bring my glasses.
Drive safely.
I was extremely busy.
This is the train for Boston.
I'm not as tall as he is.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
I must admit that it was my fault.
Mary is Tom's stepsister.
Numerous stars were visible in the sky.
I'm looking for someone who can speak French.
Why did you lie about how old you were?
Tom is photogenic.
I paid about 50 dollars.
I studied before supper.
I would like to try this dress on.
Would you like to hear the story about Paul Bunyan?
What's your mother tongue?
The bridge is being repaired.
I woke up at five this morning.
Tom is the strongest.
She hugged him.
I wonder if it's true.
Tom asked Mary what her last name was.
We've decided not to get divorced.
This isn't for sale.
Many thousands on both sides had been wounded.
The moon is already out.
Be careful. It's hot.
She studied abroad in order to brush up her English.
"Tom is extroverted, but Mary isn't."
May I look at your passport?
A parrot can imitate human speech.
It has become noticeably colder.
We happened to be on the same train.
This is probably a real diamond.
Why do you think that happened?
I'm afraid that I might make you angry.
I wanted to pay.
Could you bring me some water?
You are home late.
What do you usually eat for dinner?
There's nothing in the basket.
You should do your best in everything.
My skirt is too long.
That makes me very happy.
There were two hundred people in the room.
Boston is worth seeing.
Let me know by telephone.
This dictionary is completely useless.
You'd better wait until the police come.
Why did you lend money to someone like her?
I'd prefer to not talk about that now.
It was a scary movie. I think I'll have nightmares about it tonight.
Let's cut the cake now.
Why didn't you finish what you started?
Tom and Mary both study French.
Are you seriously thinking about buying a computer from that store?
When do the stores open?
I know that Tom is smart.
Few passengers got injured in the accident.
"Well, if dinner isn't ready by seven, I'm going to a restaurant."
Tom fell asleep quickly.
He always sings in the shower.
He's been staying at that hotel since five days ago.
The answer might surprise you.
I can't bear this noise anymore.
The roof was damaged by the storm.
It's six degrees below zero.
Would you like some fruit juice?
"At first, I thought it was the name of a place in Hokkaido."
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog.
The boy was used to being scolded.
He is not here.
He will come soon.
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
You can't smoke during work hours.
The patient may pass away at any moment.
It's a very dangerous job.
We have no sugar.
Thank you for everything you've done.
I believe in you.
I've been looking for it all morning.
I think you should get more rest.
Should I wait for her to come back?
My life has changed for the better.
Are you unlucky?
What a surprise! I didn't expect to see you here.
I bought it on credit.
They're digging a hole.
You can go if you want to.
The address on this parcel is wrong.
The new movie was a big hit.
The project's taking shape.
Are you bringing your camera?
You should eat more vegetables.
She went shopping.
It doesn't matter all that much what college you graduated from.
Don't worry about Tom.
I've got a terrible toothache.
Tom showed up at about 2:30.
I went for a walk with my son.
Tom can't come to the phone.
I never wanted to hurt you.
It's almost ten o'clock.
He tends to tell lies.
I may have seen that girl somewhere.
We saw clouds above the mountain.
It's cheap.
I'm hungry. What about you?
You must be polite to your elders.
The muddy road ruined my new shoes.
Part of the roof blew off.
I don't remember seeing Tom.
The moon came out from behind the cloud.
I hope that you will get well soon.
"Could you pass me the salt, please?"
I like spending time with you.
This cat doesn't chase mice.
I'll do my homework.
Is this Tom's cup?
I'm sorry to trouble you.
She continued writing in her diary until she died.
Nobody can deny the fact the world economy revolves around the American economy.
Is this real?
I'd like to order the same.
What method did you use to give up smoking?
Tom is banging the skillet with a big spoon.
I will telephone you later on.
I'm on the balcony.
I hurt my leg playing football.
Do you often come here?
I don't like living in the country.
Tom is playing the lute.
I heard that a typhoon is coming.
We arrived at an agreement after two hours' discussion.
They never married.
Everybody seemed in high spirits.
Tom isn't interested in politics.
You can't separate language from culture.
"You forgot to invite Tom, didn't you?"
It's going to clear up.
Most of the soldiers were wearing camo.
I like you all.
Please turn the light off.
My birthday is in October.
Tom is a good kid.
Are you happy now?
"According to her, he won't come."
"I didn't know you could cook so well, Tom."
I'm used to getting up early.
Mary believes in the power of love.
My swimsuit is very tight.
"It's very humid, isn't it?"
What do you do on Sunday?
Does this look strange?
Tom stood.
Tom really wants to study French.
We found trouble everywhere.
Sorry I'm late.
She's about the same height as you.
This watch is broken.
Tom had a relieved expression on his face.
I drank too much coffee.
He ran away as soon as he saw me.
"It takes an hour to get there, at least."
Are your lips dry?
Do as you please.
I didn't know that you were so good at cooking.
The shrine was built two hundred years ago.
Come at any time you like.
None of us trust Tom.
Tom wore a hoodie.
Tom died in October.
I wonder what it's like to travel through space.
This song makes me think of when I was young.
"Yes, we can go."
Is your car black?
I don't care for ice cream.
Are you going to call Tom again?
I'll do it if you pay me.
I'm going to wash my hands.
Was Tom dating anyone?
I would rather walk than go by taxi.
What did you do today?
I can't help you because I'm busy.
This French textbook is Tom's.
It would be better for you to read more books.
The princess was beautiful beyond description.
What is the total number of students?
This is the TV station where my uncle works as an announcer.
I didn't know that you used to be a professional musician.
My eyesight is getting worse.
I get up at 6 o'clock every morning.
I'm going to leave early today.
Tom cleaned the toilets.
They are spraying the fruit trees.
Smoking is bad for you.
My father goes to work almost every day.
I don't have any money.
He is used to traveling.
It's none of your business.
All the buses are full.
It may rain.
Tom just changed his profile picture.
He traveled around the world.
Were you in Boston with Tom?
"You did tell Tom about that, right?"
Is it true you're going to Boston?
Does he live here?
I know you're here.
Is Tom busy?
What does that mean?
I can't find the car keys.
Mary is a tomboy.
They shot me.
Look at the price tag.
What a beautiful garden!
He gave a speech.
I was able to swim faster when I was younger.
Are Tom and Mary both still awake?
Stop making fun of me.
What time do you get up?
I'm going to Boston in the summer.
Where do I sign?
"When Mary and I were married, we used to go bowling with Tom and Alice."
Are you Tom Jackson by any chance?
That's highly unlikely.
You're a true friend.
Let me rephrase it.
She testified that she saw the man.
Tom won't come back today.
Who discovered the island?
I wonder if Tom will be late.
I'm afraid that we can't make up for lost ground.
What else does Tom need?
My computer doesn't work anymore.
Do you know kabuki?
Two thirds of the employees of this company are engineers.
The summer is over.
Are you allergic to any medicine?
I decided to subscribe to the magazine.
Just give me your name and address.
A sound sleep made me feel better.
I just got back from work.
Tom is a very clever boy.
I want to buy a hat.
Tom is my name.
Please cut me some slack this time.
He is cranky.
Give them to him.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
"If today was your last day on this earth, what would you want to eat?"
There's no time for explanation.
It's the tip of the iceberg.
I talked with our sales people.
English is not my native language.
There is no air on the moon.
Stop cracking your knuckles.
This melon will be good to eat tomorrow.
You need to take off your shoes before entering.
I sent you an e-mail.
Whose book is that on the table?
I can't get in touch with Tom.
Tom knew he didn't have much time left.
What are we having for dinner?
That's my line.
He dropped a vase.
Tom is small for his age.
Tom tried his best not to cry.
Thank you both.
The kids are sleepy.
You're not as young as I am.
I don't like the way he speaks to me.
Tom is talkative.
The soup is hot.
Tom hopes to live in Boston someday.
Do you go to school by bus or by train?
I was interested in your remark.
Tom looked like he was sick.
It's close to ten o'clock. It's about time we went to bed.
She had no sooner read his letter than she tore it up.
Call us.
My life is meaningless without you.
Glass is breakable.
The beaches in Hawaii are famous for their huge waves.
How's everything at work?
Should I put this bag under the seat?
The meeting was held behind closed doors.
Was Tom here today?
May I rest for a little while?
There's a hotel across the street.
Tom works on an assembly line.
Tom's comments are always to the point.
Tom doesn't like changing for P.E.
I really want to be a good teacher.
There are people waiting outside.
I'm not in the mood for beer.
A lot of people think that bats are birds.
What's new?
I stayed home all day long instead of going to the movies.
She didn't want to speak to anyone.
I just got back from work.
"If you hurry, there's a chance that you can catch the bus."
There are a lot of fires in the winter.
Smoking isn't good for your health.
I didn't get the joke.
I'm sorry for my bad French.
I told Tom that he should study harder.
I would like you to go instead of me.
"Tom has a ""don't rock the boat"" policy."
You should not trust him.
Tom waited for the kettle to boil.
The couple went off on their honeymoon.
Was Tom happy?
Tom is reading a newspaper.
Nobody else will make you a better offer.
Tom spends way too much time thinking about Mary.
"Our current house is too small, so we decided to move."
Have you ever been the victim of a violent crime?
Thank you for your support.
I think it's kind of stupid.
Don't interrupt me while I am talking.
Tom and Mary don't often eat out.
Rome was not built in a day.
I'd like to see you tomorrow.
I like your jacket.
I'd like to borrow about three hundred dollars.
How do I report a theft?
His house could be seen from the top of the hill.
Please return to your seats.
Is that Tom's bicycle?
Are you fond of music?
I attended the meeting yesterday.
She hit him.
Don't change your mind so often.
She remained single all her life.
Those three are his daughters.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his passport.
I'm feeling sort of tired.
"Suddenly, it started raining very hard."
Do you want one?
He fell off the horse.
Tom nodded.
Let's change the topic.
The sun hasn't come out today.
I'm busy this week.
The captain is responsible for the safety of passengers.
It's absolutely impossible.
I'll be back in three hours.
Who'll go there isn't yet decided.
Progress is monitored daily and stored in a database.
You still look like a high school student.
She was almost hit by a car.
Today's the coldest day we've ever had.
She seems to have no interest in soccer.
I have a lot of things to do.
I don't know anything.
Tom and Mary have three grandchildren.
I'll make an appearance soon.
"The first time I met Tom, I thought he was rich."
You are in my way.
I have some money.
I'd like to drink some water.
You've been missed.
We found some dead fish in the river.
I'm working hard trying to learn French.
Is today really Monday?
Tom apologized.
I have to stay at a hotel near the airport tonight.
I can't allow you to do that.
I am accountable to him for the loss.
Tom pulled his suitcase out of the closet.
Let's all go together.
My idea is different from yours.
Enter the password.
What is the name of that river?
Let's try this cake.
Tom's concert was very good.
We don't like rain.
He plays baseball every day.
First impressions are important.
The light is green.
I wish I could've eaten at that restaurant with you.
"Thanks. ""My pleasure."""
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
I like that idea.
Where's your other shoe?
Tom had a good reason.
The train came on time.
Don't bother Tom now. He's studying.
Sweet and sour pork is my favorite Chinese food.
I brought you some berries.
I worked all day and was very tired.
Some snakes are poisonous.
Let's put this money aside for our summer trip.
I'm in the same boat.
Which one do you think is correct?
I was involved in the trouble.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
"When I was a child, my mother made me eat green vegetables every day."
I wore black pants and a white T-shirt yesterday.
You forgot to erase your name.
That sounds good to me.
My daughter is often sick.
I reported the theft of my car to the police.
Tom and Mary broke up three weeks ago.
Thank you for your time.
You'll eventually get used to doing this.
I'll phone you when I arrive.
"If I had the money, I'd give it to you."
How's your family?
Honey on a muffin tastes good.
What are you writing?
Where is the nearest telephone?
I spent all morning helping Tom.
Aren't you ready?
School starts at eight-thirty.
What did Tom say about me?
He is afraid of his grandfather.
Where's the closest train station?
I'm sure she will turn up soon.
Let's put all the cards on the table.
Why don't we try calling Tom?
Are you going to see Tom tomorrow?
I've been thinking that I may have been too critical.
I'd like some aspirin.
Was it funny?
It's about ten minutes by car from here.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Tom arrived at 2:30.
You'll never be alone.
My aunt brought me some flowers.
I made friends with him.
"Hello, is this the personnel department?"
He is kind to her.
How tall are you?
Is that a cow or a buffalo?
Tom speaks poor French.
We have good news.
I could not understand anything he said.
"Meanwhile, you can get a little sleep."
Tom said he'd do it tomorrow.
I visit my grandparents twice a week.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.
Where can I buy a ticket?
Tom has been sick in bed for a long time.
They tore down the old house.
I jog every morning.
Tom goes to work by motorcycle.
He is of average height.
I'll make some coffee.
Are Tom and Mary on bad terms?
Tom doesn't like his nickname.
They went to church on Christmas Eve.
Running so fast is impossible for me.
Watch your head!
I've lost my new fountain pen.
I would rather starve than start stealing.
It happened that we were on the same bus.
"Somebody, open this door, please."
What did you put into the box?
"To tell the truth, I don't like Tom."
Let bygones be bygones.
He's standing on the stage.
The elevators in this building are often out of order.
We're finally alone.
I saw a jumbo jet take off.
Tom tried to break the ice.
Now stop crying.
It's so exciting.
We're pretty confident.
"The moment she saw me, she began laughing."
The old man lives on his pension.
How much is it for one person?
We'd like separate checks.
You should sue Tom.
It snowed a lot last night.
This is my aunt.
"All right, what's done is done."
She disappeared in the dark.
I thought Tom was a doctor.
There are many postcards in this store.
It's not healthy for you.
I agree with them that we should try again.
Didn't you lock up your car?
It must've been a shock to you.
How many handkerchiefs do you have there?
I wasn't invited to the party.
Tom is very kind.
I'm very busy.
I lost one of my shoes.
What would you do if you had a boyfriend?
Tom moved back to Boston to take over his father's business.
A nervous person will not be fit for this job.
I wrote a letter in English.
What is this fish called in English?
"Can you give me this one, please?"
I'll have to find a part-time job.
What a pity you can't dance!
I don't like him coming to my house so often.
I have to go home.
The dog ran after the rabbit.
I was very busy yesterday.
I apologized profusely for my being late.
We kept on working for hours without eating anything.
He traveled all over the world.
Hang it in the closet.
You need to eat more fiber.
You should stay in the hospital for treatment.
"Suddenly, it began to rain."
I was unable to go to his birthday party.
I won't tell you and Tom.
Are these for me?
I'm not going to fool myself.
She likes music very much.
I'd like to see the festival.
I don't like you any more than you like me.
I'm bad at reading maps.
Tom took the orange juice out of the refrigerator.
I got a lot out of that book I read.
I need hand lotion.
I'm off on weekends.
"Let's decide what needs to be decided, then let's split into two teams, OK?"
I'll show you how to do it.
I caught up with the others.
This drug only works for men.
I sometimes use scissors as a can opener.
We're going back to our hotel.
The house was surrounded by fields.
I told Tom that I needed to go home early today.

Clean the room.
"It is very cold today, isn't it?"
"If we don't thoroughly examine the cause of bullying, bullying will probably never go away."

"If you should have any trouble, don't hesitate to come to me."
Is anybody there?
Tom blushed.
Is this diamond real?
Tom said he thought Mary was married.
I can't remember.

The train leaves in ten minutes.
The moon is beautiful.
I'm too tired to walk any further.
Get out of here.
It's no joke.
I hope to see you soon.
My dog slept in the bed with me.
Tom said that he disagrees.
Everyone's hungry.
We look forward to working more closely with you in the future.

You shouldn't have done it.
The rain turned to hail.
I don't have a prejudice against foreign workers.
The news finally reached me last night.
There was a crash on Route 66 today.
I didn't even receive one letter from her.
I spent New Year's Eve with some of my friends.
Do you have any pets?
It isn't likely that she will come.
My kid is shy around strangers and always hides behind me.
I think we'll stay here.
They demanded a salary increase.
I made up with her.
I live in that house over there.
"By the way, I have something to tell you."
She has a round face.
Tom is a man that you can rely on.
It would be better if we didn't attend that meeting.
The rapid increase of imports surprised us.
I'm fixing the radio that I found on my way home.
It's an emergency.
I would rather stay home than go out with him.
Thank you for inviting me.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
I don't like waiting.
My hobby is collecting stamps.
A wise businessman knows how to clamp down on costs.
My brother was injured in the car accident.
"He looks a bit tired, doesn't he?"
I'm going to meet him tomorrow.
"It looks like snow, doesn't it?"
He was dropped from the team for using drugs.
"In case of fire, call 119."
That can't possibly be true.
I'd appreciate it if you would turn out the lights.
I don't feel any pain.
This is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen.
You don't have to do it now.

What kind of flowers do you like?
Tom is a professional killer.
He read the letter over and over.
Everyone's eyes were fixed upon her.
They laid the carpet on the floor.

I've got to talk to you.
People are afraid of change.
Somebody's standing at the gate.
What did he say?
Are you in the library?
I'm jealous because you have a good boss.
I can't speak Japanese.
The neighbor's dog often comes into our yard.
Someone is waiting for you downstairs.
The ice is two inches thick.
Tom sliced the onion.
I've been to the bank.
It took me three days to read this book.
I know Tom is miserable.
I'm in charge of the book department.
She's my best friend.
Would you mind if I turned off the radio?
Were you watching TV last night at 9:00?
I think that Tom is lucky.
She was promoted.
I can't understand anything he said.
This is the only possible time for doing that.
I take a walk every morning.
The new method was anything but ideal.
I have a gift for you.

Tom intends to live in Japan for good.
He quit school last week.
How do you like your eggs done?
I like swimming in lakes and rivers more than swimming in the ocean.
I wonder whether Tom was really at school today.
Tom's sisters are both beautiful.
Don't bite on the right side.
She is growing tall.
We're still planning to go.
I don't like his way of talking.
I was deeply moved by that.
This milk has a peculiar taste.
Let's go through the graveyard. It's shorter that way.
Does it hurt a lot?
Can you see the difference?
I thought that Tom lived here.
"Sorry, I forgot."
Is Tom suggesting that?
There was a silence.
Whose candy is this?
Please make yourselves at home.
Don't play in this room.
It wasn't until I got home that I missed my umbrella.
I wonder what happened to her.
A ship that transports oil is called an oil tanker.
I'm getting along with my mother-in-law very well.
Are you losing weight?
I get homesick sometimes.
Tom built this house.
Add a little more pepper.
Tom is an expert on the subject.
You can't blame yourself.
"I tried to open it, but I couldn't."
How many pairs of shoes do you have?
Japanese are Asians.
I didn't tell anyone.
May the new year bring you happiness!
I thought that you had to get up by 7:30.
What are you eating?
Did you see him go out?
Tom and Mary live in the same part of town.
Take away this box.
How soon can you have this dress ready?
Roses are beautiful flowers.
We saw him walking across the street.
He handed the salesclerk the money.
I like playing basketball.
Tom was a true hero.
I don't know what that is.
He called out for help.
My sister married a high school teacher last June.
She laid her head down on the pillow.
He made me out to be a liar.
Don't play with that key!
We cleared the street of snow yesterday.
I had never seen her before that time.
Tom was wearing a T-shirt and a baseball cap.
I saw you carrying Mary's books for her.
Your phone's ringing.
I know every inch of the town.
This is my son's CD.
I believe his name is Tom.
"Good night, Tom. ""Good night, Mary."""
I just don't get along with Tom.
It was just as I thought.
Is Tom still on the phone?
Let's quit here and continue tomorrow.
Are you in much pain?
I want something to eat.
He worked from morning till night.
This plate is broken.
She kindly showed me around the city.
Please let me know by phone.
It happened more than a year ago.
I had to drive myself to the hospital.
Take your umbrella with you.
I was a rich man.
Whose book is that?
He may be able to come tomorrow.
Hand in your homework by next Monday.
I see little of my father these days.
Have you seen any movies lately?
I want to marry her.
How's it going?
I'm going to change my shirt.
Let's buy half a watermelon.
It appears the storm has calmed down.
What is in the desk?
He got well again.
He loved her very much.
My grandmother lived with us.
He absented himself from classes.
Is this your wallet?
Is it over yet?
You'll be jealous.
It's time you went to the barber's.
It'll probably rain.
I was a freshman last year.
"Having seen him before, I recognized him at once."
Tom's house has a beautiful marble staircase.
The most important thing is the ability to think for yourself.
My father is at home.
She has never fallen in love.
The price doesn't matter.
I didn't think you were that kind of person.
The cost will run into thousands of dollars.
Go to the park.
None of the passengers escaped injury.
There is little food in the refrigerator.
The train has just gone.
What do you like about her?
You must not think about your immediate profit only.
I met your father once.
You're the best little brother ever.
"You can play this piano, but not at night."
I'll start working on October 20th.
May I go to the toilet?
He was run over by a car.
He ran for his life when the bear appeared.
I have a lot of things I have to do before tomorrow.
He can't count.
Please be careful.
Tom ate my sandwich.
Are you going to buy that dress you were looking at yesterday?
That movie was shown on TV.
"May I go, too?"
Who ate the cheese?
This bread is very good.
"It's been a while, hasn't it?"
What can you see?
Tom washed Mary's car.
Please sit down.
"You're really a hopeless idiot, aren't you?"
Please think nothing of it.
I wouldn't bet on that horse if I were you.
Zimbabwe was once a colony of Britain.
This is your book.
Take a look at this report.
How many appointments do you have tomorrow?
Don't ever touch my things again.
It's way too cold to swim.
I asked Tom to send us the book.
Don't forget to take an umbrella with you.
Tom opened a book.
I apologized profusely for my being late.
There's only a week left before the examination.
Go back to your seats.
"I hear there are many foxes in this area, but I rarely see any."
She always wears fashionable clothes.
We enjoyed watching TV.
"The program should have started by now, so we'll probably miss the first half."
Tom has a wife and kids.
Tom is an intelligent child.
I dropped the glass.
He predicted there would be rain.
The cherry trees are in full bloom now.
My kid is being potty trained.
Thanks for letting me stay with you.
We've known each other since childhood.
Japan's population is smaller than that of the United States.
I think I'll take a bath tonight.
I expect that he will help us.
We will have an English test next Monday.
Everybody is afraid of Tom.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
This is where my father works.
"The bus now arriving is going to Domestic Terminal 1. Passengers for the International Terminal, please wait. The shuttle bus to the International Terminal also leaves from this stop."
What's wrong with running around your house naked?
It's cold in this room.
Is it contagious?
Are you going to Tom's party?
Tom turned the light on.
I do that once a year.
The old man named the wooden doll Pinocchio.
I am free till 6 o'clock this evening.
I ate two apples.
It isn't so far.
I really want to sing.
It's a shot in the arm.
Tom is working hard to improve his English.
Use this.
He is an expert at solving such problems.
That's hard.
The population of Japan is larger than that of Canada.
I found the test difficult.
She has had quite a lot to drink.
It's natural for you to think so.
He's a strange person.
I'm sad.
Did you know Tom was writing a novel?
"Who's that? ""It's Tom."""
We drank all night.
He did not like children.
Those towels should be clean.
Most young adults enjoy going out at night.
Bring Tom back.
Wash your hands before meals.
I didn't think that you were supposed to be here.
Tom has a loose tooth.
Do you put milk in your tea?
"You can dance, can't you?"
We were confident that we would win the game.
I'm against the war.
My wife is also a scientist.
"Are you new, too?"
Are you free after school?
Our cat is fat.
I deleted my Facebook account.
Wait. Don't go.
Tom gave his three-year-old son a puppy for Christmas.
I suspect that Tom doesn't like Mary.
I finished reading the book last night.
This building is unsafe.
She keeps secrets.
A year has twelve months.
Did I hurt your feelings?
You're lucky. The plane arrived on time.
I think she is over forty years old.
It doesn't hurt.
Let's split the bill.
It'd be better not to go there.
Who's on duty today?
"I left home later than usual, but fortunately I was in time for the train."
Are you talking to me?
I was walking in the park with a friend of mine when it started raining.
The nurses are very nice.
I have almost no information about the problem.
Tom and Mary know that John is smart.
Tom noticed that Mary was sitting in his seat.
Ten policemen were assigned to patrol that area.
Tell me what you saw.
Look out!
The dog chewed up my boot.
You had better not tell your father about the accident.
Tom's homeless.
Would you like another piece of pie?
Let's go somewhere.
There isn't anything in the refrigerator.
You can ask him for help.
Is that where you intend to go?
That child is a bit shy.
I sometimes dream of home.
The jet landed at Tokyo.
I can understand French to a certain extent.
What is the most popular movie now?
Tom speaks French to his children.
It's getting better.
He acquired French when he was young.
I paid about fifty dollars.
I love my work very much.
Some people were kind and others were unkind.
I'll give a speech tomorrow.
The rain changed to snow.
He returned to his native village.
They smiled at each other.
That wasn't hard.
What time is it there?
Our dog is really cute.
Is it true Tom can't speak French?
"Where's Tom? ""Cleaning his room."""
The weather is supposed to go downhill starting this afternoon.
Don't you have any money?
I told Mary I wanted a divorce.
Can you turn the television off?
Can anyone here speak French?
You said you wanted to be a teacher.
I'd prefer not to take that risk.
Why did you decide to study French?
I'm pretty sure that Tom will be hired.
Do you know how much it costs?
Where can I use this gift certificate?
Be nice to your little sister.
I wonder if there is any reason to translate this into French.
Is Tom from Boston?
He bought a pair of shoes.
I've decided not to go to university.
I don't get what you mean.
The snake swallowed a frog.
All I have is a book.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
I was tricked by Tom.
Tom looked up at the sky.
You should have told me in advance.
Both Tom and I are drunk.
It is time to reflect on your past.
She ordered a cup of tea.
Is Tom still in Australia?
I work at an airport information desk.
"I'd like coffee rather than tea, please."
I had a hard time trying to talk him out of taking the trip.
It was a fine day and there were no clouds in the sky.
I don't like silence.
I've finished all except the last page.
Choose carefully.
This mouse suddenly stopped working.
I like spring the best of the seasons.
Tom has leukemia.
Someone needs to talk to Tom about what happened.
Tom said Mary seemed drunk.
Push the red button if something strange happens.
Every student in the class knows that fact.
I'd like to meet your older sister.
Who were you speaking to on the phone?
People gather around here when it gets dark.
He begins to sketch no matter where he is.
"At night, the trains run less frequently."
Why don't you hang around a while after everyone else leaves so we can talk?
Tom doesn't know the answer yet.
Were you in Tom's room last night?
"Since he was very drunk, he couldn't drive his car home."
We finally arrived at the lake.
Tom was bitten by a mosquito.
Can you do it in one day?
It took a whole day to paint the picture.
Those look like rain clouds.
I looked around for a mailbox.
This camera is less expensive than that one.
Which one of the two do you think is right?
You look pale today.
I'm up.
"I've taken medicine, so I'm fine now."
Don't be long.
Breathe through your nose.
"May I see your passport, please?"
I'm busy with homework.
The assignment took me longer than I had expected.
Children are playing behind the house.
I can't find my slippers.
I've been working since I was sixteen.
Tom isn't an interpreter.
Try it once more.
Charge this bill to me.
I really do hate those.
I teach English to the second year classes.
Your question isn't relevant to the subject.
"She shouted for help, but no one came."
The mountain is covered with snow all the year round.
Tom lived in a residential area.
This fruit is edible.
"I'm not disturbing you, am I?"
I'm still on duty.
I'll look it up in the dictionary.
There's almost no chance this team will win.
It's impossible to do the sights of Tokyo in a day or two.
"It's OK, isn't it?"
Tom didn't regret his decision.
Tom has a longer beard than John does.
I keep a gun in my car.
This soup is too salty to eat.
A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
Who pushed you into the pool?
"If you're not going, I'm not either."
I heard that Tom got married to a rich woman.
You're supposed to come in person.
"Do you not like Tom? ""It's not that I don't like him, I just have trouble dealing with people like him."""
You are hearing things.
It smells delicious.
Tom gave Mary a kiss on the forehead.
These mushrooms are poisonous.
Tom held his hands in front of the heater.
Is there a doctor on board?
I'm sore all over.
"If you were to fall from that bridge, it would be almost impossible to rescue you."
I had a good time yesterday.
She managed to learn how to drive a car.
I have no experience.
Tom was too shy to take part in games with the other boys.
"Is she coming, too?"
"He's somewhat hard of hearing, so please speak louder."
I've already talked with Tom about that.
Tom was in a bicycle accident.
Tom only eats fruit.
"I'd like a window seat, please."
"When it rains, she feels blue."
I thought you'd be in Australia this week.
It was because of the accident that I was late for school.
"Like father, like son."
Tom's French got better after he started studying grammar.
My gas bill for last month was very high.
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
Who taught you French?
We were just eating lunch.
Don't make Tom cry.
"I got up early this morning, so I'm more tired than usual."
I think that Tom should eat more.
I'm relaxing at home today.
"When I opened the curtains, it was snowing."
It was already dark when I got home.
I have a feeling that something dreadful is going to happen.
I invited scores of people to my birthday party.
Tom's parents love me.
I don't want to go anywhere this evening.
Would you hold on a minute?
He was deeply moved by the story.
This game can be played by young children.
Are you serious about what you're saying?
I had a phone call from him.
Would you like more soup?
What time are you open until?
I want to buy Tom a piggy bank.
There are people who can't admit they're wrong.
I want to go to America.
I need to call the cops.
I have the feeling that I've heard that. before.
I heard her singing.
Tom almost never watches TV.
He had no choice but to run away.
Tom finished.
I told her not to go.
I called my lawyer.
"I saw her for a moment, but then lost sight of her in the crowd."
Tom started to eat before Mary sat down at the table.
Someone stole my belongings.
I'll phone you later.
Get it ready at once.
The children started bouncing up and down on the couch.
Tom can't tie his shoelaces by himself.
I bought a house with the money that I inherited from my grandfather.
That's why I didn't want to come here.
"Even though it was a big mistake, no one's talking about it."
There are several customers in the restaurant.
They are both in the room.
Will it be much longer?
How do you want them?
I'm leaving town for a few days.
Does she have enough energy to take a long trip?
What Tom said made sense.
Tom commutes to work by bus.
This national park is full of beautiful scenery.
"When I got home, my mother and father were quarreling."
Are you just going to stand there all day?
"Not knowing what to say, I kept silent."
May I take a few days off to visit my family?
Don't mix business with pleasure.
It's time to go.
The curtain caught fire.
I'm working now.
There is one thing I don't understand.
She is able to grasp the situation.
My uncle has three children.
I wonder if exchange students can join this club.
Come and have tea with me.
He was always pulling my leg when we worked together.
I can't bear the pain.
"Some water, please."
I still haven't checked my email.
"It's OK with me if we barbecue, but I don't like it when smoke gets in my eyes."
The Tokyo stock market recorded an unprecedented loss.
I had a phone call from him.
"If you have gum in your mouth, spit it out."
A dog was running after the cat.
Tom said that he's always lived in Boston.
Does Tom play squash?
I went to visit my grandfather's grave today.
Have you ever been abroad?
This picture is of my uncle.
I'll leave this work to you.
Today is Saturday and tomorrow is Sunday.
That's not what I meant.
They chatted over coffee for more than two hours.
I forgot to lock my bike.
He'll have an accident one of these days if he keeps driving like that.
What movies have you seen recently?
Our fridge broke.
I have no intention of selling it.
I felt much more relaxed.
I tossed the ball to Tom.
George W. Bush was born in the state of Connecticut in 1946.
"No, thank you."
Let's rest here.
It was a long war because neither side would give in.
His advice encouraged me to try it again.
It seems that the diamond is real.
I have yet to hear that story.
This is the only book I have.
Now lie down.
London is one of the largest cities in the world.
Tom left some food for Mary.
We may not win tomorrow.
He invested his money in stocks.
Tom jumped into the lake.
My father drives to work.
They have very little to live on.
You are requested not to smoke.
I'll pay.
Please wake me up at 6:30.
The birds were flying in a group.
I don't think that Tom likes Mary.
Have you ever been to Australia?
Commodity prices were rising.
The sun has just come up.
I'm going to stay with my aunt in Boston.
I've been waiting for you for a long time.
How long does it take to walk from here to the city hall?
Turn the light on. I can't see anything.
This dog looks sick.
Didn't you know Tom is a French teacher?
Tom didn't buy anything for Mary.
Don't touch the flowers.
I want a sandwich.
I love onions.
What is done cannot be undone.
This is how to cook rice.
I prefer working to doing nothing.
Look in the mirror.
I was given the task of cleaning the office.
All hope is gone.
"As far as the eye could reach, there was no sign of life."
We'll take off in a few minutes.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
Tom is depressed.
"In our society, there are both honorable people and swindlers."
"Both Tom and Mary are in the living room, watching television."
I would like to go with you.
I have a sore throat.
I'm sorry I can't go.
It shouldn't be like that.
Did you ask Tom?
I forgot to bring my ID.
"Anything else? ""No, that's all."""
Put your pants on.
I've been bitten by mosquitos all over my arm.
My favorite color is blue.
This food is too salty.
Don't cry. I'll buy you a new one.
Can you account for all the money you spent on your trip?
She was very strict with her children.
He is a fast speaker.
Do you think he did the job on his own?
Give it another go.
"I'm worried, too."
He doesn't look his age.
I walked to school.
He lost his job.
"I'm the type who gets nervous in front of people, so I'm bad at speech making."
Where did I put the key?
I like coffee better than tea.
"I spoke to him in English, but I couldn't make myself understood."
He told me he was going to America.
This sentence can be interpreted in two ways.
Could you please tell me your name?
Please call me at any time.
We won.
I'll go and get it.
What's the capital of Australia?
I painted this picture.
I hate stupid people.
Could you help me solve this problem?
Is anybody hurt?
He doesn't have any common sense.
He accurately described what happened there.
He was living with the Indians.
Don't panic!
I am the fastest runner.
He timed her in the marathon race.
Did you guys have fun?
I'll bring the book back to you tomorrow.
Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
Listen carefully.
Did you plan it yourself?
I had a funny dream last night.
My bag was stolen.
I can't see the price tag.
I'm looking forward to it.
Is the flight on schedule?
I hadn't bargained on such a heavy traffic jam.
Our trip was canceled due to the heavy snow.
I graduated from high school last year.
Are you a lefty?
I'm sorry for being late.
That sounds interesting.
I want to clean my room.
There were lots of people in the stadium.
I have high blood pressure.
It's only a five-minute walk to the school.
"If you have any questions, just ask."
"That's an interesting remark, but it's beside the point."
Where can I buy tickets?
The wind is getting stronger.
I am leaving next week.
Let's ask the teacher.
Can I rent rackets?
That'll cost thirty euros.
We each drank three cups of coffee.
Did you hurt your back?
Let me think it over for a couple of days.
There's snow on the mountains.
Was that my phone ringing?
Line up in single file.
Why were you absent from school yesterday?
A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes.
He was wounded in the head.
Tom is the one who told me to read this book.
My dad helped with my tie.
It was Tom's first time to see the Golden Gate Bridge.
Where is the lost and found?
Tom's a liar.
She got her left hand burned.
This sofa takes up too much room.
His team is likely to win.
Wait a minute.
He parked his car behind the building.
Have you lived here a long time?
I'm not sure Tom did that.
I'm allergic to seafood.
We had coffee together.
I think I miscalculated.
A lot of cars speed by on this expressway day and night.
Tom told me he had a dream about Mary last night.
Thanks for the good advice.
Have you ever been to another country?
"What's important isn't the goal, but the journey."
Please pay attention.
Tom adopted our method of bookkeeping.
Were you watching TV last night at nine o'clock?
I have nothing to do with that.
"If it's a simple piece of music, I can sight-sing it."
Where'd you get it?
I didn't order fish.
We're familiar with that author's name.
I'm a cat person.
He grits his teeth and forces back his growing fear.
Tom doesn't know how to dance.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
Is it for here?
My father often goes abroad on business.
What do you think of his new novel?
Tom is good at swimming.
I have no excuse.
Tom didn't drink that milk.
How did Tom find us?
We often hear it said that Japanese are good workers.
Please don't forget to turn off the light before you go to bed.
The plane was on the point of taking off.
Could you give me a hand?
Pick a number.
I've just washed the dishes.
I have an idea.
I did everything I could.
I am engaged to her.
This isn't what I ordered.
The game wasn't exciting at all.
Tom can understand a little French.
Did Tom object?
He is angry with you.
Why did you come to Boston?
You have to have a piece of pie.
I had never thought of that before.
I'm a policeman.
Children grow up quickly.
"He took her in his arms to help her, but she couldn't stand."
She got a slight burn on her hand while cooking.
I shouldn't have sent that email.
We should leave before it starts raining.
Is this what Tom wants?
Do it at once.
Tom showed up 15 minutes late.
That isn't original.
I'll talk to him at the earliest possible moment.
The weather got cold.
What's that?
Carry these books back to the bookshelf.
Our dog has been lying in the sun all day.
I'll play a sonata for you.
"Cold this morning, isn't it?"
It's fun to ride a motorcycle.
Birds were singing in the woods.
The servers are down.
Tom isn't thirty yet.
Both French and English are spoken in Canada.
It was an excellent performance.
I don't think that it's a problem anymore.
It was seven thirty.
Tom flew to Australia last Monday.
You can't use this faucet. It's out of order.
"Thanks, Tom."
I never thought this would happen.
There is no wine in that bottle.
We should've phoned ahead and reserved a table.
Let's have a little break.
Tom works at a music store.
Everyone in our class passed the exam.
Can it be phrased in another way?
What should I do now?
Shut all the doors and windows.
I spent the whole day playing with my kids.
This size is too large for me.
Tom wouldn't laugh at something like that.
The story was very interesting.
"Walk two blocks, and turn left."
You're not supposed to wear lipstick at school.
Don't be a wallflower.
Does this medicine actually relieve pain?
This bridge is made of iron.
Power and money are inseparable.
Your answer doesn't make sense.
Are you going to shower?
The columns were made of marble.
I'm absent from school on occasion.
You must not look down on old people.
The car kept swerving from lane to lane.
Children like drawing pictures.
They had trouble finding the place.
The waves are high today.
Tom said Mary was likely to be arrested.
I don't understand German.
It's starting to get cold here.
We have no extra money.
Tom is in a very good mood.
Tom looks very happy.
My association with him did not last long.
This bag is too heavy.
It happens.
I programmed my first computer game when I was twelve years old.
Our living room gets lots of sunlight.
"If you happen to hear of anybody that wants to buy a house, please let me know."
Tom unfolded the camp chairs.
Tom doesn't do it much.
Get out.
Are you still in contact with Tom?
Can I use this shopping cart?
Why didn't you call anybody?
Our section chief always makes a face at me when I ask him for something.
Several students were absent from school because of colds.
We had a little water.
He sleeps during the day and works at night.
What a beautiful flower!
We would like to stay here tonight.
It's past your bedtime.
Tom ruined my weekend.
Could you drive more slowly?
Tom dug a hole with a pick and a shovel.
I never thought that day would come.
It isn't OK to smoke here.
He is the captain of the team.
I can't feel my legs.
Have a nice time.
Many paintings hang in art museums.
The game will be played rain or shine.
A meter is not quite equivalent to a yard.
I study English at home.
I took it upon myself to telephone the police.
A fire broke out last night and three houses were burnt down.
I've never seen a cat this cute before.
"I have to lose some weight, so I'm on a diet."
Tom would like to live in this country.
You're forgetting something.
It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
"Beef, please."
I go every year.
Thanks for yesterday.
Two nurses attended to the patient.
Please tell me when he'll be back.
"If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know."
I had to work overtime yesterday.
"Good job, everyone."
Are you going to join the glee club?
Oh my gosh! You're the last person I expected to meet in a situation like this.
There's no way Tom knows Mary.
I broke the clutch pedal.
I've waited for more than a week.
I was born in Tokyo on the eighth of January in 1950.
Which season do you like the best?
Will you please shut the door?
I've been walking for over four hours.
"Once upon a time, there lived a cruel king."
I'm sure Mom will get mad.
Look at the seventh line from the bottom on page 34.
Tom has a loose tooth.
I nearly left my umbrella on the train.
I met her by chance.
Can I park here?
Are you still in high school?
Tom might need your help.
Did you get good marks?
How long does it take to walk to City Hall?
Tom graduated three years ago.
You'll never know unless you try.
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
I'm sure that Tom is aware Mary is in the hospital.
Are my socks dry already?
What do you take me for?
"I'm a bit busy now, so go to the other room."
She is always cheerful and smiling.
It's wrong to lie.
Tom happened to meet Mary at the supermarket.
My coworker really knows how to suck up to the boss.
Such a remark is open to misunderstanding.
"To the airport, please."
I'm not used to being laughed at.
I'm not busy now.
This isn't a dating site.
He's absorbed in his work.
I've never seen it like that before.
We can cure some types of cancer.
I've already told Tom I plan on staying in Boston for another three weeks.
Both Tom and Mary are fast asleep.
I never thought that day would come.
They demanded the king be put to death at once.
It's hard to maintain one's reputation.
He had worked for the law firm for six years.
How are you doing these days?
Tom left the room.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
She's a bad cook.
Don't pretend you don't know.
He is the principal of the high school.
"Tom doesn't take a walk every morning before breakfast anymore, but he still does several times a week."
I was mistaken.
I wonder whether or not Tom has seen this movie.
The issue of Third World poverty is very pressing.
The word has several meanings.
I didn't kill anyone.
He had friends all over the world.
I have been to the barber's.
She has a good reputation.
I do not need money now.
Shut up and eat.
He has accumulated wealth.
I can't stand guys like that.
Think about what you say before you say it.
I showed him into the room.
Where are you headed for?
I've had enough.
He is generous with his money.
Today is not your day.
The door was still open.
Be quiet.
This box weighs a ton. What's inside?
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
She gave up her seat for the old person.
Look at that guy. He's really cute.
You shouldn't smoke here.
She doesn't speak English as fluently as you.
I want to participate.
Will you have another glass of wine?
Tom sat down on the bench.
I think either one is OK.
Mary broke up with the boy she had been dating.
A window was broken.
Tom isn't welcome here.
I'm going to be in Boston next Monday.
Taking a taxi is a luxury for me.
I got everything I wanted.
Is he tall?
I'm busy preparing for the trip.
You're a real pain.
"I'm just looking, thank you."
I've spent all my money.
"In case something goes wrong, please take care of my children."
Tom stood up and walked to the window.
Your French pronunciation is horrible.
It makes a difference to us whether it rains tomorrow.
Is this your first trip abroad?
Try to avoid making any more trouble.
My backpack is very heavy.
They're tired.
What language is that?
Please don't encrypt your file.
People do not know the blessing of good health until they lose it.
Do watch your step.
I rarely read books in French.
I barely made the 9:20 train.
She altered her plans.
His behavior was anything but polite.
He was foolish enough to believe it.
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health.
Bring me the key.
The bicycle I had used for many years was stolen.
"Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful princess."
A cat came out from under the desk.
I think he is right.
Where's the museum?
"His name, I believe, was Tom."
"I don't want a big, fancy wedding."
What's in your fridge?
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
The pond is very deep.
Please let me know if it hurts.
He achieved his goal.
Let me out.
I come from Australia.
What's the difference between these two?
"Because of Tom's advice, I was able to succeed."
I gave him a ride in my car last night.
It is I who am to blame.
Was that Tom on the phone?
We're professional photographers.
I am interested in swimming.
We had a mild winter last year.
Get over here.
You made it with time to spare.
It isn't good to force our ideas on others.
There are exceptions to every rule.
Tom and Mary rarely talk about money.
My sister is not a high school student.
He always keeps his word.
Summer is my favorite season.
Tom opened the safe and took out his passport.
"Tom spent fifteen minutes trying to pry open the drawer with a crowbar, but he couldn't get it opened."
Tom is always courteous.
"I have a car, but I rarely use it."
"No, I'm not a teacher. I'm only a student."
My son is taller than me.
I've just come back.
May I open the curtain?
This problem is difficult for me to solve.
Children generally have a higher body temperature than adults.
He continued to work.
I hope you're fine.
"If I'd noticed, I would've told you."
I'll give you moral support.
"Yes, my father is already retired."
The bridge saved them a lot of time and trouble.
I don't like doctors.
You seem to be a little under the weather.
My hometown is in the center of Hokkaido.
"Gee, I wish I had that problem."
Don't sell that.
I washed my T-shirt.
Does Tom disagree?
Tom is still a teacher.
Did you go to the top of the pyramid?
Won't you have some more coffee?
Tom ran away from home at the age of thirteen.
The question is who's going to tell Tom.
Give him time.
Let's hide behind the curtain.
This house is too small to live in.
The only thing we can do is wait.
I don't know if I can take it anymore.
Please step back.
Are sandwiches OK for lunch?
Will you teach me how to make this?
I thought that I'd never be happy again.
She has two thousand books.
Tom isn't as patient as Mary.
I have three older sisters.
I'm afraid you have to work overtime.
How much did it cost?
I want to become a doctor in the future.
I'll try it.
It tastes really yummy.
She hurried to the station only to miss the train.
I only got a short glimpse of the thief.
Has anyone seen my badge?
It would take forever to explain everything.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
They washed themselves in the river.
That's not nice.
Didn't you know Tom was rich?
That bank was held up twice.
His illness comes of drinking too much.
You should have breakfast every day.
The teacher wrote English sentences on the blackboard.
He's a big show-off when girls are around.
There was an earthquake this morning.
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
He slept all day.
She is certain to be surprised.
He climbs trees easily.
I go for a walk every morning.
That's not my cup of tea.
Fill in the blanks.
Playing the guitar is fun.
I had to look after the children.
May I be excused?
You didn't need to come.
Here's my wallet.
The train station is close to the hotel.
I'm not going to hit you.
Stop acting like a child.
It's not a crow. It's a raven.
We knew it all along.
She has a lot of money.
The bus was two minutes early.
A bear can climb a tree.
These girls are more charming than the ones I met yesterday.
I wish I had been a bird.
Tom is going to join our team.
Close your eyes.
I want to go out with Tom.
Don't you watch TV?
I remember what I ate.
I'm watching television.
It was a heartbreaking story.
Sorry. The train was late.
You've been missed.
It's too hot today.
Do you have anyone to look up to?
We have respect for our teacher.
You should fix your tie.
I know Tom personally.
Put the gun on the table.
"As a rule, we don't allow smoking."
"Is it all right if I join you? ""Of course."""
Everyone was having fun.
This isn't the first time.
"I have to go to the bathroom. ""Me too."" ""We should've gone at the station."""
You can call me any time.
I'd love to come with you.
What on earth is the matter?
How much does a case of beer cost?
"If it snows a lot tomorrow, let's make a snowman."
Is this your first trip to Boston?
I can't take any more.
Wholesale prices are basically flat.
The only thing he's thinking about is seeing her.
Where's my bottle?
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
I can't lift this box.
Is it true Tom and Mary are going to get married?
Everyone always speaks well of Tom.
I wish I could remember people's names and faces.
Lawyers are all liars.
I got my son to repair the door.
What on earth are you looking at?
"Tickets are valid for just two days, including the day they're purchased."
Tom respects Mary a lot.
It's about time you got married.
Tom should eat.
I would appreciate hearing from you soon.
Aren't you the lucky one?
Can you give me a hand with this table?
He is what is called a gentleman.
Forgive Tom.
It was really close.
It'll be fine tomorrow.
None of my friends play golf.
I got this book for nothing.
I went there by bus and train.
I don't remember his name.
There are a lot of fish in that lake.
I'm not that good at goodbyes.
I'm afraid that we won't be able to help you tomorrow.
I am here.
You can't be a blood donor.
How was your weekend?
I fell asleep with my contacts in.
"Yes, I can do it, answered the boy."
This was a bad week. My train was late two days in a row.
We have to defend our country from the foreign aggression.
Do you study French every day?
Why is it so hard for you to be nice to your younger brother?
Can you break an egg with one hand?
I'm tired and I want to go home.
Tom is looking for a lawyer.
Does she like oranges?
The girls were sitting right next to each other.
I suggested that we go fishing.
Are you hiding?
Come pick me up.
Tom usually eats lunch at Chuck's Diner.
Be good.
Dinosaurs once ruled the earth.
Do you believe in God?
We went to the beach last weekend to swim.
How about staying with us for a few days?
Relax and breathe slowly.
What is the reason you want to enter this college?
Are you sure this is Tom's?
May I have a cup of tea?
I feel the same way.
I've lost my watch.
I thought you'd be angry.
"They were, for the most part, college students."
Tom isn't as active as Mary.
I didn't know Tom smoked.
The waves are high.
I want another cup of tea.
Do whatever you like.
"I'm sorry, but I can't accept such an expensive gift."
Tom drew a picture of a dolphin.
Tom was worried that his cat would never come back.
That painting is a copy.
Drink this.
I'm not very good at playing the guitar.
"Right now, I'm eating dinner."
An expert was called for advice.
Attach labels to all the bags.
Are you on crack?
I don't know the exact place I was born.
Tom was beaten.
I have a bad toothache.
"I felt guilty, even though I hadn't done anything wrong."
I asked him if he would go there the next day.
Is it still windy?
What have you been doing recently?
I'm sick of eating codfish cakes.
I don't like talking about myself.
My grandfather was part Indian.
He came home late in the evening.
I don't have any money and I don't have any friends either.
I'd like you to itemize the charges.
He acknowledged me by raising his hat.
I am not accustomed to walking long distances.
It's not easy to teach French.
That's just my personal opinion.
Those are my lines.
I was injured while I was skiing.
Tom is a neurologist.
I'm surprised to see you smoking. You didn't use to.
Tell Tom.
"You're being bossy, aren't you?"
New facts have been brought to light.
Two students are absent today.
There's no turning back now.
I've never seen Tom that mad.
Let's rent a bike there.
You'd be amazed how often Tom doesn't do his homework.
Were you watching?
Tom can sing some French songs.
Give me a sip of that.
The radio is broken.
Are you hard of hearing?
I am anxious about your health.
I wouldn't do it even if I could.
Here's my phone.
There are too many things to do.
We talked all night.
I decided to do it on my own.
What's the name of this river?
"Tom has one, too."
What are Tom and Mary doing here?
It's time you went to bed.
I concentrated my attention on the lecture.
I've never tried this.
Is that Tom's phone?
I'm rich.
No wonder she didn't show up to see him off. They broke up.
Please have a seat here.
I'm studying to be an artist.
I think that's where Tom works.
That noise woke me up.
Have you had dinner?
"When he spoke, everyone became silent."
Is this illegal?
I haven't talked to anyone lately.
"She tried to lift the box, but found it impossible."
What is your new friend's name?
Tom is sitting at his desk.
Is this store open on Sundays?
He turned his coat inside out.
You're talking nonsense.
His parents told him to get into a university.
Thank you for coming to meet me.
Let me hear it.
I think that what you're doing is right.
She is used to living alone.
That student is very active.
There are cherry trees on both sides of the street.
Tom started the engine.
I like being home.
I'll buy that.
Keep children away from the pond.
I'll give you a call when I get home.
I'm looking for a sweater.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why's Tom so suspicious?
"Tom didn't call you, did he?"
"I like playing tennis, though I'm not very good at it."
Don't worry. You can count on me.
Don't forget to take the first-aid kit.
I thought that you were good at French.
Please tell me your present address.
There isn't much difference between the two.
How about going out for dinner?
Is that Tom's bedroom?
Do you know where Tom is?
I get the feeling I'm sleeping too much recently.
Did you get your wish?
It's a holiday tomorrow.
He can swim like a fish.
I hate all of them.
No one lives in this house.
It's raining hard.
I agree with your interpretation to a large extent.
"Well, see you later."
Your blouse goes beautifully with that skirt.
Stock prices fell sharply.
Is Tom still going to do that?
Your cellphone's ringing.
I'd appreciate it if you could do that.
Could you please tell me why you love her?
I watched it on YouTube.
I don't think Tom is selfish.
Please don't tell anyone.
Wires are used to convey electricity.
It's all the same to me.
This is a bit too tight around my neck.
Do you have a question?
This will come in handy in a pinch.
She is afraid of falling ill again.
Should I reply to his letter?
There is a book on the desk.
I got blisters from the burn.
The only drummer here is Tom.
Tom is shoveling snow outside.
Are you through with the book?
I'm off duty now.
I walk to school every day.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Tom woke up when the piece of chalk that the teacher threw at him hit him.
What's the admission fee?
I was rich at the time.
When can we see each other again?
I hope to see you soon.
Tom took the bottle of Scotch from his briefcase and handed it to Mary.
This picture reminds me of when I was a student.
She failed to appear.
I don't want to go to school.
Don't throw trash here.
I've never met him.
I often catch colds.
The travelers came from many lands.
That sort of thing won't happen.
Do you have a daughter?
Do you know who invented the telegraph?
I have to leave early tomorrow.
The teacher treated all the students fairly.
The sun sank below the horizon.
You look happy today.
He's a fine young man.
It's 3:30.
I went to the hospital.
Tom grabbed his bag.
Are you interested in volleyball?
Seoul is the capital of South Korea.
Have you ever been to America?
There used to be a large park here.
He has taken over his father's business.
Did you know Tom at that time?
Please close the door quietly.
Are you a high school student?
I've been there already.
Tom is kind.
Mary couldn't do what she should've done.
What is GNP an abbreviation for?
I go to a driving school.
You can count on her.
It's past my curfew.
Add one teaspoon of paprika.
We arrived on the morning of the twentieth.
I'm afraid that I have to go now.
What are you good at?
Turn to me for help if you are in difficulty.
Tom is rather optimistic.
Could you elaborate?
Hurry up! We're all waiting for you.
Child abuse is a crime.
Mary can speak French almost as well as she speaks English.
His hands had turned blue because of the cold.
I get two hours' exercise every day.
I try.
Please shut the door quietly.
Are you taking notes?
I think Tom is patient.
Let's get started.
The cat was hiding in the bushes.
I want these.
Are you sure it was Tom who did that?
I was invited to the party.
What do you do after school?
The milk froze and became solid.
My father made a shelf for me.
This is a very good question.
I'm free right now.
You've got to be careful or else you'll miss it again.
This pizza is terrible.
Something may have happened to him.
He is good at baseball.
That isn't what I believe.
Get out!
"My mother disliked caterpillars, not to mention snakes."
Tom planned to kill Mary.
Are you all doing well?
Both Tom and Mary were wearing seat belts.
Blood circulates through the body.
I don't know for certain when he will come.
This watch is waterproof.
Tom forgot to buy a present for Mary.
Ask Tom if he can play the piano.
Let's split the bill.
"My bag was here five minutes ago, but it is gone now."
I tried not to cry today.
Customers came one after another.
Do you ever get told that you look like someone else?
What do you want?
Tom always seems to find something to complain about.
"It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters."
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do.
I want to buy this skirt.
Don't you have anything to do?
Don't say such things.
I want money.
Tom's novel has been translated into French.
The results were unbelievably good.
This park is famous for its cherry blossoms.
We returned to camp before dark.
Do you know whether she can speak English?
Tom is filthy.
Is that a zebra?
You shouldn't ask personal questions.
They must've been tired.
I went fishing with my brother in the river.
Tom towel-dried his hair.
This dress is too big for me.
Please call me before you come.
I've made up my mind.
Where can I buy a ticket?
Never keep a lady waiting.
I thought that you said you used to live in Boston.
"At last, he came."
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
I'm terrible at math.
You look good in black.
Take this medicine after meals.
Have you ever visited Australia?
"After the rain, there were puddles on the street."
I was wrong.
It isn't my problem.
How tragic!
Would you mind giving me a ride to the post office?
Tom was kicked off the bus.
Don't view opinions and facts as the same thing.
I've already done it.
He was alarmed by the explosion.
"Unable to accomplish the task by himself, he turned to me for help."
She has ten children.
I'm just happy to be here with you.
Tom works at a nuclear plant.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Are you sure it's safe to eat this?
My sister takes piano lessons twice a week.
I want you to come at once.
Tom seems to have recovered.
Why are you so tired today?
You ought to be ashamed.
That is an incomplete sentence.
He showed off his new car.
This classroom is very large.
What are you waiting for?
I've got a cold sore on my lip.
What's the temperature?
Cucumbers are related to watermelons.
I don't want to see you again.

You shouldn't do such a thing.
Please be gentle.
Cooking is interesting.
When will the rainy season be over?
This money needs to last us until the end of the month.
This is a present for you.

I think I need braces.
I can understand why you don't want to eat there.
I drank milk.
What's your occupation?
Choose one.
That figures.
I was thinking the exact same thing.

Excuse me for opening your letter by mistake.

We set out on our journey full of hope.
Tom handed me a sandwich.
The time has come when I must tell you the truth.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't like raw eggs.

Would you like another apple?
Keep your eyes open.

Can you fix this?
I think it's somewhere around here.

Tom disappeared.
You should definitely come.
What am I to do now?
Tom was left alone in the room.
"If you have a question, please raise your right hand."

Not all of these eggs are fresh.

Don't forget your ticket.
How did you spend your winter vacation?
Are you still living in Australia?
Why are you so tired?
Did you want me to do something for you?
"Hurry up, and you'll catch the bus."
Are you busy this coming Monday?
Is that nearby?
She answered in tears.
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my speech.
Black absorbs light.
When does the rainy season in Japan begin?
It's gotten dark.

What a beautiful town!
When and where did you buy that?
I lost ten kilos in three months.
I thought that I recognized Tom.
I don't know his name.
This is yours.
"The check, please."
Who is that lady?
I don't want to go to Australia.
I'd like to think about it a little bit longer.
Why did Tom tell you?
"You came by train, didn't you?"
I forgot to bring sandals.
"Wait in line, please."
I'll be there until 2:30.
Did you get everything ready for tomorrow?
You are not supposed to smoke here.
I can't sleep because it's too bright outside.
Here is a letter for you.
I've quit smoking.
That was good.
None of their promises have been kept.
Don't fight.

"In my opinion, she is correct."
I couldn't see anything.
Tom left without looking back.
Tom and Mary live in the biggest house on the block.
Would you like to come to my parents' house?
This is wine.
I hate cleaning and doing laundry.
Don't push yourself too hard.
I was a little surprised at the question.
You could see the entire city from the top of the Ferris wheel.
You can't have it both ways.
Is Tom better at swimming or skiing?
Tom wanted to meet you.
He is married with two children.
Someone must've left it there.
He runs fast.
I had a sandwich for lunch.
I hope you've learned something from your mistake.
This is a great apartment.
I'm the baby of the family.
He arrived safe and sound.
Is this umbrella yours?
"Tom, do you have school today? ""No, classes were canceled because of the typhoon."""
This dress suits you well.
Have you completed your homework?
How did your interview go?
He was too tired to go any farther.
I can see why you like Tom.
Don't make me laugh.
The pleasure is mine.
I used to go skiing a lot.
We found out that what he said wasn't true.
Let me know if I need to make any changes.
Which side are you on?
She thought that I was a doctor.
I played tennis and went swimming during my summer vacation.
Those women are strong.
Are you still cold?
"Do you have some fish? ""Yes, I do."""
You can have this book for nothing.

I don't think it'll rain this afternoon.
We'll never meet again.

Did you go fishing last weekend?
I feel like vomiting.
Stay home.
I am through with my work.
I borrowed money from my father.
I never want to see you again.

That was close.
A book is lying on the desk.
Don't phone her now.

Nine players make up a team.
"Oh, let me show you."
You can take either road to get to the park.
Watch out! There's a big hole there.
You dropped something.
The weatherman says we'll have rain in the afternoon.
How about dining out for a change?
I appreciate your coming all the way.
It's annoying.
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.
Tom never lies to me.
It's cold there even in the summer.
Look! There's a bird in that tree.
Keep away from the fire.
We know that she was born in Canada.
Tom doesn't want to take such a risk.
I gave Tom three cookies.
The class starts at ten.
"It tastes very good, doesn't it?"
"It's not what you wear, it's how you wear it."
"To tell the truth, I've already seen that movie."
He whispered something to her.
There used to be a big cherry tree behind my house.

I can't put up with him.
My mother doesn't speak French.
Could you please go to the supermarket and buy me some butter?
Tom misses you.

There's one just near the station.
You'd better do it right now.
I have a broken ankle.
I'd like to sit near the front.
I figure my vote won't change anything.
I'm going to the bank.
Tom is agile.
"All men have some natural talent, but the question is whether they can use it or not."
I'm charmed to meet you.
I don't feel like talking about it now.
How do we get out of this situation?
"If Tom calls, tell him I'm taking a nap."
You're smart.
Stop smoking.
I would rather not go.
Where in Australia does Tom live?
The novel has been translated into many languages.
My nose is cold.
Take down the main points of the speech.
Where's your house?
What's your favorite color?
"Mom, I'm sorry for causing you trouble all the time."
Tom caught a cold from Mary.
I'd like to do that today.
I am familiar with the way he asks questions.
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
Are you busy today?
Don't make noise when you eat soup.
I'm very glad to see you.
Baseball is an interesting sport.
I'm playing baseball now.
I'm famished.
I don't like going to bed early.
Let's keep in touch with each other.
I did it without thinking.
She tends to be late for school.
Tom is at home now.
I've already returned the key.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
I wanted my freedom.
That kind of thing isn't important.
Where is the bus terminal?
Tom can't swim yet.
You're working too hard. Take it easy for a while.
The bad weather prevented me from going fishing.
The children were busy preparing their lessons.
I think it fits you well.
She looked at me.
I'm sorry to bother you.
She is kissing him.
Would you help me clean the bedroom?
Tom was caught sneaking out of the room.
She can speak French fluently.
I'll do that as soon as I get home.
Don't rely too much on others.
"In case of fire, break the glass and push the red button."
Our dog is in the kennel.
I don't know much about computers.
I just don't get the way that men think.
Tom kicked Mary in the shin.
"You've never dated anyone, have you?"
He seldom breaks his promise.
"He practices the piano every day, so he can become a pianist."
I went shopping twice today.
She was hard at work writing letters.
Tom has a brother who is an architect.
It is getting warmer and warmer.
He can't be trusted.
Was that Tom?
Please put on your shoes.
The recreation area remains open to the public.
We'll have a good crop if this good weather keeps up.
My father got home late last night.
Someone is playing the piano.
I stopped smoking and drinking.
The weather's nice today.
"If not now, then when?"
Where does Tom plan to stay in Boston?
This is more fun than doing homework.
It was very hot yesterday.
Why is Tom living in Boston?
It looks like today isn't my lucky day.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom has been following me around.
I like cats a lot.
I spoke to him on the phone last night.
Won't you have a seat?
It's dangerous to walk around here at night.
I racked my brains for an answer.
"We had a dog, not a cat."
It suddenly started raining heavily.
"In Japan, it's very hot in the summer."
I got up at seven this morning.
Tom told me he's puzzled.
Would you like to go see a movie with me?
No problem!
You should've seen that movie.
The arrow hit the target.
We just want you to come back.
They say they don't need money.
Dinner will be ready by six-thirty.
I appreciate your advice.
Tom wasn't there at the time.
What beautiful weather!
Tom is the one who gave me this apple.
Tom and Mary are both unmarried.
We can't meet your demands.
I pushed my bicycle home.
Your shoes are here. Where are mine?

Would you like something to eat?
She's gained weight.
"Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can."
A friend of mine invited me to dinner.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
Please write with a ballpoint pen.
There were a good many candidates for the position.
"Open the door and let me in, please."
Don't try doing two things at the same time.
Would you lend me your knife?
I didn't go with her.
She is apt to win the prize.
This money will allow me to buy a car.
I know Tom is a painter.
He made several corrections.
I think that watching TV is a waste of time.
"Thanks, Tom. I had a wonderful evening."
You can't fool me so easily.

The candy store is closed.
Get out of here. I don't want to see you again.
I'll come and see you at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
Isn't that dangerous?
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my presentation.
Three men escaped from prison yesterday.
Maybe I don't want to know.
Are you from around here?
Could you translate this sentence for me?
His eyesight is bad.
It's homemade.
The budget passed the Upper House.
"In the 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons adopted Roman characters."
We used up the shampoo.

I'll finish it as quickly as I can.

She is wrong.
Great! Let's get together sometime.
Are you upset?
Some things are better left unsaid.
Please tell me what I should do in this situation.
I'd be fired if I kissed Tom during working hours.
I got up so an old man could sit in my seat.
Maybe Tom is waiting for Mary?

Keep in touch!
The teacher had her eye on me because she thought I was cheating.
"Thank you, Doctor."
"Tom thinks of Mary as his girlfriend, but Mary doesn't think of Tom as her boyfriend."
Let's forget about yesterday.
I didn't know anyone in Boston when I first moved here.
The house stands by itself.
We're so busy we'll take any help we can get.
Tom is talking.
It's a nice day.
He came out of the room.
Just stay at home.
I think it's better not to do it.
I bought a computer.
Let's give it a try.

Our team did very well.
Are you fond of swimming?
Excuse me.
Thank you for your consideration.
Tom has asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
"Tom is rich, but he's not happy."
How about you?
She had white shoes on.

I never imagined anything like this.
Have you read this?
Almost all of us can speak French.

I sat next to the driver.
Could you please show me a camera that's cheaper than this one?
"Some like tea, others prefer coffee."
Tom is in a lot of trouble.
I can't understand why Tom is so upset.
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
It's only four minutes from here by train.

I want to have a talk with him.
Whose is this?

"In June, it rains day after day."
Tom gave a big yawn.
I am not a teacher.
You should eat something.

This is exactly what I wanted.
Who broke this?
I have a deposit of a thousand dollars here.
"As far as I know, the rumor isn't true."
I won't ever talk in class again.

I have a lot of things I want to do.
I'm not sure that I can convince Tom.
Which of you will try it first?
Who told you that?
My doctor advised me to give up smoking.
Why he killed himself is still a mystery.
Don't be a fool.
Do you like to draw?
Have I told you this before?
A man like that gets on my nerves.
The party is today.
Birds sometimes cause accidents by getting in the way of airplanes.

She is very busy.
How many hamburgers did you buy?
I think that I should do it for you.
Tom may be frightened.

"On the average, I go to the movies once a week."
Do as you please.
He was out of breath.

Play outside instead of watching TV.

"On the way back, I was very scared."
I'm scared of bats.
You never can tell what's going to happen.
It's not easy to understand his ideas.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do such a thing."
Tom was still dubious.
"You're a professional, and I'm an amateur."
Tom isn't as intelligent as Mary.
It was a lot of fun.
"Excuse me, may I borrow a pen?"
"Hold still for a moment, please."
I'm going to try.

I got stuck in traffic.
Can you really speak ten languages?
Where's the ticket counter?

I'd like to reconfirm my reservation.
I think Tom was busy.
Both Tom and Mary were born in Boston.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
Please don't tell your parents this.
Tom keeps a pair of binoculars in the glove compartment of his car.
I make a point of getting up before six.
He stopped smoking because his wife and children asked him to.
He's tickled pink.
You shouldn't judge a person by their looks.
We must start at once.
"It's kind of iffy, don't you think?"
Would you please come again later?
You left the refrigerator open.
Tom isn't interested in Mary at all.
There's no hurry.
You should take the shuttle bus.
I'm very afraid of snakes.
A very good thing happened today.
I can't afford a car.
I don't feel like eating anything now.
I couldn't stop crying.
Can you keep it a secret?
What is the difference between this and that?
Is it morning already?
I forgot to tell you that.
Did Tom eat dinner?
I'd just woken up and was still drowsy.
I can't stand babies crying.
How many people were on that ship?

Soon your efforts will be rewarded.
He reads a lot of books.
What do you call this bird?
I'm being patient.
The rain is likely to continue.

This is very good.
Tom needs time to do that.
He ordered a cup of tea.
The sick man required constant attention.

Do you have any food allergies?
I think that Tom is still home.

The participants were for the most part women.
She called him.
The cat is black.
He can run 100 meters in less than twelve seconds.

I wish Tom hadn't told Mary I'd been in prison.
"The book doesn't have a title, yet."
"I don't like it, either."
Do you have anything to declare?
We locked all the doors.
Brush your teeth.
Please let me go home.

Tom wrote Mary a letter.
This ball is that boy's treasure.
I've lost my credit card.
The village which I visited last summer was a small one in Nagano Prefecture.
A man stood waving his hand to me.
May I turn the light on?
There are many things we need to discuss.
Whose seat is this?
I need to send a fax.
They are about to start.
They're eating apples.
You're nuts!
I forgot my homework.
"Because of the heavy fog, we could barely see the road in front of us."
The police have surrounded the building.
I swear that I'll wait for you.
A recession is bound to come next year.
I can't afford a new car.
You'll get used to it in no time.
I think I have tendinitis.
I intend to carry out this plan.
Is this Tom's office?
My grandmother loves watching TV.
The wind is picking up.
I want to die.
My father works at a bank.
He's scared of that dog.
My room faces the garden.
He lives apart from his parents.

We have a big supermarket.
I think you're wrong.
I never should've gotten married.
I am taking a holiday at the beach.
I'll try.
How many times have you been there?
I don't understand why we have to do this.
I feel like another person.
Try to have some fun.
They vanished.
I owe him my life.
It never ends.
Have fun.
What time will the meeting start?
Tom went over to Mary's house for Thanksgiving dinner.
This is what they call a lucky break.
He is bad at driving.
I'm sorry. I don't have a lot of time.
I feel feverish.
We got lost in the forest.
I knew we were going to win.
Is there a doctor in the house?
What're you two doing?
Are you on your own?
I suggest that you go and see a doctor about this as soon as you can.
Did you buy some flowers?
Turn him down once and for all.
He thought of a good solution.
"After a six month period, his leg was healed and is normal again."
Can you show me how to make it?
Do you have an elevator?
Can you arrange these flowers for me?
He wouldn't be caught dead playing pachinko.
I expect that Tom will pass the exam.
Who did you want to talk to?
I don't have to wear glasses any more.
This is Canadian money.
When did you buy that hat?
Are you calling me a thief?
What're you waiting for?
I just want to talk.
Do you want this door closed?
Was the soup tasty?
This is ridiculous!
I'll do it today.
Bicycles keep to the left in Japan.
I am looking for a present for my mother.
I can't find what I want.
The summer vacation is only a week away.
I'm not sure I can convince Tom.
I need to go home a little early today.
It's sunny today.
"Press the green button. If you do so, the light will go on."
I wasn't scared at all.
"Would I only work on weekends if I could? Of course, I would."
Please wait until I have finished writing this letter.
Yesterday was very hot and humid.
Here's the address.
I don't think it's odd at all.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
"If I were you, I would trust her."
I'm looking for my phone.
I bought a box lunch at the station.
She pulled him out of the mud.
Is Tom allergic to anything?
It stinks.
Do you mind my sitting next to you?
He managed to be on time for class.
Tom took a seat next to Mary.
A strange thing happened.
Let me tell you an amusing story.
How does the song go?
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave.
Did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?
Tom wanted to spend New Year's Eve with Mary.
What time is it now?
I am no longer a child.
This is new.
What are you doing here?
I enjoy traveling.
How many steps does this staircase have?
She has a bath every morning.
"If we hurry, we'll make it."
I don't think that Tom will be successful.
"My wife usually doesn't drink coffee at night, and neither do I."
She's going out to buy some things.
"Tom, what do you want to be when you grow up?"
Tom is my half-brother.
It's hard to communicate.
I'll go look for those.
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
Tom stood right behind Mary.
Are the preparations for tomorrow complete?
She is in the bathroom.
I haven't received a reply yet.
He didn't want to part with his house.
Tom blacked out.
We had a good time yesterday.
Tom was the one who taught me how to play tennis.
She is in need of help.
I hope your wishes will come true.
My father bought a new car.
He made a will last year.
I'm not ready to go.
Tom visited the Colosseum in Rome.
There is no atmosphere on the moon.
I don't want to hear any of your complaints.
Close the door when you're in the bathroom.
My older brother often stayed up all night reading novels.
How much time every week do you spend doing fun stuff with your children?

What sports do you play these days?
He talked to the chairperson.
A snowslide obstructed the road.
I study English half an hour every day.
I'll buy you lunch.
I want something to read on the train.

The music added to our enjoyment.
"In addition to a thick fog, there was a heavy swell."
Is there any help available?
"In my spare time, I read books."
What do you think of this outfit?
I can't bring myself to do such a thing.
He burst into laughter.
He lives close by.
Tom swims better than Mary.
Almost all of the dogs are alive.
It was a very hot night.
I think that it's unlikely that Tom will get back in time for supper.
My brother is a high school student.
Tom says that he only eats organic food.
We have to get Tom to a doctor.
It's our first lesson.
Thank you for the wonderful gift.
Thanks for always helping me.
My brother works part-time in a library.
I work in a factory.
The other day her mother passed away in the hospital.
I wish I could swim.
Have you ever kissed another guy?

I put honey on my peanut butter sandwich instead of jam.
Do you think that I'm too tall?
Where are the girls?
I don't know what I should say.
It was because of the accident that I was late for school.
Will you have some coffee?
What's your father do?
Those headphones make my ears hurt.
Tom will have breakfast early tomorrow.
"If it's a good day tomorrow, let's go to the river to swim."
I felt so refreshed after a swim in the pool.
She divided the cake between the two.
What time does it close?
Canada is larger than Japan.
Who gave that to you?
That'll do.
This is a joke.
There's nowhere else to park.
Who wrote you this letter?
This is a picture of her.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
The heavy snow made them put off their departure.
I didn't mean it.
John met Mary on his way to school.
She was impatient for him to return.
I'll come to your house later.
She hardly talks at all.
He often thinks with his eyes shut.
He left his family and went to live in Tahiti.

I am not a morning person.
We'll be late if we don't hurry.
Don't be silly.
I finally was able to find out where Tom lives.
She's still under age.
I don't know what plan he will try.
This hat cost me $10.
I have one big brother and two little sisters.
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
I make it a rule to read books in the library on Saturday.
"Despite his riches, he's not contented."
Is there someone here that speaks French?
I've been angry with Tom.
Tell Tom that I'm going with Mary.
Why didn't you believe me?
We've run out of paper for the photocopier.
Tom told the police what happened.
Tom will forgive you.
Are you going to invite Tom to the party?
Children under 18 are not admitted.
This one is a lot easier.
He has no money.
I tried solving the problem.
Here is a present for your birthday.
Tom and I went to the same high school.
I'll buy this bag for you.
Tom hasn't been helping us.
Time passes quickly.

Tom put on a brave face.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
He has the large room to himself.
I do my best.
It's very odd.

That's a good plan.
"An orphan at three, he was brought up by a distant relative."
It sounds great!
He jumped to the conclusion that I had done it.
Is it OK if we change the subject?
That's the reason he became angry.
I went for a drive to clear my head.
I'll attend the meeting.
We can't start second-guessing ourselves.

Is Boston very far away?
How about going on a picnic?
You must eat.
Never play on the road.

The children are beginning to get out of hand.
He read the letter with tears running down his cheeks.
"You're really popular, aren't you?"
The voice reminded me of my mother.
The problem is who's going to tell Tom the truth.
We had a math test today.
"In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is."
This is not very stylish.
Is it already open?
You don't have an alibi for the day of the murder.
I don't know which button to push.
Please speak in French.
Now it's our turn to do that.
Tom tries to not eat junk food.

You'll be shocked to hear this.
Who built your house?
The people on the island are friendly.
Can you come?

I'm feeling a little guilty.
I'd prefer not to call Tom. I'd rather write him an email.
There's nothing to eat.
I congratulate you on passing the examination.
I met him on my way home from school.
I also work on Sundays.
"I listened, but I heard nothing."
You ought to know.
I repeated what he said word for word.
Are you going to sing?
I like your ideas.
Tom is making faces at me.
We're still planning on going.
He looked up at the stars.
I shouldn't have drunk so much.
A white dove is on the roof.
I don't care for him.
She threatened him.
"I saw her five days ago, he said."
Look at that pretty little girl.
I got sunburned.
"You're an early riser, aren't you?"
I've heard the French version of this song.
I'm a bit of a reader myself.
It may snow in the evening.
Tom caught the mouse.
It's too heavy. I can't lift it.
It looks like you've put on some weight.
Why do you want to leave today?
I don't want to do that.
They seem to be in love with each other.
"Don't just eat fish. Eat some meat, too."
I want to do this myself.
I've lost my keys again.
My mother hates writing letters.
I want to have a proper house and garden.
Get a move on.
Don't eat the wrapper.
How do you account for this situation?
How are you?
That's the way it is.
We live in the country during the summer.
The lights were on in the room.
"Today's a bit hotter than usual, don't you think?"
I don’t want to buy that durian.
Tom taught French.
I started learning Chinese last week.
Shut the book.
These headphones don't work.
Who do you think will come first?
Whose baby is this?
"No matter what happens, I'm not changing my mind."
My parents aren't old yet.
It's normal.
Tom had never realized how attractive Mary was before.
Where can I park?
She's still dependent on her parents.
This beer isn't cold enough.
That won't change anything.
I wish I could go to the concert.
Have you already eaten something?
I've seen that.
Is eating pork a sin?
Stop flirting with Tom.
I thought I smelled bacon.
Feel free to get yourself a drink if you are thirsty.
Have it your way.
Tom acted like a hero.
I just don't care.
I was reading a book at the time.
He ran so he would get there on time.
You seem busy.
She has gone to America.
It would be great if you could join us for dinner.
Who do you want to talk to?
Please forward my mail to this address.
She was transferred from the head office to a branch office last month.
I don't use Facebook.
I'm a university student.
Tom lives in a house on the edge of the village.
Tom had a hunch that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
Are you the one who called the police?
Put the car into the garage.
I was born and brought up in Tokyo.
"No pain, no gain."
Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?
I'm not as poor as you think I am.
"For a while, I was really addicted to cola and drank it every day."
He complained about the room being too hot and humid.
She was crying as she answered.
I always drink milk with my breakfast.
This pear smells nice.
Your skirt is out of fashion.
I was expecting you last night.
She is a reliable person.
There was a heavy rain last night.
She helps him.
Tom can't swim like he used to.
I like dogs very much.
Stop doing that.
I appreciate all you've done for me.
Tom had his wisdom teeth removed.
Is that too much?
I wish you'd come sooner.
Really?
Are you really going to do that?
You should have left half an hour earlier.
You should think before you begin to speak.
Tom and Mary have only one daughter.
Tom thought Mary was nervous.
I'd like to read some books about the Beatles.
It's been a while since we last met.
Don't be cruel to animals.
I saw nobody around.
The graduation ceremony will take place on March 20th.
"If there is anything you want, don't hesitate to ask me."
My watch is more accurate than yours.
You're a good boy.
I was nearly hit by a car.
I don't know the correct answer.
Are they sisters?
The new bridge is in process of construction.
I haven't checked my email yet.
Tom is a coward.
She gave him a sweater.
I'm not the same person I was when you first met me.
I thought that that was my job.
Come and see me tomorrow.
How long is this visa good for?
"You can't swim, can you?"
I don't feel like telling her about it.
Did you buy a washing machine?
The train was almost an hour behind time.
He's worried that he might be late.
The weatherman says there is a storm on the way.
Every member but me believes what Tom says.
What's new?
What're you good at?
How much is this sofa?
This dress is a good bargain.
"Tom was supposed to call Mary last night, but he forgot."
"Wouldn't it be great if a gender-neutral pronoun for ""he"" or ""she"" existed in English?"
The opposite sides of a rectangle are parallel.
Please give my regards to your mother.
Are you sure Tom can swim?
"I didn't know where to go, or what to do."
Tom made up his mind to become a teacher.
He was very poor.
I still have a lot of work to do.
I felt a drop of rain on my head.
I wasn't able to catch up with Tom.
I don't like them.
Tom doesn't do anything without his wife's permission.
He divorced his wife last month.
Won't you have another cup of coffee?
French is not at all a difficult language.
A meter is 100 centimeters.
I'm going to try again.
Are you going to take the entrance examination?
Tom didn't need an interpreter.
It's Tom's favorite French word.
"Whatever happens, keep calm."
"When he was in the military, he conformed to the strict army rules."
He couldn't sleep because of the noise outside his window.
That's pointless.
Horses eat grass.
I'm not in the mood to do that.
I can sleep anywhere.
"You'll have to do it, whether you like it or not."
Tom has a Ford.
Is anyone there?
Should I watch my diet?
It's important to take it easy and rest when you're tired.
Watermelons are in season now.
Tom's not in the office.
There is a little time before the train departs.
Will you please lend me a stapler?
He made me go against my will.
Do you know how much it costs?
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
They found the stolen money.
I'm feeling a little nervous right now.
I take a break every three hours.
I work hard and play hard.
Is that tall man this boy's father?
Why do we need money?
"Excuse me, can you tell me the way to the library?"
Come here. There's something I have to tell you.
I guess I'm never going to get married.
Who's standing there?
This fish is delicious.
This is a roll of toilet paper.
I went bungee jumping for the first time today.
When did you buy your car?
Skiing is one of my hobbies.
I still haven't decided where to go.
Tom is graduating this year.
Our teacher is going to the USA next month.
This isn't my day.
"Although he had many toys, his greed made him want more."
Cats like playing in the sun.
When's that novel going to be published?
Why don't we eat pizza for lunch today?
I've always wanted to meet you.
I've just finished breakfast.
The Gettysburg Address is a concise speech.
The new students entered the hall full of hope.
You can count on me any time.
The Tokyo stock market recorded an unprecedented loss.
You look gloomy.
He threw the ball against the wall.
Let's put a stop to this discussion.
I'm not a coward.
You don't say.
Could I try to do it?
I know what your game is.
Tom gave the manila envelope to Mary.
Mt. Fuji is Japan's most famous mountain.
I've seen it.
I want to open my own restaurant.
"It looks like a dog, but I don't think it is."
Is it true that Tom was in Boston last week?
Why don't you go home early today?
Speak up!
You can tell Tom what you want.
Am I clear?
The train was delayed by snow.
Beat it.
That sounds good to me.
Tom is very good at sports.
I wonder whether or not it'll rain tomorrow.
I'm very happy to see you.
An old woman was burnt to death.
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea?
Where did my homework go?
This isn't what I ordered.
He is an expert at fishing.
I thought that Tom was still in jail.
Politics didn't interest him.
I feel nothing at all.
I love this video.
I should have listened more carefully.
I'm a morning person.
He comes here twice a week.
Tom wasn't badly injured.
They've already finished the work.
I came to apologize for what happened yesterday.
I don't know what happened.
I sat waiting on the bench.
Is the milk good?
That's not what he said.
Space travel is dangerous.
Has Tom tried that?
"If it rains on that day, the game will be postponed until the next fine day."
Life's short.
What kind of mistakes did you make?
We'll make you happy.
Tom said he didn't have anywhere to go.
Don't do anything stupid.
I learned how to ride a motorbike when I was sixteen years old.
I study Korean.
He quit without notice.
Give me a different one.
I can walk to school in 10 minutes.
There is no cause for undue alarm.
Should I help Tom with his homework?
I'll leave the decision to you.
What do you think about that?
"If you need an umbrella, I can lend you one."
"I've apologized, so lay off, OK?"
I'd never before seen this species of fish.
I've been friends with Tom for many years.
Tom has very particular tastes.
I think Tom is in.
Strangers close by are better than family far away.
Tom yelled.
They replaced the broken television with a new one.
I wonder who this bicycle belongs to.
He answered incorrectly.
Tom could do that again.
Look at that shooting star.
I'm not scared of anything.
It's OK to cry when you're sad.
Are those people over there your friends?
The goldfish are all dead.
What high school do you go to?
I enjoy movies.
The novel was written by a well-known American author.
You see what I mean?
Were your mother and father home?
Tom's parents are from Australia.
Roast chicken is one of my favorite dishes.
There are a lot of problems that we can't avoid.
Tom was selected.
Do you know what you're asking?
I've got a cold.
They set about building a house.
I'm not so sure about that.
How did you reply?
Nobody came here.
You have to get up early tomorrow.
There was no water in the river.
I plan to get a hold of Tom by phone tomorrow and ask him to help.
Tom was wearing a T-shirt and a baseball cap.
Phone me when you've finished.
We used to live in this house.
Don't play in the road.
Would you like to eat with us?
You shouldn't judge people based on their names.
I'll take care of the dog till tomorrow.
Tom has nothing to be afraid of.
He likes playing soccer.
Come soon.
I often have nightmares.
Tom is our interpreter.
"If a porter carries your luggage, don't forget to tip him."
The ice cracked under the weight.
Well begun is half done.
Give it to me!
I saw Tom yesterday evening.
It's going to rain.
"In all of my travels, I have never seen a more beautiful mountain than Mount Everest."
She was going up a ladder.
I rarely go to the movies.
I can't remember what his name is.
"Show me how to do it, please."
Tom hasn't yet told Mary he got fired.
Thousands of people became victims of this disease.
Come to my house.
Tom fell asleep watching the Olympics on TV.
Tom was already drinking his third beer before Mary had even finished her first.
Are Tom and Mary still in Boston?
Can I ride this horse for a while?
Even my mom knows.
I think we'd better wait for another thirty minutes.
Keep your fingers crossed.
They invited me to play cards.
They have a less selfish reason for trying it.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Please give me something to eat.
It's quarter to eight now.
Don't leave the bathroom in such a mess.
He finally got his wish.
What do you call the last day of the year?
I've got it.
My mother didn't mention it.
Tom watched the squirrels play.
We still have plenty of time.
I fear nothing.
Why do you walk when you have a car?
You should tell him about that in advance.
It's getting cloudy. It may rain soon.
The view is beautiful beyond words.
He has powerful arms.
She invited Tom and me to the party.
I was in the bath when the phone rang.
I can't help feeling sorry for the girl.
What were you doing down there?
What is your occupation?
Thousands of people became victims of this disease.
They grow strawberries in their greenhouse.
She spends a lot of time practicing the piano.
I have a bad cold.
I've never felt like this before.
I'll cook dinner tonight.
Can you hear anything?
I wasn't aware that you were feeling so bad.
I don't know the exact length of this bridge.
"I'm sorry, this painting is not for sale."
This is the garage key.
He remained poor all his life.
He got rich.
I wouldn't want anyone to read my diary.
What did you think when you actually met me for the first time?
Look behind you.
I really do hate it.
Many people were killed in the accident.
My father told me about his experiences during the war.
The twin girls looked so similar that I couldn't tell them apart.
She put lots of sugar in the coffee.
My car is being fixed now.
They were never to return to their country.
Tom has a few friends in Boston.
I can't remember his name.
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday.
Have you ever tried windsurfing?
You look very pleased today.
Who gave you a nickname like that?
I cry whenever I listen to this song.
Is Tom back?
"I'm so sorry, but I forgot your name."
Tom is a very polite man.
I have caught a bad cold.
This road is closed to traffic.
"You aren't coming, are you?"
I'm just asking questions.
Put your teacup on the saucer.
Are seats available?
Where do you want to sit?
Shut your big mouth.
Can you give me a ride to the station?
Giant pandas live only in China.
The students are looking forward to the summer vacation.
"Meanwhile, you can get a little sleep."
I heard that Tom crashed the party.
"If you'd listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'd probably be able to understand."
I didn't know that she had a child.
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French?
"You come, too."
Loving is the essence of life.
Let's run away together.
We should respect the ideas of others.
Tom is too old.
"He got up quickly, splashed cold water on his face, brushed his teeth, and shaved."
You need to respect the elderly.
She's weak by nature.
Tom suddenly realized he wasn't alone.
I'm sorry to trouble you so much.
Tom went to bed.
Mary is hanging up the laundry.
I didn't say I liked Tom.
Nobody believed you.
"Tom sprang out of bed, threw on some clothes, ate breakfast and was out of the door within ten minutes."
I've been waiting for Tom for an hour now.
Let's chuck it.
Let's go to a movie.
I never dreamed that I would meet you here.
What was Tom doing in Boston last week?
There's no way I can finish this by tomorrow.
The fridge was completely empty.
Tom gave a vague answer.
Who's your French teacher?
School starts at 8:40.
Don't you want to go?
I couldn't help laughing at the sight.
I've bought a lot of books.
Tom was cooking the books.
Where did you go for vacation?
This magazine is widely read.
When will you go shopping?
I learned that when I was in kindergarten.
You're acting like a fool.
Please wait. I'll bring you a towel.
Is there a dress code?
All the lights suddenly went out.
How much longer are you going to be sitting here?
You must've been working too hard.
I take a walk every day except when it rains.
There's very little paper left.
He who hesitates is lost.
Something bad may happen.
That's wrong.
Sales tax isn't included.
Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
I'll just introduce myself.
The deer was running by itself.
The printer ran out of ink.
I taught French for three years.
Don't worry. I'm used to it.
Who knows?
My mother stays at home every day.
We live in the atomic age.
Where are you scheduled to visit?
Tom's engaged.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't want to read this book.
I'm tied up now.
He has ten cows.
There is a bench under the tree.
My father made a shelf for me.
Does Tom know?
Our school library has many books.
Tom's clothes were shabby.
I drank some green tea.
I'd like some information about your new computers.
I don't watch TV at all.
He swam across the river.
Is it far from here?
Do you have any French wine?
Tom opened a bottle of wine.
"Good job, everyone."
That was a close shave.
You are no longer a child.
Let's inquire about our hotel reservations.
The earth is a beautiful planet.
I woke up with a headache this morning.
I go shopping every morning.
It's been ten years since he died.
Mary spread the big map on the table.
"Can I have the menu again, please?"
Money does not always bring happiness.
The divorce rate is expected to rise.
"I can't sleep. ""Me neither."""
Feel this. It's really soft.
There's something I want to show you.
He is absorbed in the study of linguistics.
Is this motorcycle Tom's?
Will you go over my plan?
This is not a sentence.
I really love my work.
There was a tape recorder on the table.
"Which do you prefer, tea or coffee?"
She always stood by me.
Keep on smiling.
I hit Tom.
Let's play chess.
Who lives in the room below?
There's no chance that he'll recover.
I have to get more sleep.
There is a vase on the table.
I couldn't control my anger.
I ran as fast as I was able to.
The wall clock doesn't work.
Why has the birthrate declined so sharply?
"If you keep trying, you'll get better at it."
I can't check my mail. The server is down.
Please return what you have borrowed.
I can't make heads or tails of what you say.
You can't buy these in a store.
I caught a glimpse of him in the crowd.
Please don't do anything today.
Is Tom a vegetarian?
I wasn't expecting so many people to come.
It is not too much to say that he is a genius.
I'm so busy I have no time to read.
Look! There goes a shooting star.
Tom is trying to make the impossible possible.
I've heard this before.
That is all right.
Tom could do that by phone.
My French is still not very good.
"If I were you, I'd paint it blue."
He didn't say a word.
Have you ever lost your wallet?
"The people crowded round the injured man, but they made way for the doctor when he reached the scene of the accident."
You don't need to go see it.
A stranger spoke to me on the crowded bus.
Tom and I are both painters.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
Mary slapped Tom.
I'll be late.
A bullet pierced the helmet.
His opinion will probably be accepted.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
"If you have time tomorrow, come and see me."
Ask anyone.
He bowed to his teacher.
Does that include everything?
I went for a walk in the park.
I want my mother to get well soon.
I think that this tie will go great with that shirt.
Would you like to have some tea?
Tom got nervous.
I'm looking for a bank. Is there one near here?
I'm starving.
It wasn't very cold yesterday.
Will you help me with my French homework?
Tom said that he doesn't know how to speak French.
I scored only 33 points on the test.
Have you ever been to that restaurant?
The bag was so heavy that I couldn't carry it by myself.
Put down your gun.
I wish I could swim.
I am curious.
Have you ever eaten tomatoes with sugar?
Let me know as soon as anything happens.
Don't lie. Tell the truth.
Tom took his dog out for a walk.
He is in danger of losing his position unless he works harder.
Tom and Mary got married last spring.
"I worked all day, so I'm very tired."
Death is certain to come to everybody.
I'm hungry!
Was that before or after I was born?
I don't feel any pain.
Could I borrow your car?
Tell me how to use it.
There were no classes today.
I have not the least interest in detective stories.
I didn't know that song.
Stay home.
Tom is hungry again.
Have you practiced any today?
My whole body hurts.
Dogs have a keen sense of smell.
Tom looked at the photograph.
I laughed in spite of myself.
"Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, is 3,776 meters high."
Tom is lean and tall.
Egypt gets less rain than Japan.
My father neither drinks nor smokes.
She attempted suicide.
Former pop stars are just plain old women by the time they're 40.
Let's not go to that restaurant again.
A time bomb went off in the airport killing thirteen people.
I love swimming.
"If your feet get wet, you'll catch a cold."
Do you understand English?
Have you ever rented a car?
I first met him three years ago.
I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice.
I want to go see a movie.
I'll pay today.
"Surprisingly, there are some people in Japan who keep penguins as pets."
We need to stay alert.
Tom's family moved around quite a lot when he was a kid.
Do you plan to let Tom drive?
Would you like anything to eat?
I have a slight fever.
Tie your shoelaces.
How nice of you!
"Come on, follow me."
He's very stingy.
This is the house I lived in when I was young.
I think Tom had a good reason.
May I open the door?
Tom has been arrested for speeding.
Thank you very much for your letter.
Tom should be at home.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
The police arrested the suspect yesterday.
Tom is reluctant.
Can you make it on time?
I didn't know about that until quite recently.
"He knows no English, not to mention German."
Leave him alone.
Do you have a double room?
Please stick your tongue out.
There's a restaurant I frequent nearby. Let's have lunch there today.
Do you promise not to tell anybody anything?
Have you ever felt dizzy on a plane?
My mother is making sandwiches for lunch.
Is that just a coincidence?
He lives in a large house.
The person in question is now staying in the Unites States.
I have to take the test again.
My uncle bought me this book.
Will it rain tomorrow?
When do you start on your trip?
I have to finish writing this essay by tomorrow.
Go straight down this street and turn right at the third light.
Tom's native language is French.
I built my son a new house.
This tea is too sweet.
It's going to cost at least thirty dollars.
I often get conjunctivitis.
I almost laughed out loud.
I was only a little child then.
It will be cloudy tomorrow.
I felt the same way when I first saw Japan from a plane.
There is no hope of success.
I must leave now.
I forgot to ask your name.
Do you have rice?
He is good at soccer.
The price of rice rose by three percent.
The soup is very salty.
I'm at Tom's house.
We feel the same way as you.
Do you want to kiss me?
I don't have a spare shirt.
I had my wallet stolen.
It would seem that the weather is improving.
This book is too difficult for me to understand.
I wish I were as smart as you are.
Can you tell Tom to stop doing that?
I tried to write down everything he said.
"Is this yours? ""Yes, that's mine."""
I'll go buy some bread.
Why do you say that?
A man is known by his friends.
These pancakes taste good.
I earned a lot of money this month.
I was born in 2013.
I was made to wait for over 30 minutes.
It's time for lunch.
Tom is in a book club.
I had planned to become a doctor.
The story wandered.
I'll shut up now.
The girls sat side by side.
I just want to know.
Did you understand what he said?
Tom seems to have lots of friends.
Is Tom planning to do that today?
Tom won't laugh at that.
Mary and I have been acquainted with each other for many years.
Tom isn't my boyfriend. He's just a friend.
You're optimistic.
"That's not fair, is it?"
I've climbed Mt. Fuji twice.
Is Tom ill?
Tom is three years older than Mary is.
Is Boston bigger than Chicago?
How did the party go?
"Tom is a man, and I'm a woman."
The printer's run out of ink.
Let me pick up the check.
I forgot I had homework.
This museum is a popular tourist attraction.
It's the perfect place for a romantic dinner.
The lion is the king of the beasts.
We adopted an alternative method.
Everyone is unique.
I was disappointed to hear the test results.
"May I join you? ""Why not?"""
He was made to do so.
What does the doctor say?
A fact-finding committee was set up to determine the cause of the incident.
I heard Tom snoring during the class.
Do you often take afternoon naps?
No one knows the future.
I used to eat pizza a lot.
Who do you think I am?
"Thankfully, the medicine quickly started to take effect."
Everybody lies.
"Compared to his brother, he's not so wise."
How would you translate this into French?
Tom got caught.
The door was shut.
The couple next door are fighting again.
The police warned us to keep back.
I love French.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
I was walking to the station then.
You need to work very hard.
"Even if he does something bad, he'll never admit it."
That's what men are like.
Barley is our main product.
Where's my book?
They intended to drill for oil.
I wonder what I should do.
Are you going to cut down all the trees here?
There was nothing left over.
We hardly have time to eat breakfast.
I don't like cheese very much.
Have you ever eaten seaweed?
He came about four o'clock.
I don't want to leave here.
It's our pleasure.
He has an eye for antiques.
I thought both Tom and Mary were over thirty.
I believe that actions are more important than words.
She looked away.
Bring in the laundry when it's dry.
I had a lot of fun last night.
She put her knitting aside and stood up.
It isn't polite to stare at people.
I want this luggage taken to my room at once.
I wonder why the sky is so pretty after a typhoon.
Eggs can be used as weapons.
I don't know anything about him at all.
That can't be true.
I can't make ends meet now.
Playing tennis is a lot of fun.
I see. That's certainly a useful feature.
You ought to have started half an hour ago.
I need to take my suit to the dry cleaners.
It's rude to stare at people.
"He gives us a lot of trouble, but I like him all the same."
Your lips are blue.
Where would be convenient for you?
I need some medicine to kill the pain.
That student is Tom.
Come home at once.
Whose bicycle did you want to borrow?
He likes to swim.
I have the best family in the world!
The desk has three drawers.
I can't solve this problem.
Fish can swim.
I stayed at home last night.
Bear in mind that that school is an integrated junior high and high school.
What are you waiting for?
Do you speak French?
He asked if I liked Chinese food.
It's just like a nightmare.
It was in every newspaper.
How're you doing?
He went abroad two years ago.
Tom came into the room.
Tom is feeling much better.
It's my fault that Tom died.
"I was in Japan for a month on vacation, and it was wonderful."
I decided to study stenography.
Don't be late for the train.
I think it's going to rain.
It's fun to play cards.
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
He found out the secret.
The train was almost an hour behind time.
Tom has never been punctual.
What's your weight?
I'll go look for him.
It rained hard all day today.
Where can I see a football game?
I feel lousy.

I don't feel like studying French today.
Arabic is a very important language.
Your time is up.
I gave him a few books.
We should do away with the death penalty.
You should plan to leave between 6:00 and 7:00.
The moon is out.
I don't write letters.
Tom had a heart tattooed on his arm.
You should really find a hobby.

We're talking about Australia now.
Can we meet at 2:30 on October 20th?
"Tom is visiting Boston, isn't he?"
I suppose you could say that.
Tom's sick.
Tom used to go to Boston a lot.
It's possible.
There's a rumor that Tom got married.
It's in my jacket pocket.
We talked about various things.
Tom is always late to meetings.
Are you good at playing tennis?
Please give me back my book.
Tom promised he'd never be late again.
I just feel like relaxing.
I wish I could've done it myself.
Don't worry about me.
I think that Tom is a Christian.
There you go again.
She answered my letter right away.
"Who could that be? ""I think it's Tom."""
The baby cried himself to sleep.
I don't think that I have time to do that this morning.
Tom shouldn't have done that.
I work for a shipping company.
Don't change your mind.
Would you like something to drink?
I painted this picture.
Is Tom married to Mary?
I usually get up at six.
Let's get a taxi and go home.
I think it'll rain today.
She is happy.
What a revelation!
I met him for the first time.
She decided to take legal advice.
She can't even speak her native language without making mistakes.
"Beautiful day, isn't it?"
I think that Tom is from Australia.
I can't stand this any longer.
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
I just dropped in to say goodbye.
I like to travel.
I don't want to lose my girlfriend.
Tom doesn't like to talk about it.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
That novel isn't for children.
Tom moved to Boston.
Read the kinds of books that you can easily understand.
You're optimistic.
Who's responsible for this mess in the kitchen?
I'm fairly sure I'm right about this.
I want my own desk.
Let's begin at the beginning.
Sweeping the room is my daughter's job.
I have another sister.
There was a good reason for this.
Where's the mirror?
You may as well tell us the truth.
I know that it's difficult.
"Hey, I'm on your side."
Why don't you pull over and take a rest for a while?
Tom was hoping the committee would adopt his proposal.
This is how I usually cook fish.
I am not alone in thinking so.
"Speak slower, please."
I want to eat rice with beans.
Tom had a satisfied smile on his face.
Is there a movie theater near here?
I walked as far as the station.
Tom must know.
I need Tom.
"If you want to buy it, buy it."
Help me stand up.
He is a handsome man.
Is there something that you wanted to tell me?
I've been told what to do.
That is a good idea.
I'm looking for my camera.
Tom is very rich.
A lot of students around the world are studying English.
He is overweight.
"Apparently, Tom kissed Mary."
Your barn door is open.
I've thought about you all day.
Get to bed.
They used to live next door to us.
My aunt brought up five children.

Bring that here.

I have a previous engagement at ten.
Is Tom there?
Why haven't you been showing up to work lately?
Will you have another cup of tea?
What's the key to success?
She has an eye for the beautiful.
It took three weeks for me to get over my cold.
I'll leave it to you.
She has three brothers.
"It's like a scene from a movie, isn't it?"
I'm sure I'll win the tennis match.
I've run out of money.
"How about another piece of pie, Tom?"
He didn't tell me what the matter was.
Are both Tom and Mary still sick?
This book's over a hundred years old.
I can't see anything. The windshield is very dirty.
Why are you talking now?
The candy store has closed.
Do you really want to wear that?
You can't be too good to your parents.
I invited him to my house.
It was not until a few days later that the news arrived.
She's a tough woman.
Did you make a list of things you want to buy?
She is very wise.
My older brother did all the preparation for us.
We all have missed you.
Pace yourself.
They must love you.
"That's not our pet rabbit, unless I'm mistaken."
The engine will stop when you push the button.

Could I have a glass of white wine?
Don't look.

Have some coffee.

I'll remember that.
I have to leave.
How's Tom doing?
He can't resist sweets.
"That's enough, right?"
I'm touched by your concern.

When will we get there?
Tom believes in life after death.
Cut the butternut squash into one-inch cubes.
I'm often told I don't look good in a skirt.

I didn't mean to cry.
I'm also a teacher.
There may be some scars.
Do you have a match?
He will come.
I'd better rewrite this paper.
Tom went into the kitchen to drink some water.
He goes to school by bus.
Do you think that it'll rain tomorrow?

Please don't follow me.
I feel the same.
I shut my eyes again.
I was a baby in those days.
Tom understands French.
Don't run risks.
We'll get off at the last stop.
What do you think about this plan?

It's a quarter till two.
That guy is weird.
Tell me what you did on your holidays.
When are you planning to return?
Mary reached into her handbag and pulled out her checkbook.
Tom came about 2:30.
I'm familiar with the area.
You can't miss it.
The rain's let up.
I don't want to eat this stale bread.
When is your school festival?
I can't remember anything.
We strolled through the park.
Tom's condition worsened.
Good luck.
Why do we have homework?
Do you feel bad?
He is above doing such a thing.
I went to the park with Mary yesterday.
I'd like three of these.
Is there a bread store near here?
You're foolish to say such a thing.
She handles a saw very well.
Help me!
Will you switch seats with me?

He'll come soon.
I hurt my elbow.
I will see to it.
When is your book coming out?
Space travel is no longer a dream.
I beg your pardon?
How did you get into my room?
That house has been sold.
There are sixty seconds in a minute.
Sign your name there.
Where did you have breakfast today?
He abuses his authority.
The dog jumped over the fence into the garden.
I only wanted to know his name.
I did smoke when I was young.
He is scheduled to come up to Tokyo tomorrow.
I don't see anything.

This year is a leap year.
"I never thought it would work, but somehow I managed to pull it off."
The boys are still playing in the sandbox.
Where does it hurt?
I wouldn't dream of letting you do that.

He's crazy about soccer.
All of us were busy cleaning the room.
I came here today with my mom.
I found the missing piece of your necklace.
Were both Tom and Mary born in Boston?
Tom may not come.
"I've made a reservation at an izakaya near Shinjuku Station. It's all you can drink for 2 hours for 2,500 yen."
I think that I'm right.
Our teacher seemed angry.
I'm actually a university teacher.
I'll wait another five minutes.
How long will you have to wait?
Don't kick the door open.
Parents teach their children that it's wrong to lie.
Tom cleaned the bathroom.
Tom works for an Australian company.
The plane arrived exactly at nine.
I'm no longer worried.
How was your trip?
My studies are going okay.
Tom is alone again.
I wrote to inform him of my decision.
I don't believe that Tom can win.
I definitely won't do that again.

The news made her sad.
This is a wooden table.
Please refrain from smoking in this room.
Tom was afraid he might get expelled from school.
Was the train crowded?
Tom doesn't hate you.
She's not a good cook.
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
Could you give me some?
"At first, I couldn't make out what he was saying."
That serves you right.
I'm beginning to remember it.
Cheer up.
Do you want to do it again?
He loves to fish.
Will you do me a favor?
I love learning languages.
You'd better do that now.
He has a slight edge on you.
"She was born in 1946, on August 19, in California."
The train left on time.
I wasn't surprised when Tom showed up at the party because Mary told me he'd be coming.
He stared at me.
This work doesn't pay.
Did you wash the dishes?
Is he right?
Let's go somewhere quiet and talk.
I don't really know if it's a good idea or not.
"If I'd known you were sick, I could've visited you in the hospital."
Tom has gone for a walk.
Tom met Mary on his way to school.
My shoes are too tight.
Will the work be finished by tomorrow?
Tom's been drinking beer.
You can use my desk if you want.
They look alike to me.
May I ask a favor of you?
We use a lot of water.
Take care of yourself.
Who's taking care of your kids?
I can't find my luggage.
Who is it?
I'm very disappointed in you.
I'd be surprised if Tom and Mary got married.
Do you plan to eat all of that yourself?
We have no alternative but to work.
This search engine is terrible.
It looks like Tom is sleeping.
I want to save more money.
I lied to Tom.
I met Mary yesterday.
"I was supposed to be studying, but I watched TV instead."
This street runs due north.
I don't want to lend or borrow.
We helped each other.
What makes you think Tom will win?
Thank you for your backing.
Tom cares a lot about his reputation.
Could you just hurry?
I've never seen a temple this big before.
I can hear a saxophone somewhere.
You can see the whole park from the restaurant.
I have nothing to do with this accident.
May I turn down the TV?
"Whatever happens, just keep smiling."
That's really great!
Tom would say yes.
This is so much fun.
The same thing happened in 2013.
Tom is my friend.
The forest was silent then.
I don't have a rice cooker.
"I noticed a note on my desk, but I don't know who wrote it."
Her weakness is that she talks too much.
The days are getting longer and longer.
How can you make your way in life without a good education?
Is it easy to install?
I totally agree with what you say.
Tom is crazy.
Does Tom eat fish?
How did you go to Boston?
I have an appointment with him at noon.
He robbed me of my purse.
Just take it.
Is it true that you've never had a serious illness?
I think she is over forty years old.
I'm going to wash my hands.
"Now, please don't get so angry."
I think I have chickenpox.

What woke you up?
"Tom is safe for now, isn't he?"
I dream in French.
Are you depressed?
We've decided to get a divorce.
"As soon as Tom heard the news, he burst into tears."
Give me a definite answer.
We need to find a car.
Tom's escaped.
I bumped into him at the station.
"Sometimes I work, and sometimes I play."
We can see the whole city from here.
He began to run.
Squirrels love acorns.
Tom still lives with his parents.
What's in the black box?
I don't want to eat any more.
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
Everyone is happy.
I don't get up as early as you do.
I can walk at least two miles.
When are you free?
I can't see very well.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
Please show me another camera.
You can see a white tower over there.

I'll bring my sister when I come next time.
I'd like to reconfirm my flight.
I'm thinking the same thing.
I feel good this morning.
Tom doesn't have an office.
This door will not open.
Are your eyes bad?
One of you is lying.
I know he is busy.
I might have to go to Australia.
"Pass me the salt, will you?"
I agree with you to some extent.
What's your father do?
He lost his way in the woods.
I didn't need to paint the fence.
She went to a movie the other day.
I hate the rules.
He attributes his success to good luck.
I'm sure that I'll win the tennis match.
That person is a teacher at this school.
"When I got home, my mother and father were quarreling."
I love you.
Tom wanted me to speak French.
He got lost while he was walking in the woods.
I want to talk to him about it.
There were several rooms still vacant.
Tom has no one to talk to.
I don't know what to do.
How many times do I have to tell you to clean your room?
Open the door and let the dog in.
Go wake Tom up.
I'm killing myself to meet the deadline.
The king oppressed his people.
I'm sorry to call you so late at night.

I don't work on weekends.
Did you hear Tom singing?
Tom doesn't live here.
Did you turn the light in the living room off?
"Name and address, please."
Are you talking to yourself again?
"She tried to lift the box, but found it impossible to do."

"If you were in my place, what would you do?"
Do you have any pencils?
Was this added by mistake?

Were you able to solve the problem?

Please cut my hair.
A cold wave hit this district.
The coalition force fired at her car at the checkpoint in Baghdad.

There was a lot of furniture in the room.
I have to paint it.
Tom's eyes were glued to the screen.
He was quite weak in his childhood.
He has his reasons for staying there.

I've got a headache.
We have lost sight of him.
What do you think of this hat?
I don't understand French.

Do you know when Tom will be back?
Don't give me that.
We hang out together all the time.
Soldiers guard the place day and night.

We're working hard to reach our goals.
He owes his success only to good luck.
This flower is very beautiful.
The baby stopped crying.
When did you begin studying English?
It's too smoky here.
You should attend to your own business.
May I sit down?
I sometimes hear rumors about her.
"As far as the teacher was concerned, she was a joy to teach."
I know Tom is a health nut.
It rained for the first time in ten days.
"No matter how close we may be, I can't ask him to do that."
I'm the happiest man on earth.
Thank goodness!
I ache all over.
"Tom, look at me when I'm speaking to you."

"She's really smart, isn't she?"
"Close your eyes, please."
I'll be meeting Tom's parents tonight.
He had no coat on.
Do you like to read?
She was clearly satisfied with the results.
"I've taken medicine, so I'm fine now."
I wonder if there'll be more snow this year than last year.
Tom cut the apple into thin slices.
"Suddenly, it began to rain."
We are brothers.
"Even though it was sunny today, it was quite cold."
Did anyone call you?
The French teacher was stumped by her student's question.
What's on the schedule for today?
Give him my best regards.
He doesn't have the ability to do the work properly.
Thanks a lot.
Finding a replacement will be hard.
He seems rich.
The police came as soon as they heard the gunfire.
There are people who seldom speak unless they're spoken to.
How do you know they're Canadians?
Can I take books out?
I don't remember.
Just when the first human beings will reach Mars remains to be seen.
That doesn't sound too hard.
Tom isn't foolish.
"While reading a book, he fell asleep."
It was snowing that day.
Were you planning to do something special for Tom's birthday?
She bought a new house the other day.
It is difficult for Japanese people to speak English fluently.
My camera is waterproof.
It is necessary to secure financing for local road maintenance.
Tom can't figure out how to get the box open.
Blueberries are now in season.
My wife wanted to adopt a child.
She watched the children going back to school.
I think it's a waste of time to watch TV.
Please put a fragile sticker on this box.
I feel light-headed.
I'm dying for a cold drink.
Who on earth told you that?
Is Tom absent today?
The situation is growing serious.
"Have a seat, Tom."
Tom can't write yet.
I had to wait over three hours.
Come downstairs as soon as possible.
Life is short and time is swift.
Take lots of vitamin C to avoid catching cold.
Have you been to Australia before?
Consult a doctor.
Tom is well aware of what is going on at the office.
His crime deserves the death penalty.
That's my line.
Tom! What are you doing?
She studies hard.
It appears that he's a student.
We drink at least three liters of water a day.
She was very beautiful when she was young.
Tom bikes to school.
She is probably over forty.
I hear from my mother once in a while.
I'm going to visit Australia next summer.
What time are you leaving?
Marble floors are beautiful.
I think this project is going well.
I'm not always home on Sundays.
"It's humid, isn't it?"
Let's order something.
What are you doing now?
I have a favor to ask of you.
I'm reading it now.
A face with too much make up looks strange.
Mary was wearing a beautiful dress.
I felt something touch my foot.
I'll try my hand at cooking.
I'm begging you.
The world is on the verge of destruction.
He bought a Honda.
I stretched out my arms.
Were both Tom and Mary late for class?
When was last time you washed your car?
"French is difficult, don't you think?"
Where is the bus stop?
You're welcome to any book in my library.
Was Tom worried about his grades?
I'm really worried.
It isn't that far.
I want to rent an apartment.
I'm a deeply religious man and believe in life after death.
I hate exercising.
Jump.
Help me dismantle it.
Don't blame the children.
Is it hard to speak English?
"If the phone rings again, I will ignore it."
She cooks for him.
How did you like it?
There are many problems to solve.
Tell me where to put these books.
It's about time we went to bed.
The train is here.
I have something to show you.
Are you still in love with your wife?
My father doesn't like soccer.
I was about to leave for work when the telephone rang.
The supermarket near our house closed last week.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
The rumor is going around that the actress is going to get a divorce.
I fell off the ladder.
Let's grab a quick lunch at that small coffeeshop near the park.
Watch out for thieves around here.
Tom wasn't the one who cleaned the room.
Have you ever pruned a tree?
What do you do?
Can I help?
There's a cherry tree in the garden.
Is there anyone here who can speak Japanese?
I lost my camera.
I'll never ever sing in a karaoke bar.
Let me tell you a story in French.
There is an exception to every rule.
I appreciate you calling me.
I have seen her before.
You would make a good diplomat.
My eyes feel gritty.
Tom is three years younger than Mary is.
Everyone ran outside.
We're students.
Stop bullying Tom.
I can't get in touch with him yet.
Let's not talk about work.
Kendo is a martial art.
I will lend you as much money as you want.
I forgot to call.
Behave yourself.
There's nothing to worry about.
I've got an exam in the morning.
You're not allowed to hunt in national parks.
I'm going to save more money.
"When do you swim? ""I swim in July."""
Today isn't so cold.
"Dinner is ready, so we can eat whenever we want."
"I work on Sundays, too."
"He came back not because he was homesick, but because he was running short of money."
How was your test?
Name three kinds of bread.
Please hold down the fort until we get back.
I want to follow you wherever you're going.
This river runs into Lake Ontario.
You gain nothing by speaking ill of others.
Both Tom and I were tired.
"Unfortunately, that's true."
Somebody has died.
I'm taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
I know that I have to. I just don't want to.
I used the knife to cut the cake.
Take anything you like.
Hello!
Shut that boy up.
"If that were true, what would you do?"
How time flies!
What time do you get up on workdays?
He looked up at the sky.
Tom was obviously a rich man.
I don't have anything to do today.
I was tired today.
This movie is terrible.
"This is a secret, so please don't tell anybody."
Two high school boys beat Tom black and blue.
I'm drinking a beer.
There's no film in this camera.
How old is that boy?
He threw a stone into the pond.
The damage was covered by insurance.
I just have to drop off this book.
"I am a teacher, too."
Parents love their children.
This isn't my home.
Can you explain why you were late?
Is he at home?
I have to return this book to the library tomorrow.
Do you buy greeting cards online?
What kind of surgery do you need?
Tomorrow I'll harvest grapes.
It is an exciting time of the year.
Japan is not rich in natural resources.
She stirred her tea with a little gold spoon.
Does Tom go to church?
Guess who I met today.
I love my daughter.
Carry on with your work.
I had a flu shot.
Maybe I'm a genius.
Tom himself was ecstatic.
I'd rather stay at home.
Is it too early?
The kindergarten children were walking hand in hand in the park.
He died the next day.
I think Tom needs to go there.
It looks like a nice place to live.
I want to be more independent.
Mary wants to become a teacher.
That's why I was late.
Can you help me translate that into French?
Tom learned French.
How many colors are there?
You should try to get along with your neighbors.
Were you with anyone?
What's Tom's girlfriend's name?
Tom and Mary were making prank phone calls.
Tom vanished.
"I met her at the station, but I did not recognize her in uniform."
Thanks for listening.
Tom denied the rumor.
His new film is disappointing.
He had no house to live in.
Do you enjoy studying?
Tom did something stupid.
Tom is having trouble coping with the fact that his son committed suicide.
"Is she coming, too? ""I hope so."""
I'm sorry for calling so late.
I won't tell anyone what you did.
We're looking forward to the holidays.
I didn't decorate it.
We don't have any money to spare.
I found an empty box.
It is no use getting angry at him.
The children exchanged presents at the Christmas party.
How many kids do you want?
Father has given up smoking for his health.
Is this store open on Sundays?
"Tom is your husband's middle name, isn't it?"
Who invented karaoke?
I don't want to run such a risk.
This shop is a rental video shop.
"Eventually, I want to start my own company."
I like teaching French.
I have nothing to open the can with.
Tom is too old for me.
Tom isn't very masculine.
Please don't forget to put the letter into the mailbox.
Where will the bus pick us up?
The police thoroughly searched the house.
Either way is fine.
She's not a full-time employee of this company.
Are you drinking green tea?
We may as well wait.
What do you want to drink?
I can't find my ticket. I must've lost it.
Most people know sea water isn't drinkable.
Tom is a bed-wetter.
"Money takes a long time to earn, but you can spend it in no time."
I'm happy to be with you.
We were satisfied with the delicious food.
Please sign your name on the contract.
He got his shirt mended by his wife.
You should be more thoughtful of your safety.
It's very unlikely.
The whole country was excited by the news.
Mary is Tom's ex-wife.
That’s an even better deal.
Tom ran a hot bath.
How many onions did you put in the stew?
I'm not a good person.
My father is going to go abroad next week.
The mail arrives before noon.
He is well read in English literature.
How do you assess your students?
She gave me a kiss suddenly.
"In those days, few people went to college."
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
Where will you visit?
I think you're on the right track.
You look good in those clothes.
Wow!
Try it one more time.
The baby was sound asleep.
Is it safe to eat a pig's eyeball?
All of them speak French.
I like reading books.
The only place Tom has ever wanted to live is Boston.
This water is safe to drink.
It's good. You should try it.
Don't tell strangers your name.
Leave it to me.
I've lost a bit of weight.
I want to be a good player like you.
I'm not that young.
I had a healthy breakfast.
"Sooner or later, we'll know the truth."
Tom has nothing to be scared of.
I have no fever.
I felt my heart beating rapidly.
Tell Tom the reason you can't go.
She remarried when she was in her mid-forties.
I like watching TV.
Guess what he told me.
"Shall I heat this up? ""No thank you, it's fine."""
Someday I'll run like the wind.
Since my husband became sick he's lost as much as 20 kilograms and his pants are now baggy.
The fire alarm rang.
Six months later we were married.
I'm a man who can't stand being alone.
It's dinnertime.
It is said that golf is very popular in Japan.
"Tom, Mary and John are playing cards in the living room."
Tom picked up his glass of water and took a sip.
When are you planning to come back?
I came here to go kayaking.
I often spend my free time listening to music.
I prefer winter to summer.
I'll pay the bill.
She has gone out.
"I, for one, am for the plan."
I'm still not sure if I should go by car or take a train.
What should I do to find a suitable job for myself?
He is a man of wit.
"As soon as Tom got out of the bath, he ate dinner."
Tom went to a nearby restaurant for lunch.
My father doesn't let me go to the movies alone.
It seems that the rainy season is finally over.
I was afraid of getting lost in the dark.
My parents will jump all over me.
I just finished my homework.
What were we talking about?
Thank you for doing the laundry for me.
Tom told me that he didn't have a passport.
Their intimacy grew with the years.
"You could be right, I suppose."
Why did Tom need to go?
Who wants meatballs?
Have you got a match?
Why are you so kind to me?
Tom doesn't like to stay at home.
I rescheduled.
He said that he was hungry.
It's a piece of cake.
This feels great!
Maybe you should wait.
"I can read German, but I can't speak it."
Don't climb on the wall.
I'm a bit worried.
"I was going to call Tom, but thought better of it."
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
They say that he knows the secret.
I'm better at writing French than speaking it.
He is sure to come.
The box is covered with a large sheet of paper.
Please turn on the light.
Come quick!
My hobby is collecting stamps.
I won't say anything more.
Tom has a smart dog.
I don't like music.
That's not what I'm saying.
What time do you get up on schooldays?
Tom said that he wasn't interested.
I lost face.
Make yourselves comfortable.
An old man was resting in the shade of the tree.
Where are you?
I often do things that my doctor tells me not to.
Come over and help out.
It frosted last night.
Petroleum has been important since ancient times.
I want something good to eat.
Spring is finally here.
My pants don't have pockets.
I didn't ask anything.
I'm anemic.
Let me stay here a bit longer.
What does this word mean?
What is the price?
She was taken to hospital unconscious.
Let me explain it with a diagram.
"When I was a kid, I was very chubby."
What did Tom say next?
"Tom bought a pair of cheap shoes, but they didn't last very long."
Tom jumped.
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
I hate spring.
I didn't think anyone could fix this watch.
We have all kinds of time.
A square has four sides.
Put down your name and address.
It's still raining.
Tom was as nervous as Mary.
Don't let Tom get away.
Do you know how much it would cost to do that?
I have nothing to do with it.
Tom's and Mary's parents are friends.
My town is surrounded by tall mountains.
It's all the rage.
I don't feel like going out.
I don't know either girl.
They are a good couple.
Tom's mother got remarried soon after his father's death.
A cafeteria is a self-service style restaurant.
I'm all alone in a foreign country.
You've got to be kidding me.
"I'm Japanese, the boy answered."
I need to charge my cell phone.
She earns a living by selling her paintings.
We're not sure we can come tonight.
I have very few books in English.
We'll purchase a new car next week.
It's not healthy for you.
Was Tom surprised?
His dream came true.
"She lay awake for a long time, thinking of her future."
The man admitted having broken into the house.
"When she entered the kitchen, no one was there."
I generally walk to school.
It's impossible to go out now.
Let's discuss this tomorrow.
"She was very patient, wasn't she?"
I'm an adult now as well.
Tom eats nothing but fruit.
I decided to become a doctor.
Quit gambling.
Give me your money.
He was innocent.
We overslept.
What does he want to do?
He turned a somersault.
Maybe we should wear gloves.
I addressed the envelope containing the invitation.
What's the date today?
I think Tom is thirty.
I put in an appearance.
I attended the meeting though my father told me not to.
Are you going to eat that bread?
I saw two men struggling for the knife.
Is there an information counter?
Aren't you frightened?
I work during the day.
Is this my responsibility?
I need to send a fax.
See the example given above.
Tom was the black sheep of the family.
Did you leave the door open last night?
Do you let your children drink coffee?
Tom didn't have the courage to pull the trigger.
Ants have six legs.
I can't believe Tom did that to Mary.
Are you angry at what I said?
My seat is near the door.
I can't hear anything. I'm deaf.
He ruined his health by working too much.
Keep on smiling.
"You're going to Boston next week, right?"
We have to do it again tomorrow.
How's your project coming along?
"He can't tell a cherry tree from a plum tree, but he can name them in twelve languages."
Remember to shut the windows.
I pulled the trigger again and again.
I'll be glad to come.
I heard that one way to stay healthy is to avoid eating any food with unpronounceable ingredients.
Come and see me on Sunday next week.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
"However hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can."
Got it!
I'm disappointed my friends aren't here.
The teacher wrote French words on the blackboard.
I want to buy ski boots.
The prosecutor asked me a leading question.
This is a private road.
Please come again.
Have you ever watched sumo wrestling?
Buses come every ten minutes.
My heart was filled with sorrow.
You can't stay here.
"Since I had a cold, I didn't go to school."
He is a person who never cuts corners.
I can't imagine anybody would be surprised if Tom and Mary got married.
How high is that mountain?
"Even though he was a child, he worked hard to help his mother."
He is older than she is by three years.
What makes you think so?
I know a shortcut. Follow me.
May I take your picture?
"Whenever I hear that song, I think of my younger days."
The tail of a fox is longer than that of a rabbit.
Do you know how to use a computer?
It's about time you got married.
We climbed to the top.
What does that mean?
How many people are on board?
Watch how I do it.
I'll call you within a week.
Please help me cut up vegetables for the salad.
Have you had breakfast yet?
My uncle died of lung cancer.
He is fond of playing tennis.
You can call me any time.
The policeman told me that the last bus leaves at ten.
Tom's hands are small.
I have the impression that I already know you.
We didn't need to hurry.
He knows the secret.
Seriously?
My whole body was one big bruise after the rugby game.
My father has gone out to buy postcards.
The train stopped because of the storm.
Come and dance with me.
She choked him.
I slowly slid down the muddy slope.
Did you work yesterday?
I can't understand what he is trying to say.
It's just after three o'clock.
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
I didn't know Tom smoked.
Tom was the last to finish eating.
Why weren't you in class?
Is swimming allowed in this lake?
It's always cheaper in the end to buy the best.
I guess that we're out of luck.
Fire is dangerous.
It's an honor to meet you.
That kid looks sleepy.
We walked about three kilometers.
We'll visit you.
I bought the very last one.
I'm 18 years old.
When will you come back from Boston?
You should do it by yourself.
Don't eat my potato chips.
I'll call again later.
Call me if you need assistance.
He seemed disappointed with the results.
Tom can speak French almost as well as he can speak Spanish.
Do you know how to play the trumpet?
He is said to be a good doctor.
You didn't need to come so early.
I've heard that story before.
"A study reports that 53,000 Americans die each year as a result of secondhand smoke."
I'll walk you out.
I don't want to become like those people.
Tom doesn't even know how to boil water.
I like spending time with Tom.
The fruit is similar to an orange in shape and to a pineapple in taste.
You have to use this key or the door won't open.
Tom and Mary will get married next month.
I just meant it as a joke.
I locked the front door.
Are you having a good time?
This is not Disneyland.
"May I have a road map, please?"
I won't assist you.
Please remain seated for a few minutes.
What did you do this morning?
Tom sang and Mary accompanied him on the piano.
Can I try doing it again?
He was born in Ohio.
What should I do in case of fire?
Mary was arrested for shoplifting.
I appreciate you calling me.
No one ever knew the true story except the three of us.
They filled their bags with walnuts.
It's only two miles to town.
Tom is telling the truth.
"He seldom, if ever, laughs."
I like the color orange.
It rained yesterday.
I worked in a post office during the summer vacation.
Tom got angry.
The stream flows into the pond.
Baby animals are cute.
She is my classmate.
Last night I saw a very interesting movie about World War II.
Let's stop at the next service station.
"You don't have to apologize, Tom."
"He is studying English, but he is also studying German."
"OK, let's go."
Let's meet again in October.
The President of the U.S. is chosen in a national election.
She was feeling kind of tired.
I wasn't able to buy what I wanted.
I'll leave the day after tomorrow.
It's time to be going.
I didn't think that you were going to have the chance to meet Tom.
Tom is taking a bath now.
I object to my son studying abroad.
She couldn't look him in the face.
You won't believe what happened.
It is less muggy today than it was yesterday.
I fear for the future of mankind.
You shouldn't break promises.
Do you really want to go there?
Tom ran for his life.
There is a big park near my school.
You're absolutely right.
I doubt whether he will win both races.
I wish I earned more money.
That's a pheasant.
There are a lot of hot springs in Japan.
I always take a bath in the morning.
I'm dizzy.
"What time is it? ""It's 3:20."""
I don't see anything.
I don't remember getting paid for the work.
May I use your phone?
Put your gun down.
You should thank him.
"When the war began, Tom was a little kid."
Were you going to the railway station when I saw you?
We have to finish everything before Monday morning.
"Tom is rich, but he's not happy."
Do you know the truth?
I'm not kidding.
I fainted.
He is good at driving.
My head is spinning.
Are you implying something?
What's the spelling of your family name?
It was nice and cool there.
He looks young.
She can skate.
I'm acquainted with the chairman of the committee.
Tom told me that he wasn't injured.
They usually go to school by bicycle.
French isn't easy for us.
Are the fires still burning?
I don't like being late.
It's a very relaxing place.
The car Tom bought is blue.
The conference is to be held in Tokyo.
The fog closed in.
I'm sure of winning the championship.
I never liked biology.
"Day after day, the dog sat waiting for his master in front of the station."
All the lights went out.
My brother is now in Australia.
I like both of them.
I thought I'd do that by myself.
Tom told me where to buy what I needed.
I found the book very interesting.
His decision to retire surprised all of us.
Have you decided where we're having lunch?
It doesn't seem convenient.
You'll miss the train if you don't hurry.
"Take it to a mechanic, and get it fixed."
"If you do something that stupid, you'll be laughed at."
Is Tom back yet?
No sooner has one typhoon passed than the next one approaches.
Swimming isn't allowed in this river.
I'll show my album to you.
Tomorrow we will receive our report cards.
Can I use your phone?
"At first, it is difficult."
Tom comes here every three days.
"I have a headache, so I'd like to take the day off today."
The city wants to extend the road.
This gun is out of bullets.
I get how you feel.
The font is too small.
They have access to the library.
I bought a pair of shoes.
"Large fries, please."
Would you like a little more salad?
"Sorry, I've gone and jumped to conclusions again."
I wonder whether Tom really was at school today.
I'm not as stubborn as Tom.
There's too much furniture in this room.
Tom is probably already in Boston.
Can you translate that into French?
I'll ask tomorrow.
Tom spilled coffee on his shirt.
It smells like something is burning.
They are both very excited.
The result was disappointing.
We finally published the book.
I can't tolerate lying.
He looked quite handsome in his suit and tie.
I can't work at all with all these useless calls coming in.
Icicles hung from the roof.
Are you planning on buying a new computer?
This string is strong.
Tom didn't stay very long.
I have little interest in history.
This bottle is empty.
This book is interesting no matter how many times I read it.
I thought this might come in handy.
Are you about done?
Tom didn't know that Mary was in the hospital.
"How old are you now, Tom?"
Tom put the vacuum cleaner into the closet.
Thank you for your time today.
"Do you have a hobby, Tom?"
Lock the safe.
This works.
He was promoted to section chief.
Are all swans white?
She is always dressed in black.
There's no point in going to a place like that.
I'll admit I'm wrong.
Is he busy?
My whole body hurt.
They paid no attention to their safety.
The moon doesn't have an atmosphere.
"What's important isn't how many books you read, but what books you read."
"Could I have the bill, please?"
Don't worry about that.
He sang and sang.
I knew that Tom could do that.
The train was due at 6.
A cup of hot soup relaxed me.
Tom follows Mary on Twitter.
Tom isn't a bad person.
How do you like this parka?
I just finished breakfast.
He lost face.
"You can't go out now. ""Why not?"""
She's in the garden planting roses.
We usually have breakfast at 7:30.
He must love you.
Thank you for your help.
The police are convinced Tom didn't die from natural causes.
Tom knows what Mary said.
Tom lives in a fantasy world.
Tom doesn't go out much.
He's probably sleeping.
The post office is just across from that store over there.
I'd like to change some money.
I only stated the obvious.
You don't need to go there if you don't want to.
How long should we leave it in the oven?
Tom has already eaten.
Can I have a bite?
I want to watch that movie again.
"When I was a college student, I always pulled all-nighters before tests."
She raised her voice.
"Tom, I've got a surprise for you."
It isn't my fault.
Here is your dog.
Why did I buy flowers? Why are you asking me such a question? I just bought them because I wanted to.
Your hair's beautiful.
How much money do you have with you?
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Can you explain the exact meaning of this word?
I want to learn more about this.
Please throw the ball.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
Do you get up at six?
"In two days, I'll turn 13."
"He was tired, but he kept working."
I saw that girl the other day.
Tom hired Mary as an interpreter.
Be careful.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Don't worry. Everything's under control.
I had my hair cut.
Tom loves Mary's children.
The terrible scene made Tom shudder.
The king ordered that the prisoner should be set free.
I'm getting hungry.
Do you want to look into it?
He has a bicycle.
Does Tom still have your key?
It is me that painted this picture.
Would you like some more cake?
I'm awake.
I just finished doing it.
I don't have a ticket yet.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
I'm not asking you to change your opinion.
The trip was expensive.
My hands are tied right now.
The hunter followed the bear's tracks.
Nothing is more important than time.
I hope that your dreams come true.
Many children were playing in the park.
I have more questions for you.
I can do it in a week.
I planted this tree three years ago.
I said shut up!
"I, too, would like to know."
"In case of emergency, call the police."
Could you please close the window?
I live near here.
"You don't have any proof, do you?"
You're not so special.
One of the tires was flat.

I'm looking forward to seeing your father.
I don't know which to choose.
Where am I on this map?
I have a lot of work to do.
I don't like going to school.
Smoking in the restaurant was forbidden.
Where does it hurt?
Express yourself as clearly as you can.
Do I look that stupid?
Tom said he'd buy a truck.
I'd like to take a break.
We're all praying for Japan.
Where is the backstage entrance?
She has a strong dislike of insects.
Whose are these?
You must go through with your plan.
I thought that we were going to win.
Is this seat free?
"I can read English, but I can't speak it."
Do you know how to use this machine?
I told Tom we'd be late.
You may not pass the test.
"First it thundered, and then it started to rain."
Butterflies live for three days.
I have to do a lot of things.
Tom couldn't help but laugh.
I spent last Sunday reading novels.
I was glad I was there.
You ought to have told me that before.
"Who is it? ""It's me."""
Mary always brings the rain with her.
I'll reconsider the matter.
What were you going to do?
I'm disappointed my friends aren't here.
He's so moody I have trouble keeping up with him.
The trash can is empty.
"I've heard a lot about that, too."
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.
Today is Friday.
I prefer tea with no sugar.
Please have a second helping.
Who isn't here?
What are you looking for here?
Would it be OK to parked my car here?
What is that big new building?
I left my umbrella on the train.
Relationships are incredibly complicated.
Tom is obviously very good with his hands.
I take my hat off to her for her effort.
I was also there.
She was watching the dead leaves fall.
Did you wash yourself?
It was a lot of fun.
I need a cigarette.
I know you like coffee.
Only you answered the question.
My car is at your disposal.
Do you want me to open the window?
I can't do without this dictionary.
The mayor's office is in the city hall.
Why don't we drive out to the country for a change of pace?
How long have you been with this company?
Do you remember when Tom said he did that?
"Mom, thanks for everything."
"Sooner or later, his luck will run out."
I love the sound of wind chimes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like you to listen to my opinion."
Time passes quickly when we're doing something we like.
Try again.
I'm fat.
I think that's correct.
Tom is shy.
Wait here till I come back.
I'm afraid to drink it.
"I bought a white, pleated skirt."
He found my bike.
Have you already made a reservation?
I want to sleep.
Tom planted three apple trees in his yard.
I'd like some water to drink.
Tom didn't look very comfortable.
I have almost no appetite.
Please come before 2:30.
"On the tenth of next month, they'll have been married for twenty years."
"Tom has some food allergies, so he has to be careful about what he eats."
I read about how to make beef stroganoff in a recipe book.
Tom opened the window to get some fresh air.
Awesome!
There's something in here.
"Many things are easy to talk about, but difficult to actually carry out."
I've been wanting to ask you something.
I'm starving.
How did you come by such a job?
There's no sign of infection.
Tom didn't have a chance to visit Mary when he was in Boston.
You can't buy happiness.
He said his father was an architect and that he wanted to be one too.
He does not play baseball.
That mountain is an active volcano.
I didn't take many pictures.
Can I see you for a minute?
I bought this umbrella three years ago.
Can I use a credit card?
Try it once again.
My sister showed me her new watch.
Is it dirty?
Tom's telephone is ringing.
Should we call an ambulance?
She must've been beautiful when she was young.
You'll be a good player soon.
I should've stayed home.
I'm sure that Tom will be here tomorrow.
Where did you hear that?
Don't interfere in my affairs.
Why are you singing here?
I agree with you.
I'm dying to meet you.
What do you say we go watch a movie?
I'd like you to tell me the truth.
Would you mind speaking more slowly?
He is determined to go to England.
"Shut up, he whispered."
I'm cold. May I close the window?
He studies contemporary literature.
Please give me a cup of coffee.
I was caught in traffic.
He lives alone.
Here is where I spent my childhood.
I'm going to make you happy.
I thought you were going to be at home last night.
Why did you need a knife?
Tom loved his father very much.
See that dinner is ready by ten.
The situation became worse by the minute.
Tom called me fat.
I'm getting a new house built.
Tom read a story to Mary.
Where are you going today?
Hand in your papers.
She sat next to him.
He had no hat on.
"That hurts, so stop it."
I want your opinion.
What we should do next is the question.
When are you busy?
Tom is a very sensitive person.
We had a good crop this year.
Tom often skips class.
I caught a cold. That is why I could not attend the meeting yesterday.
It is hardly raining.
They're here.
I've dreamed of this day.
My mother took me to the park.
Where are we going next?
Were you at the concert?
I didn't want Tom to go.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand the whole way.
Tom is asleep on the sofa.
Tom is very different.
I like trains better than buses.
They sell fish and meat.
Tom likes mature women.
Please think about the problem.
She found the money gone.
Please knock before you come in.
Do you understand the concept?
I'm glad I was able to help you last week.
They went into the woods for a picnic.
He would not take the money.
I can't carry all that baggage.
How much did you pay for this?
Can I take a day off?
I missed lunch today.
"As usual, the physics teacher was late for class."
He served as chairman for three years.
My neck is a bit sore.
Is there a train station near here?
I would rather stay at home.
He is able to speak ten languages.
Is Tom going to Boston?
Are you a student?
She cannot have told a lie.
It's about time we went back.
Tom made Mary wash his car.
Please don't get me wrong.
I thought you didn't know about that.
I love this photo.
I was waiting for that question.
Is this the right train for Tokyo?
They began to walk after a while.
I think what Tom said was a lie.
Is Tom doing well?
I'm glad that you've returned safely.
The fridge is bursting with food.
I'm eating dinner now.
I made the soup.
I'm really glad I came here.
He made a sharp turn to the left.
Where's the locker room?
Does Tom play chess?
An old man suddenly started talking to me.
Tom's French is already pretty good.
I'm not very good at drawing.
He is a man of considerable means.
Can you please pass me the newspaper?
I found out that the woman I thought was a nurse was actually a doctor.
His kindness touched my heart.
Give me another minute.
I didn't catch any fish.
Will we be safe here?
There was only one warden on duty when the riot started.
"He reached out his hand for the knife, but it was too far away."
"As had been expected, the weather turned out to be very fine."
My brain is frazzled.
Tom dashed to his room.
What kind of movie is it?
Can I cancel this ticket?
I want to know the reasons.
Is it true that Mary sold her wedding dress to Alice?
That's a nice outfit.
She succeeded in drawing the truth from him.
I didn't tell Tom Mary's secret.
I actually like broccoli.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
Tom's face lit up with joy.
This is mine.
Watch out for him. That guy can really hold a grudge.
I bet it'll rain tomorrow.
Everybody makes mistakes.
The meeting begins at three.
I didn't expect you so soon.
My heart hurts.
Tom can see ghosts.
I was very angry with myself for my lack of courage.
It fell to pieces.
"Tom, I don't feel comfortable letting Mary go by herself, so please go with her."
Where did I put the paper?
She baked me a cake.
I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left.
Don't shoot!
I don't blame you.
We've arrived.
What other days do you have available?
Do you require a security deposit?
I don't know how much it's going to cost.
Yesterday I went to the park.
I wonder if Tom will come tomorrow.
The whale is a very large mammal that lives in the sea.
Tom is yearning to live in the country.
I don't want to wait any longer.
How much is the bus fare?
I regularly go to bed at nine.
All our family heirlooms were destroyed in a fire.
Do you prefer green tea or black tea?
Wait just a second.
There's no doubt about it.
What time is it there now?
You should apologize.
Do you want to eat out today?
Admission is free.
I managed to get in.
You have to believe in yourselves.
Lemons are sour.
The TV remote control is under the couch.
Excuse me. May I use your bathroom?
Let's return to the hotel.
You're driving too fast.
I'll ring you back.
The door clicked shut.
Tom quit smoking three years ago.
I was very poor in those days.
Boston is the best!
I'd rather go take a walk than go see that movie.
"After spending three weeks looking for a job, he found a well-paid one."
"Oh, have a heart."
I always get up at six.
Tom saw Mary.
Was that Tom's idea?
I think I'll brown bag it this week.
Can the doctor see me this week?
The old man told us about the amusing incident.
I am so tired that I can hardly walk.
My father was hospitalized yesterday.
"Even though Tom is very old, he can still take care of himself."
Will he be coming this evening?
The bad weather caused many accidents.
Please tell me the truth.
Someone stole my watch.
May I ask you a question?
Tom told me he didn't like swimming.
The old man had been making white lightning for 50 years.
Come home before six.
This train is very old.
I'm thirsty.
I sat in the front of the bus.
"Tom was sitting at his desk, drawing a picture."
My father's hobby is fishing.
He's kind to me.
He's lying.
Don't act surprised.
What do you want me to do?
It was one of the best days of my life.
Is this a dream?
"If you don't ask, you'll never know."
I am tired and I want to go to bed.
This lid is too tight for me to open.
Tom got fed up.
It'll be hot tomorrow.
Please give me an envelope.
The car broke down.
What scared Tom the most was the thought that he might not be able to walk again.
I really appreciate it.
She really wants to lose weight.
"The nights are cool, but the days are hot."
I went into the navy.
That's not what I meant to say.
Don't look down on the poor.
It was a very cold day.
Did you see my father?
Tom spent a sleepless night thinking of Mary.
I'm glad to hear that.
Tom found Mary.
How many Chinese characters are there?
Some of the college students who are caught cheating on the exams do not even blush.
I forgot that I met her last month.
Where can we buy what we need?
"Tom doesn't take a walk every morning before breakfast anymore, but he still does several times a week."
Let's go to the beach.
The sky will soon clear up.
"When I got up, it was snowing outside."
I think it's sad not to have any friends.
We hid under the bed.
"Sorry, I'm busy at the moment."
Tom got a small piece of pie.
They remained good friends.
Everybody would like to believe that dreams can come true.
"Give me another pillow, please."
They admire her deeply.
Get it settled once and for all.
Both Tom and Mary are single parents.
Tom and Mary are twins.
Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
Whose bicycle did you say that you wanted to borrow?
Help me with the spring cleaning.
"Be sure to get in touch with me, if there is anything I can do for you."
I practice the piano every day.
Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
Move back a little.
I'd like to have something to munch on with my beer.
It's a joke.
The basket was filled with strawberries.
I'll follow you wherever you go.
It looks painful.
I've met him many times.
She said that she didn't eat meat.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
I really enjoyed myself.
You forgot your umbrella.
Please make yourself at home.
Follow your dreams.
He is a daredevil.
Let's get off here.
This is none of your business.
Isn't it nice?
I have to make a call.
Your driver's license has expired.
"Nobody likes him, because he is always blowing his own horn."

I don't think I can get you to understand how difficult that is.
This room doesn't get a lot of sunlight.
Which tooth hurts?
She bought six yards of cloth for a dress.
I don't like summer.
I improvised.
This isn't funny.
Should I wash the lettuce?
Was Tom absent from school yesterday?
Take as many peaches as you like.
I can't stand this noise anymore.
I get up at 6:30.
"As is often the case with young men, he does not pay much attention to his health."
Tom asked me where I learned to ski.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?

I like to travel by myself.
What's the meaning of this phrase?

Are you alone?
Could you exchange it with a different one?
She is having dinner.
How many books did you read?
This essay is very well written.
This soup tastes awful.
You shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
"We concluded, however that the price of 5,000,000 yen was too high."
I only wear a kimono about once a year.
"Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday."
What time did you go to bed last night?
"I can't find the key, but it should be around here somewhere."
It's a real bargain.
I can't buy it because I have no money.
I think it's wrong to lie.
The teacher pointed out several mistakes in my English composition.
The rainy season has set in.
I want some ice cream.
I have something I need to discuss with Tom.
The waiter put a new tablecloth on the table.
The color is purple rather than pink.
Please feel free to ask questions.
Everyone seems to be having fun.
I may not be able to cope with those problems.
Do I have to write in ink?
Could someone tell me why Tom is angry?
Do you think I should let Tom do that?
"Unfortunately, this house has already been sold."
He reluctantly agreed to my proposal.
Don't be mad.
"Starting next week, I have tests every day."
How do you use these?
Don't try too hard.
I thought Tom would never see you again.
"Sooner or later, he will run out of luck."
I had intended to go there.
It was wise of you to ask him for help.
Where have you been all this while?
She brought a cup of tea to me.
I have many friends I can talk to.
Tom remained silent.
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
I can't see well.
I was caught in a shower and was drenched to the skin.
I'll call you back.
This is exactly what I wanted.

Tom should've apologized to Mary.
I think that his novel is boring.
Tom might not want dinner.
I have promised myself to read more books.

Don't get caught.
"Tom is on the honor roll, isn't he?"
He turned up an hour later.
Did you brush your teeth?
It's just started to rain.
Who are you seeing tomorrow?

Tom hid behind the sofa.
This data is for my thesis.
"When Tom woke up, he found Mary reading a book at the desk."
He has acted wisely.
I'm wondering how long $100 will last me.
Who do you usually have lunch with?
We think that there should be no more wars.
Tom sat on the tatami.
You have to be more careful when you play ball.
Germans love beer and sausages.
The ship was at the mercy of the waves.
I bought this yesterday.
Everybody in the picture is smiling happily.
Search me.
The die is cast.
Come on! I can't wait any more.
I'm getting good at speaking French.
The boy showed off his new bicycle to everyone.
I can't get in touch with him yet.
Tom was kind of cute when he was a kid.
He's a typical workaholic.
This car runs on natural gas.
I'm on my way to the station.
Should I buy this dress?
Do you have any fresh pasta?
I gulped it down.
Swimming is my hobby.
My head is throbbing.
My father used to read me bedtime stories.
I like salami.
I'm proud of you.
That movie was really funny.
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.
How much alcohol do you usually drink?
Mary smiled as she clung to Tom's arm.
One should take care of oneself.
How about eating out with me?
I paid for the purchase in cash.
This window has been broken for a month.
"There is little, if any, hope of his recovery."
She started doing her homework right after dinner.
Why don't you join in the conversation?
Your proposal is a bit extreme.
It's interesting news.
I make it a rule to jog early in the morning.
The book I bought yesterday was expensive.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I went to a concert yesterday with a friend.
I can't hear it.
He was too tired to go any farther.
It was too nice a day to stay inside.
Let's go home.
I'd appreciate it if you'd turn off the lights.
His failure has nothing to do with me.
Did you read this morning's newspaper?
Learning another language means discovering a new world.
What're you doing?
He comes on strong.
"I can't be sure, but I think Tom likes Mary."
I have a cut here.
Are you still living here?
He was unsteady on his feet.
My mother made me a new dress.
"Frankly speaking, it's difficult to understand why you want to go."
How are you feeling?
She didn't like him.
Why doesn't anyone ask questions?
You sound really happy.
The store is also open at night.
Why don't we have dinner together?
Do you drink?
"Recently, the price of crude oil has shot up, and the cost of gasoline is going up."
I'm hungry!
The people in the next room stay up until all hours doing God knows what.
Thank you for the present.
I always wear a watch so I know what time it is.
She never wears pants.
"Oh, I remember now."
She sometimes hesitates before answering.
It was quite thrilling.
There aren't any children here.
I've never been to Paris.
You can rely on Tom.
That man has very long legs.
Tomorrow I'll buy what I need.
I'm trying to find a new job.
"Tom is sitting on the sofa, reading a magazine."
The enemy attacked from the rear.
I can't start up my computer. What am I supposed to do?
It used to be thought that the earth was flat.
I can't afford such an expensive book.
She was a little girl then.
Let's bake cookies.
Are you on Facebook?
Are you really going to sell Tom your motorcycle?
I don't enjoy traveling in large groups.
Tom was the first to be fired.
I have a few errands.
He adjusted the telescope to his sight.
Empty your pockets.
No one told me that he had failed.
I can't believe that's what's really troubling Tom.
I've gone and caught a cold.
My older sister goes jogging every day.
What does a kumquat taste like?
Could you make it cheaper?
I should've gone to bed earlier yesterday.
I guess that Tom was right.
I'm really not up on recent TV shows.
I haven't yet decided.
"Though seriously injured, he managed to get to a telephone."
He is always studying.
He is no ordinary man.
"Tom likes Mary, but Mary likes John."
The sun hasn't risen yet.
Please wait until I've finished my homework.
"I wish I could stand here with you forever, just looking at the sea."
The wind sure is cold.
I don't need money.
There are no children here.
I awoke to find it snowing.
It was getting dark.
We've known each other since we were kids.
I think that Tom is coming to Boston next weekend.
Cows supply us with milk.
His heart filled with sorrow.
"Not knowing what to say, I remained silent."
My father often reads detective novels in his free time.
A lot of people think bats are birds.
What time are you leaving tomorrow?
I spent the whole day cleaning up the room.
This is horrible.
I'm in Boston.
I'm afraid of the dark.
You're patient.
I knew that Tom was studying.
We have a plant in Boston.
Tom loves fishing.
Do you promise that you won't tell anybody?
It's time for breakfast.
Tom has a part-time job.
It's very big.
Will you help me with my French homework?
It's going to take a long time.
Please cover for me at the reception desk for about one hour.
Which floor do you live on?
Are you really planning to sell your motorcycle to Tom?
Come whenever you like.
I'm going home.
He went to the dentist.
Do you see my point?
She was about to go out.
Some of them have committed suicide.
This tea is called green tea.
Are you in much pain?
Is Tom a nice guy?
He was poor and couldn't buy a coat.
This house is by far the best I've seen so far.
"He endeavored to make his wife happy, but in vain."
He got up earlier than usual this morning.
He was surprised to hear a cry from within.
It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog.
She advised him to use a bicycle.
A lot of people are dealing with allergies now.
Solve this problem on your own.
"I haven't met him in person, but I know of him."
Tom is suffering from a cold.
What's her name again?
I'll rent a car.
Something stinks here.
I had intended to become a doctor.
Do you eat meat every day?
Watch out for cars when you cross the street.
Please send this package right away.
That picture was taken last month.
I'm at Tom's.
Give me something to drink.
She intended to become an actress.
Tom asked Mary to babysit John.
Why is this pizza so bad?
When can you let me know the result?
Thanks for the help.
This nation's economy is growing by leaps and bounds.
I don't have the slightest idea what to do.
Can I borrow your scissors?
He kept on telling lies.
I wasn't aware that you were so ill.
Both Tom and Mary should get some sleep.
Don't treat me like a kid.
Tom is a politician.
I wrote a letter yesterday.
We succeeded.
I appreciate your attention to detail.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
I'm worried about Tom.
I'm far from pleased with your behavior.
I had a lovely time.
Do you know how to speak English?
I have a female cat.
Have you ever been abroad?
Who taught Tom how to dance?
I agreed with her suggestion that we meet again five years from then.
I am going to stay here till the day after tomorrow.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
He can't tell right from wrong.
The movie I saw on TV last night was interesting.
Some drugs cause liver damage.
"She looked in her bag for the key of the house, but could not find it."
A lot of bicycles are illegally parked in front of the station.
"You can speak French, can't you?"
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
He committed suicide.
Do it like this.
Have you finished talking?
Why are you speaking to Tom in French?
Tom went to the airport to pick Mary up.
Would you care for a cup of tea?
He advocated abolishing the death penalty.
Let's put up our tent here.
I want to study history.
It looks like a scarecrow.
Your dog is very big.
Tom is a very humble person.
Tom gave Mary a peck on the cheek.
She cooked the dinner herself.
What's your dog's name?
Are you a beginner?
Children catch colds easily.
Do it again!
How did you know that Tom was born in Boston?
I'll wait for Tom here.
How are you?
This work has entered the public domain.
I'll treat you.
"We waited for Tom, but he didn't come."
Can you tell me how to get to Lincoln Center?
These two are similar.
There are many craters on the moon.
"As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away."
"I asked him if you will come with me, but he didn't even answer."
Would you like some sugar?
I have to change into my work clothes.
We went all out to finish the work before dark.
We should help people in need.
I admired Tom.
You guessed right.
Tom giggled again.
I'd like to stay here for a couple of days.
I'm putting on lipstick.
Light is coming through the curtains.
They are both from Australia.
I haven't met him.
There's an elevator over there.
I just wasn't able to solve this problem.
Tom arrived ahead of Mary.
Everyone agreed with my decision.
Tom can't draw as well as I can.
I paid 10 dollars for it.
"If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam."
Wine is made from grapes.
"If you eat too much, you will get fat."
You'd better make a reservation in advance.
Wasabi really brings out the flavor.
"A few days later, Tom found a new job."
"When I grow up, I want to be a train conductor."
They're all innocent children.
This door can only be unlocked from the inside.
You needn't have taken an umbrella with you.
They needed someone they could trust.
I studied for one hour.
I cleared the table.
Wait until 2:30.
Bring me the keys.
Why won't you apologize?
I want to buy some dark glasses.
When did Tom arrive?
Is my French really that bad?
There were a lot of students absent from class today.
The small fork is for the salad and the large fork is for the main dish.
This road will take you to the station.
"Are the drinks free? ""Only for ladies."""
Tom isn't the one who gave me this ticket.
It feels like rain.
Tom is wearing gloves.
Is this some kind of joke?
It's my only hope.
This is not my day.
Do you have a tattoo?
Are you sure you're not hurt?
Was it difficult to do?
Don't eat like a pig.
The TV isn't working well.
I was deceived by him.
He seems to be sick.
"Does Tom speak French, too?"
A boat capsized.
He held up his hands.
They came to love each other.
I don't want my mother to worry.
"Tom, what's wrong? Your face is red."
It is not easy to get rid of bad habits.
Tom stood in line.
Don't click on suspicious links.
I drink milk straight from the carton.
He searched his pockets for the key.
I've got a lot of problems I need to solve.
Why didn't anyone say anything?
How about playing some Chopin?
I have a lot of homework.
There's not a moment to waste.
I should have worn a coat.
Have you read today's paper yet?
Tom doesn't know how rich Mary is.
I have a friend who feeds his dog strawberries.
Dad goes fishing whenever he's free.
Can you call Tom for me?
I have heard nothing from him of late.
This is not a trick.
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
May I kiss you?
I would be happy to do so.
Don't make so much noise.
I saved a seat for Tom.
I need surgery.
Tom broke his new smartphone.
Please clear the way.
Do it the way I told you to.
Could you please repeat it slowly?
It's nothing to get upset about.
That isn't normal.
A stranger asked me how to get to the school.
"How late did you stay up last night? ""I was up until about 2:30."""
Don't forget to take a camera.
We pitched the tent next to the river.
She's wearing a nice hat.
I remember reading this book.
I leave home for the company at seven every morning.
I have ice cream in the freezer.
Please refrain from smoking here.
I wonder why she is so worried.
I really like you.
"Unfortunately, the whole thing fell apart."
Tom told me where Mary lives.
Perhaps Tom is in the backyard.
Tom seems to be enjoying the party.
It would be better not to go out today.
Tom looked up at the night sky.
May I try it on?
I'd like an orange juice.
My younger brother can run about as fast as I can.
Can I leave a message?
My hands are stained with paint.
Our manager is a Canadian.
He gets lost wherever he goes.
You could count to ten when you were two.
Did you have a favorite book when you were a child?
I was disappointed when I heard that you couldn't come.
Lots of famous people come here.
You're my everything.
He is young at heart.
I wish I had treated the girl more kindly.
They're French teachers.
I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.
Any time will do so long as it is after six.
He kissed his daughter on the forehead.
I know that you're a teacher.
How far is it to the station?
It's not always easy to face reality.
Here comes our teacher.
Where did you get that hat?
Tom bought Mary a gift.
No one knows what'll happen tomorrow.
"I should tell Tom, right?"
"Tom is psychic, but Mary isn't."
That's no business of yours.
Will you come with me?
Let's find a solution that is acceptable to everyone.
What's the weather like today?
Is this the right road?
Can I turn the light on?
Tom will be thirty years old on Monday.
I dreamt I was driving drunk.
She kicked him.
I'm in the tenth grade.
Tom has serious problems.
What is over there?
This no longer matters.
I don't do that.
Tom is smart.
It became a habit.
He memorized ten English words a day.
I seem to have the wrong number.
Tom left the TV on all night.
The ship is sailing to the west.
"It cost him 3,000 yen to get a haircut."
We waited for you all day long.
Tom lives across the river.
"It's likely to get cold tonight, so you may need an extra blanket."
I don't like waiting in line.
I made a mistake.
John and Mary have known each other since 1976.
Do you watch a lot of television?
You've got something in your teeth.
Did you climb trees when you were a child?
What for?
I will buy a car.
I don't want to take on any more work.
I wonder if Tom is still upset.
Is it all right if I call you Tom?
I'd like to tell Mary that I love her.
He is beyond hope.
I'm glad to see you again.
Are you wearing a wire?
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Take it easy.
Are you free tomorrow night?
I haven't said goodbye yet.
Tom said that Mary looked drunk.
That's the way.
What time do you usually have breakfast?
Would you like to meet tomorrow?
"I have a fever, so I'll leave early."
I have a small favor to ask of you.
My house is in the northern part of the city.
Tom can't be over thirty. He looks like he's about eighteen.
There's no parking on this street.
Can you meet tonight?
I need to buy a new keyboard.
Tom owns a house with two rooms.
Did you have a good night last night?
Many women could barely spell their names.
Tom failed to persuade Mary.
"It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone."
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.
"Is he right? ""I don't think so."""
Do you think Tom could do that by himself?
It is sad that he has been sick for such a long time.
The plan is well worth trying.
Were you home?
Tom put some salt on his eggs.
You're a liar.
My eyes are watering.
Your guess is entirely off the mark.
Why didn't you shut the door?
You speak so quietly that I can barely hear you.
Do you know how to cook rice well?
I believe he is not guilty of the crime.
Stop fidgeting and sit quietly.
"Even if I had the money, I wouldn't buy that."
The secret leaked out.
Do you know what time it is?
Where did you learn French?
Tom will be dead in a few days.
I'd like to buy a house.
I wish to be a doctor.
"You look tired, so you should go to bed early."
Please look at this.
What are they doing?
It looks as if autumn is really here.
I just want to say how thankful I am for all your help.
Tom was absorbed in his work.
What is that thing?
There wasn't even one book in the room.
She drummed her fingers on the table.
All three of us are students.
"I'm just an amateur when it comes to art, but I really like this painting."
I treated him like my own son.
It'll be safer here.
Should I wake Tom up?
Nothing's as important as peace.
I think either one is fine.
He turned to his friend for help.
What kind of work will you do?
I've done all that I can.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
I am a member of the baseball team.
It smells good!
Today's not my day.
The children made a giant snowman.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
"If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes."
Turn the radio up a bit.
She was busy.
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
The rain turned into snow.
Is it all right if I take pictures?
Swimming is not allowed in this river.
Do you know whose car this is?
What's your type?
Do you play basketball well?
My name and address are on it.
The fire burned down the whole village.
I'd like to graduate next spring.
That has nothing to do with me.
I understand it's going to get hot again.
Have you eaten supper yet?
We put up at an inn at the foot of the mountain.
I don't know.
I'll kill him.
"You said Tom was kind and he certainly is, isn't he?"
Half a loaf is better than none.
My watch is ten minutes slow.
It's nothing serious.
"No matter what they tell me, I still plan to go to Boston on Monday."
There is a key on the desk.
Straighten up.
A fire broke out in my neighborhood last night.
Everybody had a hard time.
He caught a cold.
Let's get back together.
Will you give me something to drink?
My father was lying down while watching TV.
She held her breath.
Nobody knows the truth.
I don't really read newspapers.
The boy remained silent.
"You're pretty good at English, aren't you? ""I'd like to think so."""
He was too tired to go any further.
This factory makes car parts.
I think that would be wise.
She is 35 years old and in the prime of life.
Are you good at speaking French?
How do you feel about his suggestion?
I am pleased to help you if I can.
"Recently, I moved to a new apartment."
"I said to myself, ""I wonder what she means."""
Would you go to the supermarket and get some butter?
I'd like to study French.
Mary's smiling face showed that she was happy.
Do what you want to do.
Nowadays more and more people prefer country life to city life.
Who do you live with?
I want to be quiet after a day's hard work.
I should've listened to what my mother said.
I forgot my sandals.
I would like to go to the concert with you.
This book sells well in Japan.
You should have your head examined.
My parents made me go there.
We chartered a bus.
It's a deal.
Would you wake me up every morning?
"The last time I spoke to Tom, he said he wasn't planning to go to Boston."
Everything comes to those who wait.
Why didn't Tom visit Australia?
Thank you for the coffee.
I keep thirteen cats.
What's that building?
You ought not to call at this time of night.
I don't know whether Tom will tell the truth or not.
Tom and Mary said that they liked swimming.
I haven't seen you in ages.
Tom does all his homework at school.
Please let me try it again.
When do you like to do that?
She's not a child.
Pain shot through his fingers.
Have you ever eaten an insect?
She is particular about what she wears.
I've been told that you're a very competent person.
All you have to do is to cultivate the ability to put yourself in the other fellow's place.
I have some strawberries. Do you want some?
I'm busy with work.
Some of the students like to draw pictures.
You should listen to his advice.
How can you be so optimistic?
Don't be angry with me.
There are three tables in the storeroom.
Night fell.
How's this color?
"What I want isn't tea, but coffee."
"You haven't told Tom what we have planned for next week, have you?"
How old is this wine?
He enjoyed playing baseball.
These shoes are mine.
It's no use bandying words with them.
The flowers are yellow.
We're supposed to take off our shoes at the entrance.
Is that yours?
Your daughter isn't a girl anymore.
"If Tom had gotten Mary's advice, he would've succeeded."
The snow lasted four days.
Traffic was blocked by a landslide.
He has stayed at the hotel for five days.
My daughter is the apple of my eye.
How long are you going to stay in Boston?
Will you keep your promise?
The police arrived a few minutes later.
The watch on the desk is mine.
Do you need much money?
The price of books is getting higher these days.
Why did you skip school?
Tom is my buddy.
Tom always goes for a walk after dinner.
Tom noticed.
I don't know what you want me to do.
I couldn't make him understand it.
He is a gentleman.
I don't want to talk about that.
Would it be OK if I smoked?
I've never seen so many squirrels before.
I don't feel very sleepy.
Do you want to leave it like that?
I'll do so immediately.
Tom used to bake cookies for us.
This is yesterday's paper.
Have you seen my father?
This isn't my fault.
"When I wear a mask, my glasses fog up."
The children were swimming in the nude.
You don't have to worry.
That is sold at hardware stores.
Tom stutters.
There wasn't a single tree in sight.
When do I have to turn in the report?
Please let me sleep.
It's not easy.
I can't carry this suitcase by myself.
I don't worry so much about my resume.
Tom seldom snores.
A priest skillfully drew a picture of a priest on a folding screen.
I went to swim in the river yesterday.
Tom kicked Mary in the stomach.
This sort of work calls for great patience.
Were you drunk last night?
Does anyone speak French here?
Can you let me see it?
The project is progressing as expected.
Does Tom speak French as well?
Have you been waited on?
"Mary is intelligent, isn't she?"
"You know a lot of grammar, don't you?"
"Tom, what's wrong? Your face is bright red."
He wrote the score of the opera.
It is likely to rain soon.
He came here before noon.
It is not in his nature to be hard on other people.
She was at her wit's end.
Do you want me to stay with you?
Can you give me that?
Why are you stopping now?
Tom wants to become a diplomat.
I don't dislike him at all.
Don't tell Tom.
Tom committed suicide.
Was Tom at the party?
I got lost in the forest.
What color is the roof of your house?
I have a runny nose.
That was not an earthquake.
What kind of songs are popular these days?
Excuse me a moment.
"In Japan, we drive on the left side of the road."
I can't do two things at the same time.
Tom passed out because of the heat.
I am hungry because I did not eat lunch.
Read it again.
The storm prevented her from arriving on time.
He accelerated.
I neither smoke nor drink.
That seemed like a stupid idea to me.
I bought her a new car.
Where should I pay?
"Tom did that, right?"
Don't carry too much baggage when you travel.
Are you going to school by bus?
Let's decide together where to go first.
We are two of a kind.
It's not easy to write a love letter.
He departed for London the day before yesterday.
I'll get in touch with you soon.
There's a small problem.
Tom said that his conscience is clear.
You shouldn't go to school.
I'm a prisoner.
Please pass it to the other kids.
Tom has really taught me many things.
It's inexpensive but very nutritious.
"She's your aunt, isn't she?"
Lack of sleep began to tell on me.
Are you married or are you single?
Now he has nothing to live for.
It's raining hard.
I never thought this would happen.
Why haven't you answered?
The train was about to leave when I arrived at the station.
I often use SSH to access my computers remotely.
I've already bought my ticket.
I'm a cartoonist.
Even men sometimes cry.
I was talking to Tom.
"Mary wrote a love letter to Tom, but she didn't send it."
Let's go out on the balcony.
How did it come about?
He was elected president.
This book seems easy to me.
I'll attend.
"How was the test? ""It wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be."""
Were you a friend of Tom's?
She's after a better job.
I usually go to school by bus.
I felt tired from having worked for hours.
Language acquisition requires creativity.
Tom ate all the ice cream.
I put up my umbrella.
You have the same racket as I have.
I'll never tell anyone what you just told me.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I don't want anything to drink.
Fall is the best season for sports.
I've been keeping a diary for three years.
You can count on him.
The police officer asked me what my name was.
A horse is very useful.
I paid him the money.
He canceled his trip.
Our youngest daughter's name is Mary.
Tom goes to an elite university.
Tom translated the letter into French.
Is that a new car?
"In Japan, practically every family has a washing machine."
Tom has asked me to lend him some money.
That's a lie.
Hug me.
Is there an ATM nearby?
I'm up.
This symbol stands for strength and integrity.
This is a rental car.
I am off duty today.
I have no time to read.
We'll discuss this problem later.
May I trouble you for the salt?
I asked Tom a few questions.
Where are all the others?
Was that guy home alone?
I'm concerned about my future.
"I like you, but not in a romantic way."
That isn't a problem anymore.
Thank you all the same.
Have you called him?
Do you really want to quit your job?
He has been ill in bed for four days.
It's a waste of time to stay longer.
He knows you'll never forgive him.
That movie is worth seeing again.
He slipped on the ice.
Your hair is too long.
This is not a game.
"By the way, what do you do?"
Tom was worried that something bad might happen.
We lost sight of the man in the crowd.
We practice soccer every Saturday.
My whole body was sore.
I'm positive that Tom can do that.
Where do you live?
She's working on the problem.
The train was crowded with people.
We open at eight.
The thirty people on board died.
I know that already.
I'll give you a ride.
The doctor didn't allow me to go out.
He has grown up to be a fine gentleman.
She is going to have a baby.
He seems to have told a lie.
I didn't have dinner last night.
I really like peonies.
My pen just ran out of ink.
I enjoyed it.
The food is very good in the dormitory where he lives.
"Tom is too old to do that, isn't he?"
He is a good writer.
The two countries are antagonistic to each other.
Have you turned in your report?
It looks quite different around here than it used to.
"If I were you, I'd buy that one."
"I had planned to become a teacher, but I never did."
We're sophomores.
This is my first time to be here.
Tennis can't be played on days when the wind is strong.
I'll carry this suitcase for you.
It looks good on you.
Is that a cow or a buffalo?
"Can you just shut up, please?"
Am I in the way?
My daughter will get married in June.
Take it easy.
They went on their honeymoon.
Go.
These clothes are dirty and need to be washed.
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.
It's a lovely day.
Was Tom murdered?
I want to contribute more.
There's no one by that name here.
I'm cutting down on sweets.
I like my steak rare.
Nobody knows.
Tom is quite knowledgeable about modern popular music.
I bought these jeans at your store last week.
He loves to fish.
I have neither time nor money for that.
Tom can hardly see anything without his glasses.
The post office is down the street. You can't miss it.
I would like to talk with you again.
How long does it take to get to the zoo by taxi?
He works for his living.
This is insufficient.
Why do you ask?
What a clever dog!
"Somebody, come help me."
I wonder how long this rain will last.
My parents discouraged me from traveling.
Don't forget to let me know when it's time.
Don't let go of the rope till I tell you.
May I use your phone?
They had to stay at home all day.
Land reform caused a great change in the lives of the people.
That store is exceptionally expensive.
I have several reports that need to be written by tomorrow.
Next year my birthday will fall on a Sunday.
Tom says he doesn't have time to take French lessons.
Please stay as long as you want.
There is a fountain in front of the station.
Is it Tom's birthday tomorrow?
I invited her to a movie.
Tom changed his profile picture.
I'll be back by nine.
The question is who'll go there instead of Tom.
Your daughter looks just like your wife.
Is breakfast ready?
Tom is a customer of ours.
Please tell me how to start the engine.
Please call a taxi for this lady.
"Because of yesterday's heavy snow, the ground is very slippery. As soon as I stepped outside, I slipped and fell on my bottom."
Is that Tom's cell phone?
My father always said that heaven helps those who help themselves.
Who do you think she is?
I heard the sound of a ringing bell.
Were you nervous during the job interview?
There is no use crying for help. No one will hear you.
Do you ever study in the library?
What color are your pajamas?
Tom's brother is a lawyer.
Tom isn't the smartest student in the class.
We sang as we walked.
The project is now in progress.
They are all alike.
Which jacket is Tom's?
"Thanks to this book, I learned some interesting facts about this insect."
Was Tom killed?
We have two deliveries every day.
Don't act rashly.
I'm looking for my brother.
May I ask how old you are?
It's not that far.
A bat is no more a bird than a rat is.
She asked me if I agreed with her.
I didn't meet anyone.
We had trouble finding a place to park.
I can't wait.
It was past midnight when we arrived.
This is a fig tree.
I can hardly wait until summer.
"The moment I heard the footsteps, I knew who it was."
Are you nervous?
She fainted when she heard the terrible news.
I hadn't realized the magnitude of the problems.
I went to bed earlier than usual last night.
Tom is a reckless driver.
I have thirteen cats.
I am leaving at four.
I don't want to go alone.
He went to America to study English.
It's boring to stay at home.
I realized that I couldn't win.
My best friend now lives in Australia.
She knows it's up to her.
That blouse fits you well.
I'm taller than you.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
My dream came true.
I saw you driving your new car.
He laid the book on the desk.
Form two lines.
There is no knowing what will happen next.
It isn't easy to find a job these days.
Tom thinks that Mary can do it.
I have my own thoughts on that subject.
I saw him enter the store.
Do you need this?
"Now that she has quit her job, we can't depend on her."
Stay alert.
The chemical formula for water is H₂O.
Wait till six.
You can rely on him.
I hope I pass the exam.
That song was very popular three years ago.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
I had such a wonderful time tonight.
We all die someday.
I had no time to eat.
Were you home all morning?
The park is open to everybody.
She's a blonde-haired girl.
He turned down my offer.
What did she buy at the shop?
Could I have three cinnamon donuts?
I didn't know how to explain that to Tom.
The day before yesterday was Monday.
Why don't you call customer service?
Did you buy anything for him?
"Which do you prefer, spring or autumn?"
"If you open the window, insects will come in."
Tom is able to speak French now.
When is blueberry season?
I like stories that have sad endings.
Her cat had another four kittens.
This adds to the expense.
I'll have to think about it.
He dropped in on a friend.
Tom is looking at the map.
Four is an unlucky number in Japanese.
You must go.
My mother and father were both born in Boston.
I think that maybe I won't be able to make myself understood in English.
I've only had two or three drinks.
Tom's lonely.
"If I'd known the truth, I'd have told you."
"I'd love to marry you, but my family won't let me."
What time on June seventh would be convenient for you?
"If you hurry, you might catch the bus."
What's your native language?
Don't stay around here.
It seems those two are made for each other.
I really enjoyed it.
How did you make this soup?
You have no need to hurry.
How many English words do you know?
A fire broke out the day before yesterday.
I'm working now.
She abandoned her children.
Could I ask another question?
Is that a bear?
I'd like to move to the country.
What did you have for breakfast?
Put this book on top of the others.
Tom told me to wash my hands.
This is a post office and that's a bank.
I have only just arrived.
Thanks for letting me use your pen.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Please let me tell you a little bit about this position.
"In the United States, cars drive on the right side of the road."
Welcome home.
May I wash all my laundry at once?
I'm very busy.
She has a soft and clear voice.
Who made this pie?
He seems happy.
It's like a dream come true.
This is too easy for me.
Would you say you're a morning person?
How do you interpret these sentences?
I'm not one hundred percent wrong.
Friendship lasts longer than memories.
How many prefectures does Japan have?
I'll say no more.
I thought that I told you not to call Tom at school.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I haven't been sick for the past ten years.
The bus has just pulled out.
"Well, let's get down to business."
I asked Tom what he was reading.
I heard him go down the stairs.
Tom should be home.
He acted as my guide.
I kept running.
It's none of your business.
Please send me some pictures.
Tom is a good egg.
Are they open on Sunday?
He is busy with his work.
I'm satisfied with his progress.
Your cake is delicious.
There's no need to rush.
A man like that gets on my nerves.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Show me today's paper.
The boy is over there.
Tom said that he's afraid to do that.
Do whatever you want.
How many hours a day do you watch TV?
I have to get home.
How much money do you have in the bank?
I'm fed up with English.
Let's throw it away.
How much would you pay me to do it?
Tom has a two-room house.
The moon is beautiful.
This briefcase was expensive.
I bought this bag with my credit card.
Who am I talking with?
How do I get to the beach?
We happened to be in Boston at that time.
Summer has arrived at last.
The cloth was dyed bright red.
This isn't a game.
All the desk drawers were empty.
I have a feeling that she will come today.
I want to go horseback riding.
"Tom, your dinner's getting cold. ""Just a minute. I'm coming."""
Is this the book you're looking for?
The school is located within five minutes' walk of the station.
Are you off your rocker?
Open the window and let in some fresh air.
I reached the station at six.
A face appeared at the window.
How many bags of potato chips did you buy?
Nobody was hungry except me.
You seem to have had that car for years.
"From now on, I promise to be punctual."
At times I feel like quitting my job.
They were swimming.
Was the high school you went to big?
Put the car into the garage.
It's time to go to bed.
Don't play poker with Tom.
Experience counts in this job.
I just got my hair done.
Tom is a very kind person.
Pardon me?
Nobody wants to be around Tom.
When did your father come home?
What do you like about Tom?
Tom normally doesn't show his feelings very much.
The hall was filled to capacity.
I gave the cat some milk.
I came to Australia three years ago.
"Tom considered leaving school, but decided against it."
How many times have you been there?
Those roses are very beautiful.
That's pretty normal.
May I ask a few questions?
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
I resign.
I'm feeling stressed.
She is deeply attached to her parents.
He read the book from cover to cover.
This is so cool.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
How long does it take you to get here on foot from your home?
My son is taller than I am.
She answered with a nod.
Is Tom in pain?
What should I do in case of fire?
The fireman soon put the fire out.
Many young women in their 20s plan to go abroad during their summer holidays.
Where did Tom put his bike?
"The couple quarreled, but soon made up."
Do you know the meaning of this word?
The Cold War began after the Second World War.
"If we stop here, we'll be right back where we started!"
I give up.
No one will know.
Did you sleep well last night?
Tom said that Mary was likely to be arrested.
I hate when this happens.
My younger brother is taller than I am.
Tom lives on the outskirts of the city.
I must do my homework.
Your blood pressure is normal.
Tom is allergic to that.
The tree fell down.
I don't like his smart way of talking.
It is located at the foot of Mt. Fuji.
That's what I expected of my daughter.
I wish they would stop fighting.
I'd like to talk to you about what happened at school yesterday.
"Which do you prefer, white wine or red wine?"
Is this jasmine tea?
May I open the box?
Tom usually doesn't eat anything before he goes on stage.
I must get this work finished by next Tuesday.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
I'll have them repair my car.
Let's run to the bus stop.
I'd like to sail around the world.
He introduced me to a pretty girl.
How many books do you read per month?
I don't want to hear you speak.
Life is too short to worry about things like that.
I think Tom is out on the porch.
"What I want now is not money, but time."
This car is black.
Please go to the bank.
He stayed in New York for three weeks.
They have twelve children.
Why don't we bake some cookies?
I promise I'll be there on time.
I'll guide you.
He explained how the accident came about.
The town is accessible by rail.
I can't get her out of my mind.
Camels are often used to travel in the desert.
I couldn't stand my house being torn down.
I still haven't thanked you for the other day. I really appreciate it.
He is worthy to be captain of our team.
Don't look down on others.
Wolves won't usually attack people.
Tom said he didn't have much money.
I want a sculpture.
Was that the first time you rode a horse?
Our family usually has turkey for Thanksgiving.
Hello.
Your barn door is open.
Aren't you going to spend Christmas with Tom?
Please tell me about your trip.
The bus was heading north.
The blue lines on the map represent rivers.
Do you plan to work until 10:00?
I've lost my bag.
Tom always drinks his coffee black and without sugar.
His opinion was not accepted.
My girlfriend and I broke up three months ago.
You can go.
Tom ended up not coming.
She threw a disapproving glance at me.
Tom isn't a doctor.
I know that.
I'd like to go to college.
"He is young, but he is an able man."
He was out of town last week.
Were you aware of this?
I'm sorry for bothering you.
Who's the new teacher?
We need to learn French.
It looks like the weather will be good tomorrow.
"By the age of 25, she had lived in five different countries."
He's always asking silly questions.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Babies often fall down.
Are you telling me you don't remember where you parked your car?
I knew that Tom was from Boston.
I think Tom is pretty good at French.
He asked his friends for help.
Come home.
"Are you done, Tom?"
She stayed there for a moment.
We began on a new project.
When will his new novel be published?
I don't think that it would be wise to argue with Tom.
I got expelled from school.
It's the book you are looking for.
A committee has been set up to investigate the problem.
Were you drunk at the party?
"Lend me your comb for a minute, will you?"
"I'd like to invite you to lunch, if you're not busy."
I held Tom close.
Tom may come back to Boston soon.
Health is more important than anything else.
I saw an alien.
Tom has been doing well at school.
Red is out of fashion.
You can tell Tom what you want.
Careful preparations ensure success.
I can explain it.
When does the train leave?
I'm so happy right now.
My neighbor is nice.
I'm going to wash the dishes.
We lost sight of him.
The noise distracted him from studying.
What keeps you up so late?
She said that she wasn't very happy.
Can you pay me in advance?
Don't put books on the table.
Some kinds of food make us thirsty.
Tom is on the verge of tears.
She put on her sweater.
I want somebody to talk with.
Tom is a dangerous man.
I hope you don't get an upset stomach.
Are you stupid or what?
We'd better hurry then.
This city is hard to live in.
She was always telephoning me.
I am listening to the radio.
Today was such a bad day.
This site is great!
"You must think it's impossible, but could you at least give it a try?"
Tom isn't very good at dancing.
He fell head-long into the river.
You were talking in your sleep last night.
Why do we have to wear underwear?
"I lost the door key, so I can't enter the house."
Where is the post office?
"The check, please."
Really? Are you going to quit?
"This is a secret, so please don't tell anyone."
This table takes up too much space.
Let's wait here until he turns up.
He suggested that I accompany him to the party.
What did you do for Father's day?
Cut it in half.
I only eat kosher food.
There are some cookies under the table.
You don't need to be scared.
I feel old.
This bag is too heavy.
I want to live in Boston.
Tom finally confessed.
I'm waiting for my friend to arrive.
All we need is water.
There are 16 characters named Tom in this novel.
Some of my classmate always make a fool of me.
Sorry to be late.
Tom hasn't seen Mary for over a year.
I got here before you did.
I wonder if you'd mind lending me your car for a couple of days.
How long will you be here?
Whose is this bicycle?
I felt I had to say something.
I hate going to girls' birthday parties. I never know what to get them.
The women are in front of the library.
This door won't lock.
Tom doesn't have any chance of winning.
Not many dogs are this big.
Kids need sleep.
Will you teach me how to play chess?
What a beautiful house!
We discussed the problem at length.
Who is that man?
"I called her, but the line was busy."
There were three men.
This book is too difficult for me.
"After the storm, the sea was calm."
I don't think it's wise to argue with Tom.
Your mom seems nice.
Everybody seems to like it.
Tom said that Mary doesn't like eating at fast food restaurants.
Did you have a good meal at that restaurant?
We've had a lot of rain this month.
Tom got into the truck and drove off.
I can't do that right now.
I enjoyed myself at the party yesterday.
"I can't go to the party, but thank you for inviting me all the same."
He's reading a novel now.
Let me tell you an interesting story.
That's not Tom.
I can't put up with his violence any longer.
Tom is going steady with Mary.
Do I have to study?
Is it OK if I borrow your telephone?
I think it's unlikely that I'll be able to pass my driving test.
How about a snack?
You're free to use this room.
Tom isn't as tall as Mary is.
I need it by tomorrow.
Thank you for coming.
Tom knows that today is Mary's birthday.
Memorize the poem by next week.
Let's get back together.
I'm really tired today.
People are apt to take it for granted that the professor can speak English.
You're early.
She was almost hit by a car.
Will you take me home?
Tom is the same age as I am.
I don't eat bread.
I awoke to find everything had been a dream.
"I'm sorry, but I have to go to the gym."
Everybody knows the news.
The water was hot.
"If you eat this, I'll eat it, too."
"Sorry, I must've dialed the wrong number."
What do you need?
Edison invented the light bulb.
"The months with the most rain are May, June, July and August."
I'm afraid that you have the wrong number.
They work very hard.
Tom works from nine to five.
Please explain it.
The night is still young.
"In my opinion, he is correct."
You shouldn't have come to school if you have a cold.
He left after he had lunch.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
It's a bull.
"Which do you like better, apple cider, or champagne?"
Which of your parents do you think you take after?
Are you saying Tom was right?
How did you get in?
No one noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
You can use my car today.
He came by car.
Does Tom like pears?
You're persistent.
Tom didn't take his shoes off.
They sell that at a hardware store.
I weighed myself on the bathroom scales.
She feels bad today.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Don't you think that's a good combination?
I needed money.
She is really into knitting.
This rope is 200 yen a meter.
Call Tom right away.
You'd better hurry up.
I've always wanted to write a children's book.
It is necessary for you to start at once.
Don't let that happen again!
I'm eating dinner right now.
Can you teach me to play chess?
We were wakened by the whistle of the steam locomotive at dawn.
We look up to Tom as our leader.
That sounds fun.
I live alone in a small apartment.
The criminal didn't let the hostages go.
How heavy is this box?
Here is a letter for you.
How many brothers do you have?
We traveled around the country by car.
What is in the desk?
Can't you discount it a little?
Cold winds blow hard every winter.
Concentrate your attention on this problem.
I like to play the piano.
I understand how you feel.
You shouldn't do such a thing.
"Last year, I traveled abroad with a friend."
Is this seat taken?
I've nothing to give.
"In 1979, Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize."
I'll do as you advise.
Stop humming.
Your socks are inside out.
"You don't understand it, do you?"
You shouldn't have made such a remark even if you had been angry.
My hair is a mess.
I eat only fresh vegetables.
A bright idea came to me.
Didn't that surprise you?
That banana is rotten.
Don't leave the TV on.
We must sit down.
Please allow me to go.
The news spread all over Japan.
Tokyo's air pollution problem is even worse than that of New York.
My father got well again.
I bought it yesterday.
I sensed immediately that something was wrong.
You really seem to dislike spinach.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
"In 1853, the first blue jeans came out."
Do you remember your passport number?
"Excuse me, would you mind passing me the sugar?"
"What were you two talking about? ""Nothing."""
"Since it's important, I'll do it."
That's why I told you not to go by car.
"I had enough time, so I didn't need to hurry."
I felt as if I were dreaming.
I've got bad news.
Dinner's ready.
Tom was stabbed to death.
There's a hole in this sock.
Tom wasn't good at math.
What do you call this bird in English?
I'm going to complain to the manager.
I would never forget that.
Would you please repeat what you said? I didn't quite catch your name.
Tom's house was destroyed by a tsunami.
The boy's name is Tom.
It is wrong to steal money.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
What a funny story!
He has no money.
I'll introduce you to my younger brother.
My father is paying back a huge loan on our home.
I think that I'm really not any good at French.
I'm busy now and can't play with you.
Tom would be so disappointed.
I haven't eaten anything for the last three days.
What are you making?
I want a laptop computer.
This room gets sunshine.
It's already stopped raining.
Reading books is important.
Tom was absent from school all last week.
I know Tom is very busy.
I wish it were true.
I'm very busy these days.
Why don't you tell me?
I watch television every day.
I think this wine is too sweet.
I was dog-tired when I got home last night.
I only hope that the rain holds off for a few hours more.
I can't wait any more.
Is he nice to her?
Tom always eats the same thing.
I am short of money.
You're kidding me.
There used to be no freedom of the press.
My mother gave me a pearl necklace.
Tom lacks courage.
I'm writing a song.
How may I help you today?
He has been sick in bed all week.
Is there anybody in the room?
Tom didn't believe me.
I have a reservation.
Tom can't go with Mary.
I'm dead tired from walking around all day.
He was able to solve the problem.
He took the wrong train by mistake.
It was a waste of time.
I couldn't sleep.
Show us what you bought.
I think Tom is motivated.
You've got a good head on your shoulders.
Don't tell anyone.
The towel wasn't at all useful.
Please make yourself at home.
There are only two prime numbers between 10 and 14.
I don't like being treated like a child.
Does everyone think it was me who stole the money?
She went to the hospital by taxi.
"After Tom dumped Mary, she started seeing John."
Share this with your friends.
May I touch these?
Some of the students were late for school.
What kind of American accent does Tom have?
Please don't open the train doors until the train has stopped.
There's not enough light in that room to do needlework.
"I can make it to my class on time, he thought."
I've always wanted to do it.
It was really cold last night.
What was the name of the hotel? I can't remember.
Work as hard as you can.
The whale is a mammal.
I keep the master copy under lock and key.
Do it when you have time.
I don't want to go out on a limb.
Seven is sometimes considered a lucky number.
Let's postpone dinner.
"I have to lose weight, so I'm going on a diet."
"Hurry up, or you'll be late."
"If you're tired, lie down."
Few people understood his comment.
"Tom is three, and Mary has just turned thirteen."
You're doing very well. Keep it up.
Be kind to old people.
Tom and Mary send each other Christmas cards every year.
Does your room have two windows?
I'm falling in love with you.
Get out of bed.
Mary died while giving birth.
Birds are chirping.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Please give me some water.
Mary showed the letter to me.
All's well that ends well.
"When I wear a mask, my glasses get steamed up."
I hope to visit Boston someday.
Is Tom going to dump Mary?
Raisins are dried grapes.
I want to have this letter registered.
We all live in the same dorm.
The noise set the dog barking.
I learned something new today.
Don't kiss in public.
It'll take a long time to clean this mess up.
You don't have to worry about it.
I think that most young people like rock music.
Get your dirty paws off me.
Tom started talking to himself.
The explosion may have been caused by a gas leak.
This garden is open to the public and it's free.
She turned her face away so he wouldn't see her tears.
Can't you work any faster than that?
Let's have some coffee.
It's fun to build a snowman in winter.
I've been to Australia only once.
You're going to miss the train.
Have you been to Europe before?
Here you are.
I thought that we were supposed to meet Tom at 2:30.
A girl appeared before me.
He shook hands with his friend.
Tom thanked us all.
I'm not stupid. I'm just bad at math.
That was close. We almost got it.
Tom might be here later.
We got lost in the cave.
It'll take at least an hour to get there.
"I think it'll cost you more than 10,000 yen to have this camera fixed."
I thought that both Tom and Mary were over thirty.
That makes me feel better.
What happens when you have an allergic reaction?
I can't stand that man.
I highly recommend it.
Do you know how to drive a car?
Where are my glasses?
I met Tom on my way to school.
I finally gave up smoking.
Tom was walking slowly with his head down.
Thank you for letting me know.
Tom writes very fast.
I don't really enjoy watching golf.
I'll pay for you.
"If there's something that you don't understand, please feel free to contact us at any time."
"The hotel charged me 8,000 yen for the room."
You may give this picture to whoever wants it.
He is eager for success.
He is young at heart.
You should've worked harder.
There are holes in the roof.
I am sure I'll get along with him because we are from the same prefecture.
She married a rich old man.
This belongs to my father.
I can't solve the problem on my own.
This book seemed interesting.
I'm not sure what Tom will do.
"As for me, I have nothing against the plan."
Do you know when he will come?
I've got accustomed to speaking in public.
We aren't vegan.
It is not good to eat between meals.
I wish I could sing as well as Lady Gaga.
I need to go to the toilet.
The party was over at nine.
Speak slowly and clearly.
How's your business doing?
I have a lot more homework than Tom does.
Tom entered the room.
Try it yourself.
Basketball is a team sport.
Japan is famous for her scenic beauty.
I thought you were going to stay at home.
He has an eye for art.
She turned around when she heard his voice.
They were made of rough brown leather.
It was after midnight when we arrived.
"Tom is very forgetful, isn't he?"
I can see a lady and two dogs in the car.
It was bound to happen.
I'll make dinner tonight.
Tom bought a weekly magazine at the station.
I didn't do anything during my vacation.
"Unfortunately, there was no one around."
We read the meter once every two months.
Could you bring me some coffee?
Don't talk to me!
She lived there for many years.
You have too many books on those shelves.
"Exact change, please."
The policeman whistled for the car to stop.
You have no right to say so.
Answer the phone.
I like summer the best.
I don't want to get you into trouble.
This is what I've been looking for.
That's good news.
It's more comfortable outside.
"Can you call a doctor, please?"

I'll be back in an hour.
Tom tried to get the splinter out of Mary's finger.
Spring brings warm weather and beautiful flowers.
I can hardly swim.
Why don't you take your coat off?
The sun is shining brightly.
Stop interfering with Tom.
We were so excited that we couldn't sit still.
It was a complete failure.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
You're sharp.
She appears to have many friends.
I did it with my own two hands.
He doesn't have any strength left.
Olive oil is perishable.
This book is way more interesting than that one.
Tom slowly walked towards Mary.
I asked him what his name was.
I'm not so sure anymore.
I had a bad cold.
I go shopping every other day.
He was just behind me.
Her children have gone to Tokyo and she misses them very much.
"Show me a list of your rates, please."

Why haven't you gone to bed yet?
It's almost time for the cherry blossoms.
He isn't very good at math.
Don't give up!
Wasn't your name on the list?
I have other plans for tomorrow.
I am pleased to help you if I can.
We don't have sugar.
You should take an umbrella with you today.
I’ll be in touch again as soon as I have more detailed information.
I'll have to ask my mom.
I want to be clear about that.
I can't believe that Tom really said no to me.
We went early to make sure we could get seats.
The typhoon struck the Kanto district.
Tom hasn't been on speaking terms with Mary for years.
"Tom, do you have a cell phone?"
Are you still teaching French?
A number of passengers were injured.
I couldn't understand why she frowned at him.
The castle is now in ruins.
I wrote a postcard to Tom.
I'm starving.

"If you want to go to the art museum, take this bus."
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
Hold on a second.
I arrived at 2:30.
Is this a radio?
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
It's rude to point at anyone.
I believe that story.
It's unnecessary.
Set your mind at ease.
Dinner is on me tonight.
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle.
They made me go there.
I steered clear of sensitive topics.
May I put it here?
An up-to-date edition of the encyclopedia will come out next month.
He crossed the street.
I'm glad that I wasn't here.
He applied for admission to the club.
Yesterday it was so cold that I stayed in the house.
I don't care anymore.
Is this a hoax?
He comes back from Sydney today.
What will you have for lunch today?
Where are my gloves?
My mosquito bite itches.
I was enjoying some alone time.
"As I was tired, I went to bed."
Do you need more time?
He's watching TV.
I told you not to talk about Tom.
I didn't get his joke.
She doesn't have any enemies.
Words can't convey my true feelings.
I have a feeling that she'll come today.
Have you eaten?
The old man breathed his last.
I'll return at 6:30.
He needed to rest.
Tom is their leader.
I think that Tom is allergic to cats.
One of my bags is missing.
What time do you go home?
He's sound asleep.
"I'd like to study French, but I don't have the time."
Tom solved the mystery.
I don't have the slightest idea what to do.
He is often taken for a student.
I've lost my filling.
"Our train left at two, arriving there at seven."
Make it short.
Why did Tom do that?
It's hard to imagine a life without pets.
Can we tag along?
Tom kicked the soccer ball.
Did you ask Tom why he didn't do that?
It looks like today's going to be hot as well.
Wow! Are you serious?
"By the age of seven, he had already made his own bow and arrows."
Please remind me to turn in the paper tomorrow.
It seems that the computer was infected by a virus.
I think it may be defective.
Give me back my hat.
I don't know why Tom did it.
I thought that the questions were easy.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight.
I didn't know that Tom was a vegetarian.
Take my umbrella.
I'd like two kilos of apples.

Who taught you how to play the saxophone?
Can I ask a stupid question?
I've given up smoking.
Is that all you want to say?
"That's Tom's car, isn't it?"
The apples Tom sent me were delicious.
I use it.
Is it OK if I use your car today?
How do I get to Gate 5?
Why are these so cheap?
Who else would want to do that?
I'll take the cheapest one.
I don't have money to buy a dictionary.
Tom wants to sit near the window.
We have arrived.
How can I become a billionaire?
Mary is trying on a dress.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
She wrote the book about people she visited.
That's not Tom's fault.
It was not until the next day that they found her.
Take your medicine.
Please stop playing with your hat.
I got a new battery put in my watch yesterday.
We each paid thirty dollars.
I don't want to talk with Tom.
I want you to stay with me.
Have you decided what to do next Monday?
I'm worn out.
Tom is extroverted.
Where's the money exchange counter?
What's your age?
It's been warm the last few days.
Tom and Mary are both quite tall.
Are you serious?
I don't think it's strange at all.
"Peel the apples and cut them in half, cutting out the core."
It is nine. I'm afraid I must be leaving now.
We'll be studying very hard this time next year.
I usually wake up at 6.
I called my girlfriend right away.
I have a hangover today.
I wanted to be loved.
She's beautiful.
They absolutely detest each other.
Have you seen today's paper?
Didn't it occur to you to shut the windows?
Everything's here.
How much is the tour per person?
Those kids know that.
Something must have happened to him on the way.
It's easy to use.
We are a family.
I haven't drunk green tea in a long time.
I want to punch you.
I don't care where Tom is.
We went down the river in a small boat.
There are a lot of frogs in this pond.
Tom dropped the eggs and they all broke.
I know nothing but this.
Baby hedgehogs are adorable.
I told you that was just a joke.
I'm dying of hunger.
My father won't allow it.
The sun is larger than the moon.
Are you awake?
Tom translated the letter into French.
She said goodbye.
I'm glad to help you.
He's very likely to come.
Where is the restroom?
Thank you for your concern.
Was it a good trip?
Tom is sick.
Everybody likes squirrels.
There's an amazing view from the balcony.
"It's not only sports I like, I also like music."
Our school has about one thousand students.
He moved the desk to the right.
Is there something I can help you with?
How about going to see a movie with me?
Tom doesn't have any brothers or sisters.
I write in my diary every day.
"Which is quicker, a taxi or the subway?"
The leaves are turning red.
You shouldn't eat anything cold.
I was almost asleep.
I like to sing.
That room isn't very large.
"Next slide, please."
How about October 20th at 2:30 p.m.?
Tom was leaning against the rail.
I think that Tom is narrow-minded.
The police are suspicious of the old man.
The store opens for business tomorrow.
There's a calendar on the desk.
This book isn't for sale.
He didn't attend the meeting.
All of us want to live as long as possible.
They live next door.
I know how to do that.
I can't remember her name.
Tom complained about the test.
You must go home.
It snowed a bit.
My grandfather on my mother's side passed away ten years ago.
"Tom is still teaching French, isn't he?"
He robbed me of every cent I had.
Have you ever been to Europe?
The people on the island are kind.
Mary took her phone out of her handbag.
Tom is my uncle.
We ran over the budget by two thousand yen.
I twisted my ankle.
My parents caught me smoking.
"When I didn't know how to answer the question, he gave me a hint."
Have you already eaten some cake?
What's your major?
It's more purple than blue.
Who was speaking with Tom?
Call me up whenever you need my help.
Which car is your father's?
She worked hard.
Tell me where it's located.
I do not believe in the existence of God.
Even a child can read this.
Quite a few people couldn't recognize him in that disguise.
Tom is a good cook.
There were at least 100 people present.
I like the gray sweater more than the purple one.
The dance had already started when I got there.
Students usually like club activities better than their classes.

He always takes his time in everything that he does.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight.
I know who's pulling the strings.
My camera is broken.
I like how persimmons taste.
My father always used to say that time was money.
He could not find what I had hidden.
"The novel has sold almost 20,000 copies."
It's as easy as pie.
She's eating an apple.
They've asked me to translate this book into French.
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with him.
I couldn't help but agree.
She lives alone.
This isn't your book. It's mine.
So long.
Let go of Tom.
I like your idea.
You're always doing the same thing.
I can't live without television.
Look! There's a plane taking off.
Nothing really matters.
Be nice to your little sister.
Don't be in such a rush.
Does anyone know Tom's family name?
Is the mouse dead or alive?
Do you know this song?
Are you open on Sunday?
Let's party!
Is something missing?
My attitude towards him changed.

I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
Don't get so carried away.
Give them the $300.
Why are you speaking French to Tom?
Japan is in eastern Asia.
Don't do it again.
Outside advice may be necessary.
I have something to show you.
I can't stand him.
All the children fell asleep before it got dark.
Is it a cat or a dog?
"My mother has a driver's license, but she doesn't drive."
It's dangerous to swim in this river.
He informed me about the changes in the plan.
It'll be my birthday soon.
The room was gloomy and cold.
I was in the mountains.
I've never seen Tom drinking wine.
Cut the chit-chat and get to work.
We've already bought our tickets.
Go home quickly.
"Leave me alone, please."
I prefer to live alone.
Will you tell me where I'm wrong?
She obeys him.
I couldn't stand any longer.
I usually go to the barber once a month.
Tom isn't angry.

See you next week.
Both of Tom's sisters are beautiful.
They say it will rain.

This fruit has an unpleasant smell.
That dress is made of silk.
Tom and Mary have three children.
Are you going to go to that restaurant?
I have a red bike.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
Tom is a friendly person.
We were a perfect couple.
It was well worth the time.
I made a doctor's appointment for two.
When would be convenient for you?
I just wanted you to be happy.
I don't feel like talking with anyone.
My little finger is swollen.
He abandoned his family.
"Do you cook, too?"
I felt I was being spied on.
I don't meet him so often.
You can't go wrong if you read the instructions carefully.
Doctors make the worst patients.
"If you don't like the way I do it, then do it yourself."
Tom is the tallest in the class.
How is your family?
I don't swim every day.
Tom isn't as intelligent as Mary.
It'll rain tomorrow.

I try to avoid arguments.
She is almost as tall as you.
He arrived at the station at five.
Tom is eavesdropping.
"I don't know what they're saying, but I know that they're speaking French."

Don't ever lie to me again.
I don't know who that boy is.
Tom's parents didn't like Mary.
Tom is reading a book in his room.
It's for free.
The audience was very large.
I need to buy more food.
Don't call me so late at night.
Please don't forget to put stamps on the letters that I gave you to mail.
School is a waste of time.
Tom can swim just as well as Mary can.

That's too bad.
That's when I injured my ankle.
I'll do the work tomorrow.

I've decided to jog every morning.
"Easy come, easy go."
Tom went out for a walk as he always does in the afternoon.
He has quite a few records.

Tom drinks a lot of soda.
You keep making the same mistake.

He learned how to swim.
Tom caught a big fish.

It's a good idea.
Don't lose your purse.
"If you would move over, there would be room for everyone."
Tom dried himself with the bath towel.
Life is short.
I started a new blog. I'll do my best to keep it going.
The server was down.
We have to think over the plan.
I wish that I could figure out how to convince Tom to stay.
May I borrow your car?
I may win if I'm lucky.
I usually cut the crust off bread.
Your answer is right.
My university has dormitories.
I'm a senior.
What do you see?
Tom looked a bit surprised.
Tom swam with the manta rays.
I lost the hat I bought in Boston.
Could you open the window?
I'd like a book.

I'll pass.
She comes from California.
Tom wasn't ready to die.
The noise gets on my nerves.

I felt sad for no reason.
Leave a message and I'll call you.
Tom said he hadn't known about it.
I have to go to a funeral today.
Will you let me try once more?
None of your business.
Will I see you tonight?

I've lost interest in it.
Ask the policeman over there.
There isn't enough space here for forty people.
Tom bought a small gift for Mary.
He only had 100 dollars.
I looked around me.

May I run with you?
Watch out for that man.
He is thick-headed.
They're nice guys.
Please breathe through your nose.
I had never been kissed like that before.

Did you notice him coming in?
Stop bothering Tom.
Let Tom rest.

Tom isn't as patient as Mary is.
It is not easy to speak English.
I won't take tomorrow off.
He acted as chairman.
Put yourself in my position.
My father objected to our marriage.
I was really worried about Tom.

"If the weather is nice, I'll go out tomorrow."
We'll help you.
You should throw it away.
I think otherwise.
It rained on and off all day.
Tom forgot to sign his name.
I washed my clothes in the river.
Roll up your sleeves and get busy.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
This watch is a real bargain.
Please tell him to wait.
Things are only going to get worse.
He put the gun to his head.
The students wanted us to help push the car.
No one knew how to answer the question.

I don't see your point.
"If I had wings to fly, I'd have gone to save her."
I enjoy being with you.
"I have a toothache, so I can't eat anything."
He turned out to be her father.
I almost never watch TV.
Hi.
Could you translate this into French for me?
I've changed jobs.
It seems that dinner will be late.
I think we'd better wait another thirty minutes.

Hospitals are very expensive.
She is a well-known singer.
Make sure you tell Tom.
That doesn't exist.
She failed to understand a single word.
There is no school during August.
Which class is Tom in?
I knew you'd be mad.
I have a serious problem.
I've caught a terrible cold.
I hate children.
It snowed yesterday evening.
Can you jump rope?
The boy lost his way in the forest.
It was a casual meeting.
"If you turn to the left, you'll see a white building."
I took it that you would come.
Six o'clock will suit me very well.
Did you eat?
How old were you the first time that you drank wine?
The park is filled with children.
Would you mind if I sleep here tonight?
Why is Tom always so grouchy?
I'll remember that.
Where's the dressing room?
"No matter what he says, don't trust him."
I hid in the basement.
"I didn't like the music in the store, so I left without buying anything."
Put on a jacket. It's cold.
Everything is over.
I've already read this book.
Is there any place around here where I can rent a bicycle?
Earthquakes and floods are natural disasters.
My brother isn't busy.
Welcome back.
This water isn't cold.
"I thought we had eaten everything in the house, but I found another box of crackers."
Do you have a pain reliever?
Does your back still hurt?
I had a hasty breakfast and left home.
I eat breakfast at eight o'clock.
When does the train to Boston leave?
I advised the shy young man to declare his love for the beautiful girl.
"Tom was supposed to buy flowers for Mary, but he forgot."
It isn't like I'm completely happy right now.
Quality is more important than quantity.
What're you reading?
My father has never been sick in his life.
I have been to Europe twice.
I won't tell you my address.
Tom is engaged to Mary's younger sister.
I don't like to mix business with pleasure.
I'm stuffed.
She's acting on instinct.
I'm a woman and I don't think that it's strange at all.
I'm an archaeologist.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Tom told me that he loves me.
How long are you going to stay?
Is there a bank near the train station?
Hurry or we'll be late.
Tom was almost hit by a car.
Tom sighed deeply.
Love doesn't exist.
Switzerland has several official languages.
This is the hottest summer we have had in fifty years.
It was unfortunate.
Does the price of the room include the service charges?
There used to be huts in this area.
I bought some potatoes.
I want you to have a definite plan before you leave.
I'm a Canadian.
He has no trouble climbing trees.
Have you been to Boston?
There were a crowd of people in the park.
I'm looking after Tom.
Raspberries are expensive in the winter.
Are these sunglasses Tom's?
How do you usually say it?
We learn English at school.
They each received a present.
There are a lot of rocks in this garden.
"If you do that again, I'll spank you."
My hobby is listening to music.
Tom is always busy on Mondays.
Don't look out the window.
"Are you hungry? ""No, not really."""
We think Tom may be in trouble.
Tom walks to school.
There's a magazine in my room.
I don't like talking with Tom.
What should I bring?
"When I got home, my mother and father were quarreling."
I stole the ring.
"It started raining, so I got under my friend's umbrella."
My skin feels really rough today.
Have you mopped the kitchen floor yet?
Did you study hard in high school?
I just remembered that I was supposed to buy a loaf of bread.
Don't you remember what I said?
Please send me a catalog.
Do it before the end of this week.
Tom should've paid Mary.
What'll you eat today?
Tom's cellphone rang and he answered it.
I'm glad I could be of service.
I wonder where I put my glasses.
I had lunch with Tom.
How long can I borrow this book?
It's been raining on and off since last night.
I could not find it anyplace.
Tom can't eat now.
It's a very sad story.
This will heal soon.
We're encouraged to use our imagination.
It sounds like a fun job.
I think I've met her before.
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before.
I'm doing okay.
I apologize for the late reply.
There is a bridge two miles upstream.
I wonder why Tom can't do that.
He came at about four o'clock.
Just looking at the food made my mouth water.
That child threw a stone at the dog.
Give me some milk.
Are there any balls here?
Are there any movie theaters near here?
Do you hate us?
It won't succeed.
Are you sure it was Tom and not Mary who did that?
The water has been cut off.
How can I thank you?
You can sit down now.
Please hurry!
I wasn't invited to Tom's party.
"Sorry, but that's not what I ordered."
I will do it right now.
He is crazy about skiing.
She is a good English speaker.
Tom's dog is brown.
I have one.
I am talking with Tom.
I work in a hospital.
When did you get here?
No one went near him.
"Tom is already home, right?"
Tom plans to retire the year after next.
There is no longer any room for doubt.
I'm a good cook.
The traveler stopped to ask me the way.
Tom persuaded her into going to the movies with him.
We are good friends.
Is this all yours?
Is it still up in the attic?
The food here isn't very good.
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't swim well.
Do you often lie to your husband?
What's the number?
Tom said he wouldn't win.
Don't smoke so much.
How far is it to the station?
"I'm going shopping. Do you want to come? ""Sure!"""
My body aches all over.
This is my dog.
Let's try again.
All of us got into the car.
I can't study with you watching me.
"After he left school, he went to London."
I'm at the office.
She came up to me and asked my name.
She is about my age.
Let's meet this afternoon.
That sounds easy.
It's snowing.
It's too late now.
Do you have pictures of the apartment?
Tom's mother used to be a singer.
He is telling a lie.
"Oh boy, that's embarrassing."
This is too small.
Tom thought that Mary was asleep.
I can't wait to shower.
I love this mobile phone.
There is no need for him to work.
This is never going to end.
You seem to have made considerable progress since our last meeting.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Look out for pickpockets.
I'd like to go home early today.
Tom was the one who called the police.
Tom put Mary to bed.
"To our surprise, Tom came to our party with Mary."
I completely forgot.
Was anybody in there?
Tom went to Boston once.
The sky grew darker and darker.
The nonviolent actions of Martin Luther King inspired many people.
I still love Tom.
Everybody knows that.
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
I noticed several people sleeping during the concert.
No one complained about that.
I can't afford to do that.
Tom is buying a new house.
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
"Suddenly, my mother started singing."
May I ask you to do me a favor?
It's a time-consuming task.
"If you take medicine, you will feel better."
I opened the door and went inside.
It took me more than three hours to translate that report into French.
Tom was happy to be home after being away for so long.
"Without water, you could not live."
Is it true you can't speak French?
You go first.
"When the fire broke out, he was sound asleep."
"It's raining, so we should go home."
There are some empty bottles in the box.
It's time for dinner.
I am not about to pay ten dollars.
Tom was wearing shabby clothes.
I almost threw up.
I listen to the news on the radio.
I'm planning to go to graduate school.
"When people meet, first impressions determine more than 50 percent of whatever happens next."
She came from Canada to see me.
Is this Tom's bag?
Tom became a history teacher.
We're studying physical science.
Benjamin Franklin was an American statesman and inventor.
"Tom is very forgetful, isn't he?"
You still look like a high school student.
You have to look out for other cars when you drive.
I don't want to buy that bag.
I feel itchy everywhere.
I never want to talk to Tom again.
I hardly ever walk to work.
You should tell your mother as soon as possible.
This color doesn't suit you.
Tom's drunk.
I didn't know that Tom could speak French.
I didn't like beer at that time.
I need someone to help me.
Are you closer to your mother or to your father?
I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that has met Tom Jackson.
My brother is in Australia now.
Look into the box.
This problem is too difficult for elementary school children to solve.
"Come to the front, please."
Were Tom and Mary here when you arrived?
He did not know what to say.
I don't see much of him.
Was Tom at home last night?
The wind became stronger.
The fingerprints left on the weapon match the suspect's.
What did you do with that car?
She suddenly kissed me.
Tom still can't speak French.
"Not only Tom has to study, but I have to study, too."
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
I like to wear clogs.
This restaurant is famous for its excellent cuisine.
You can go home now.
Tom almost cried.
Tom is sure to pass the examination.
I used to do that a lot.
Tom lit the stove.
He is not what he used to be.
Please wait a little while.
It is on me.
My room number is 5.
Is there space for one more person?
Is that a personal opinion?
Please make sure that the door is locked.
I couldn't see anything at all.
Let's forget about what happened today.
I got my hair cut.
I don't think Tom is as stubborn as Mary.
I lost my arm in the war.
He cleared his throat before starting the lecture.
Tom enjoys playing tricks on me.
That movie is exciting.
I usually have lunch here.
The library is open from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
We moved into a new house.
That stuff is poison.
I think we may have met somewhere before.
I shouldn't have logged off.
How long will this cold weather go on?
I'd like to know the rest of the story.
Please give me some more coffee.
My brother's in Australia now.
Is this your house?
He handed in his resignation.
Are they still thinking about it?
It was handmade.
My hair is a mess because the wind is very strong.
"During the war, he served in the army."
This is what he said.
"At this point, I'm unable to comment on that problem."
I don't like the perfume that Mary is wearing today.
This is a fly.
Tom can't see you.
I feel happy.
We went to the movies last night.
What's wrong with Tom? He looks a little pale.
My mother is a lawyer.
This is a good dictionary for high school students.
My heart started beating faster.
"In the evening, I went for a walk in the park."
"Seriously though, episode 21 made me laugh so hard I almost cried."
Are you pulling my leg?
I agree with you.
Don't go anywhere.
It is Sunday tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell me about it sooner?
I often play tennis after school.
You talk fast.
I'm tired.
Tom saw them.
"I heard that Tom and John are identical twins. They really do look alike, don't they? ""Yes, they really do look very similar. Even their parents say they get confused sometimes. Those two really are very similar, aren't they?"""
We also went to the temple.
There's no food left.
When do you use it?
I think it's better if we get divorced.
Could you tell me the way to the zoo?
What did you do last night?
Tom ate all the cookies.
It was obvious to everyone that he was tired.
She walked in the woods.
She has a hot temper.
It's on the first floor.
The dew is on the leaves of grass.
I regret that I did not work harder.
She lost a book.
I've never been absent from school.
We rarely get snow here.
He bought eggs and milk from a farmer.
Tom is more interesting than Mary.
Were both Tom and Mary late for class?
Why don't we take a short break?
"Tom was here, but Mary wasn't."
He looks older than my brother.
He stayed up late last night.
What's the nationality of that cameraman over there?
I saw Tom in the mirror so I turned around and said hi.
He died of gastric cancer.
Did you see him at the station this morning?
Is it true that you're going to Boston?
My family goes skiing every winter.
Do you feel like you have a fever?
Whales feed on small fish.
They walked around.
This is an important letter.
This is a mistake students are apt to make.
Tom was in his junior year in college.
Tom told me he doesn't know what he has to do.
No one can force you to do anything against your will.
What're you doing?
Are you going to open the envelope?
What astonishes me is that he never learns his lesson.
"I know you're upset about your car being totaled, but you weren't injured and you should be thankful to be alive."
That's funny.
I'll bet you that you're wrong about that.
I have to find a part-time job.
Where is my clock?
I'm not at liberty to tell you about the incident.
His story was made up.
We all enjoyed the movie.
That software was released six months ago.
The vacation is over now.
"At last, we reached our destination."
No one said anything to me.
Tom promised not to go out alone.
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
I'd like to rent a larger apartment.
Oh! That's too bad.
When did Tom and Mary get married?
I'm computer illiterate.
Remember to mail the letter.
I can't swim.
The doctor told me to drink more water to prevent dehydration.
Didn't you know Tom was Mary's boyfriend?
Tom has ambitious goals.
Will you tell me where to buy the ticket?
I have heard nothing from him yet.
Could you please wait a minute?
Why don't you ask for a pay raise?
What're you talking about?
The baby in the cradle is very pretty.
Please keep this a secret.
Tom said that he's hungry.
It's a lot heavier than it looks.
Is that a camel?
I have a head cold.
I'm worn out.
There were forty people present.
That's difficult to explain.
I've already returned the keys.
Tom hates his job.
"Could you close the window, please?"
"If we should miss the express, we'll take the next train."
He is not what he used to be.
That boy talks like a girl.
"You're seeing that, aren't you?"
The battery died.
I still have to get rid of this carpet.
Let's take a short rest here. My legs are tired and I can't walk any more.
I'm listening to a podcast in French.
Tom is resilient.
The shop is closed today.
He bought me a new dictionary.
You ought to do that right now.
"Oh, sorry, I didn't know it was illegal."
Let's begin.
Our fridge is broken.
Are you a bully?
May I feel these?
She always wears clothes which are out of fashion.
Tom is accustomed to speaking in public.
Who's your favorite Canadian singer?
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
Tom and Mary got married last spring.
Either day would be OK.
Tom has a natural talent.
I am writing a letter.
This blue sweater is very pretty.
He likes ham and eggs.
We can't make a change in our schedule.
Ho Chi Minh City is the largest city in Vietnam.
Your problem is that you give up too easily.
Your payment is now two months overdue.
This wine is delicious.
I work three days a week.
I agree with you absolutely.
What in the world is this?
Tom and John fell in love with the same girl.
Tom must be from Australia.
The animal struggled to get out of the cage.
Tom misses his family.
Can I use your phone?
Did you play tennis?
My sister can play the guitar very well.
He said that he would be back soon.
What should I do next?
You should be prepared for emergencies.
It would be better if you didn't eat before going to bed.
I take off my hat to you.
It is said that she is a good cook.
Is all this money yours?
Wait till I count to ten.
My cat loves toys.
That train stops at every station.
Tom was dismissed without notice.
Please wait for thirty minutes.
I wonder if Tom likes Chinese food.
This is the reason that she succeeded as a pop singer.
Tom was drenched from head to toe.
My bicycle has a flat.
What do you usually eat for breakfast?
I will sue you.
I want to drink some water.
Tom looked like he was somewhere in his late thirties.
Don't be so greedy.
I'm calling from Tom's place.
I don't feel like taking a walk this morning.
The dog is in the house.
Tom had a brain tumor.
I thought that that book was difficult to read.
He is holding his books under his arm.
I hear that even taxi drivers often get lost in Tokyo.
Tom was hit by lightning on the beach and died.
"It will hurt a little, but not much."
I received two of your messages.
I'm surprised that your family has a Japanese car.
He came to Tokyo at the age of three.
I don't think it would be wise to argue with Tom.
Mom prepared lunch for me.
She acted like a real baby.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak more than three languages.
We want to win.
What's your maiden name?
Tom doesn't know about Mary's death yet.
The corridor was so crowded that we couldn't walk.
"You've never been to Europe, have you?"
I don't like singing in public.
Don't be fresh with me.
"It's cheap, isn't it?"
I soon found the store I was looking for.
It's been a while since I've had pasta.
She bought a handkerchief for ten dollars.
Tom rides a motorcycle to work.
I completely forgot it.
Can you get the work finished in time?
Tom spent three days in the hospital.
Could I please have one more can of beer?
"If you leave your textbooks at school during the break, they'll get confiscated."
Tom filled the bathtub up with hot water.
You have to go alone.
I was at a friend's house.
That nickname fits you perfectly.
"When I got up, the sun was already high in the sky."
Tom is three inches taller than his wife is.
You look just like your dad.
"Will it be hot tomorrow, too?"
The dirty boy turned out to be a prince in disguise.
Tom doesn't like me.
Did you live here before?
When did Tom go?
"I tried to answer the question, but I couldn't."
It was less than one kilometer to the village post office.
"Don't move, or I'll shoot you."
The top of the mountain is covered with snow.
Don't play here.
Tom is on good terms with John.
I don't know anything.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
"Tom, your mother's here."
Where did you go today?
Don't forget there are exceptions.
Tom noticed that Mary was asleep.
Have you ever tried to do that?
Everything looks exactly the same.
I'm interested in creating my own website.
I'll be your tour guide.
I still don't have a smartphone.
I live close to a convenience store.
Phone me later.
Tom probably can't speak French.
Does anyone feel sick?
He reads before bedtime.
We have to solve that problem first.
I'll set the alarm for seven o'clock.
I haven't been able to solve the problem yet.
Tom isn't helpful.
Let's not talk about Tom tonight.
He stood behind me.
It won't be long before they get married.
Tom finished reading that book in one night.
Do you know what's happening?
Do you have any beer?
Mary is a working mom.
It isn't as bad as you think.
Craftsmanship isn't something that can be learned overnight.
Would you like some fruit?
Tom is hard to please.
She kept quiet.
Everyone must memorize those words.
Let's go as soon as it stops raining.
"On average, how many times per minute does a person blink?"
I live with my dad.
I have a black and white dog.
Christmas comes but once a year.
Tom is now almost as tall as his father.
You shouldn't eat too much candy.
It is best to review the material before the presentation.
I have a fish tank.
I'm amused.
"If I'd known that, I wouldn't have come."
He is afraid his wife is not very domestic.
It's good to hear your voice again.
My daughter has grown out of all her old clothes.
Tom loves riding motorcycles.
How about you?
I was in a hurry and fell down the stairs.
What does Tom eat for breakfast?
The bus has just left.
Tom is a talkative child.
Who were you talking with?
It takes an hour to get to the station on foot.
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
"Don't go out now. ""Why not?"""
Gasoline is sold by the liter.
Your problem is similar to mine.
Did you sprain your ankle?
She was brave.
I'm thinking of translating this into French.
This is the worst storm in ten years.
Do you want to rest?
What are you guys doing?
I've just finished it.
"If that guitar were not so expensive, I could buy it."
Do you like to cook?
I have lots of affairs to look after.
That's not a proper thing to say.
A rope was thrown into the water.
I think Tom is almost deaf.
I'd like to eat something sweet.
It is raining hard.
I bought two bags of popcorn.
The operation was a complete success.
This diamond is fake.
This is why I don't have a boyfriend.
The storm prevented her from arriving on time.
Tom and Mary's children like strawberries.
I also had a very good time.
I am fond of reading.
It doesn't matter to me if you take that book.
The cause of the fire is not known.
Would you believe me if I told you that I loved you?
Mary put a note in Tom's lunchbox telling him not to forget to buy bread on his way home.
Call me once in a while.
Tom ate some of my rice while I was away from the table.
I ate a light lunch.
"So far, everything's been going well."
I'll be back at half past six.
It was not until I came to Japan that I ate sashimi.
It's Tom's birthday today.
I had a cup of coffee at the cafe.
There's nobody in that room.
See you the week after next week.
I ate breakfast in my pajamas.
Tom should be at home.
May I ask you to do me a favor?
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
"When it rains, it pours."
He showed courage in the face of danger.
You shouldn't judge a person by his looks.
"The concert was short. However, it was very good."
I can't eat.
I have to dress up.
I hid under the bed.
How about taking a walk before breakfast?
I'd like to watch TV.
Please don't feed the animals.
Step aside.
I have a reservation for six-thirty.
Let's take a rest here.
I'm relieved.
I want to save money.
Please turn down the volume.
This is why Tom doesn't like cats.
"Anyway, I'll call you tomorrow."
Stand still!
I've been looking for you.
My mother likes tulips very much and so does my sister.
School begins the day after tomorrow.
"I thought the bus was free, but I had to pay."
That's a very pretty name.
I'll give it back next Monday without fail.
I don't want to eat any more.
My mother is sick in bed.
How long does it take to get to the train station?
I did nothing during the holidays.
I'm selfish.
I wonder if my life is worth living.
Mary continued to work despite her illness.
I put on my clothes in a hurry.
Tom wrote a love letter to Mary.
Do you know when Tom died?
We spent a quiet day in the country.
Is Tom looking at me?
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom skipped French class today.
The weather forecast was right.
"No one's perfect, except me."
A foreign language can't be mastered in a year or so.
She is proficient in French.
"Tom isn't in your class, is he?"
Tom swims as well as Mary does.
He hurt his left foot when he fell.
What on earth happened to Tom?
I went to the supermarket and bought rice.
Let's arrange the details later.
I wonder how Tom put up with Mary for so many years.
You're very attractive in blue.
The door had a big gold star on it.
We saw a mummy at the museum.
Would you please shut the window?
Do whatever you want.
Come whenever you want.
Please hold on a moment.
What is your name?
Nothing else matters.
See you on the weekend.
I've got a question for you.
I've often been there.
The child next door was showing off his brand new bicycle to his friends.
I don't know how many cousins Tom has.
I didn't go anywhere during the holiday.
"What's the word for ""kaisha"" in English?"
He goes to school on foot.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow morning.
You're supposed to knock before you enter someone's office.
It won't hurt.
I think I've heard this before.
She was carrying her baby in her arms.
Let's give it one more try.
Tom never stops to think.
The soldiers got to the foot of the hill before dawn.
Tom and Mary plan on staying there as long as they can.
I thought the same thing.
Never stay away from school without good cause.
Tom is now almost as tall as his father is.
"By the way, what is your address?"
They concluded that he had told a lie.
"Because it was very cold yesterday, I stayed home."
I was always proud of my mother.
This book is meant for children.
I'm the one who paid for that ticket.
Does Tom ever go to Boston?
The lake supplies the city with water.
This is a post office and that's a bank.
I was confused by the expression on Tom's face.
"Christmas is soon, right?"
I'm not sure if he saw it.
I'm looking for my cat.
I cycle to work.
"A week from today, I'll be in England."
You shouldn't do it.
Water is to fish what air is to man.
"Tom grew up in Boston, but he now lives in Chicago."
Do you know how to play the game?
School begins at nine and is over at six.
"Tom, is it true you're dating Mary?"
Tom passed the test.
Which word fits better here?
She asked me if I agreed with her.
He left his umbrella on the bus.
Hello. Fancy meeting you here.
Tom really loves Mary a lot.
What kind of books do you like?
"I screamed for help, but no one came."
I may be wrong.
Walking is the best exercise.
She has brown eyes.
Tom isn't as handsome as John.
How could I forget?
Let's start again.
Should I tell my mother?
Do you remember your father's birthday?
They live there.
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
Did Tom tell you anything about where he works?
Is this Tom's bike?
This cottage reminds me of the one I was born in.
I'm always thirsty.
Have you tried apologizing to Tom?
Tell me what you're arguing about.
She is looking for a large apartment.
I’ve always wanted to have a pet squirrel.
I think that Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
There's still so much to be done.
I have a lot to do today.
A bunch of people told me not to eat there.
He kept an eye on them.
I was writing letters all morning.
I agree.
I haven't decided yet whether I'll go to college or get a job.
"Apples were on sale today, so I bought a lot of them."
"If it had not been for your help, my father would have failed."
"In Switzerland, spring comes in May."
It's very beautiful there in the summer.
I don't remember where I met Tom the first time.
This country has a mild climate.
I barely escaped being hit by the truck.
What an interesting book!
This is really important to me.
"If I drop out of contact, let the police know, OK?"
Do you have some time?
I heard the news through the grapevine.
I like dogs better than cats.
Tom is an introvert.
I was wondering if you'd let me stay with you for a few days.
I think I'd better stay here.
Let's change channels. This program isn't very interesting.
Come into the room at once.
I am happy to hear your voice.
He loves fishing.
I'll stay at home if it rains tomorrow.
What sound does a sheep make?
Tom always wears his seatbelt.
The rumor was completely without foundation.
You may go.
English is spoken in Canada.
I wrote her name down so I wouldn't forget it.
Tom walks his dog every morning.
I try to be positive all the time.
"Let's go by taxi, OK?"
Come downstairs as soon as possible.
"Excuse me, but could you lend me a pen?"
This honey is very thick.
Tom remained single all his life.
I really need to get some sleep.
Why do you like playing baseball?
"This pen is yours, right?"
Please fill out the Customs Declaration Form.
"Sorry, but it looks like I'm booked up on that day."
I need to go to Chicago.
Do you want any of these flowers?
You may use my computer if you want to.
She gets up early every morning.
"I, too, am happy."
I think Tom is good-looking.
Boil one egg.
Thanks for the tip.
Every family has a skeleton in the closet.
It's the rainy season.
How about taking a rest?
I think it'll snow tomorrow.
"You're tired, aren't you? Why don't you get to bed?"
I hung around for one hour.
I help him.
When were potatoes introduced into Japan?
"Translate this into French, please."
I found the key I was looking for.
I was the first one to do that.
I don't want to say any more than that.
I had difficulty getting a ticket for the concert.
I must buy a new winter coat.
"What! This T-shirt is 3,000 yen? This is a rip-off!"
Some day you'll regret this.
I think you had better stick to your present job.
Is Tom asleep?
He arrived in time.
"For breakfast, I had two eggs and a burnt piece of toast."
When did you marry your wife?
Do you have any games on your phone?
I cannot afford the time for a vacation.
Are you ready for Halloween?
Everyone thinks so.
I can be good.
It was delicious.
Don't forget to get vaccinated.
Tom met Mary on his way to school.
Where have you been up to now?
"In the summer, eggs go bad quickly."
We'll be together all the time.
The government was obliged to make changes in its foreign policy.
That's why I told you not to go by yourself.
Who is the owner of this house?
Give me some time to think it over.
What does this word mean?
Good evening.
I think I'm really not any good at German.
"What are you doing, Dad?"
I'll accomplish that no matter what the cost.
He'll probably finish the work by tomorrow.
I stayed home all weekend.
She was racked with pain.
They want to participate in the Olympic Games.
I bought various pieces of cloth.
I'll call them tomorrow when I return home.
What are you looking for?
I understand exactly what Tom is going through.
I'm so happy right now.
"This flower is beautiful, isn't it?"
I'll get off at the next station.
Paper burns easily.
Next year is a leap year.
I'm on duty from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Tom is my friend.
She has put her house up for sale.
Do you have today's tickets?
Can I use your telephone?
I'm at a loss what to do.
It's sort of strange.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
My annual income exceeds five million yen.
Don't sass me.
It was a quick decision.
It is very kind of you to say so.
Tom fainted.
Are you angry?
Please wait a moment.
Would you like to come over to our house for dinner?
She turned off the lights.
Thank you for the coffee.
I don't want to tell you my name.
I advised him to give up smoking.
No one speaks French here.
We smell with our noses.
Why didn't you wake me up?
The burglar came into the house through this door.
She went on working.
Stop picking on people.
We must prevent war at any cost.
Are you still tense?
Tom just took his last breath.
The keys were under the couch.
There's a lot of glare.
Tom's car got stuck in the snow.
He scolded her.
I will stay at home.
Tom arrived first.
Maybe we should've done that.
I didn't miss my watch till I got home.
Tom saw a man wearing a hat standing next to Mary and wondered who he was.
Our neighbors complained about our dogs barking.
That's not a fir tree.
Some children don't like vegetables.
I'd rather stay here.
This asparagus is delicious.
The food at that restaurant wasn't all that good.
You really made me lose face.
How many more days are there until Christmas?
The bus arrived ten minutes late.
Tom looked a bit shaken.
This problem is really complicated.
The baseball game was put off till next Sunday.
Would you like a drink?
Are you still collecting stamps?
I'm already accustomed to sitting on tatami.
Is there any place around here where I can rent a bicycle?
I can't kiss you now.
Japan and Britain are island countries.
The room was full of people.
Don't get mad.
She has an advantage over me.
It was necessary.
"Perseverance, as you know, is the key to success."
I still want to go.
"On hearing the news, Tom fainted."
"Oh, don't worry about that."
A small stream runs by my house.
Let me give you some advice.
He gave a minute description of the dinner party.
I'm going to Tom's next week.
Tom has been hunting for a job since he lost his previous job last year.
There is little room for doubt.
You can read this book.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
What's the difference between a magazine and a newspaper?
It's almost ten o'clock.
I've come to say goodbye.
I'd like to drink some tea or coffee.
What time is it now?
I used to watch TV at least three hours every day.
Tom might object.
He speaks ten languages.
She climbed down from the roof.
Tom has spent some time doing that.
This gym has a climbing wall.
Could you show me the campus?
It's clear that you're wrong.
"The lamp went out, and all was black."
The water is icy.
How many Christmas cards did you send?
Would you like a window seat?
Did you come to town?
I feel perfectly fine.
The door will not open.
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
Do we have school today?
Don't let go of the rope.
Do you have laundry service?
Tom wasn't in the kitchen.
Man first visited the moon in 1969.
Tom is yawning.
Please buy this for me.
Tom didn't know I was Mary's brother.
Tom said that he was worried about Mary.
What do you think of his suggestion?
You should visit Boston at least once.
I'd like some cheese.
My head aches.
He left a while ago.
We're sorry we weren't able to help you.
You can take your time.
I have a favor to ask of you.
School starts next Monday.
It is especially hot today.
Hand in your report by tomorrow.
This paper is rough.
This is a bus stop.
"If you're going to tuck your shirt into your jeans, you should wear a belt."
Tom is a good person.
He has a lot of money in the bank.
Tom is very rich.
"In Japan, are nurses high on the social scale?"
I passed all my tests.
Europeans like to drink wine.
The bottle of wine that I bought this afternoon is in the fridge.
It's 2:30 now.
Did the police find any trace of the murderer?
Do you eat breakfast at home?
There's a beauty parlor next to the station.
I'd like to change my image.
"Hey, what're you doing tomorrow night?"
Your demands are unreasonable.
Work is everything to me.
How old is your oldest son?
I don't think Tom wanted to talk about that.
Where does the airport bus leave from?
"If I were you, I'd wait."
That's the point.
We've painted the walls white.
"I want to become a pilot, like my father."
I hope Tom will agree to do that.
I'm not going to let you go back to Boston.
Are there any messages for me?
It never rains but it pours.
I took two pictures.
Who wrote this letter?
At last it's stopped raining.
Would you like a single room?
Did you see the end of the movie?
Join us.
Don't lie.
"We get tired of beautiful women in three days, but in three days, we get used to ugly women."
Tom's hands were tied behind his back.
You really annoy me.
He died of a heart attack.
Tom tossed the ball to Mary.
I can't understand why Tom doesn't want to go with us.
Please put the book on the shelf.
You should write it down before you forget it.
No one believed Tom's story.
It is more blessed to give than to receive.
Call me tomorrow at 9 o'clock.
Have you ever seen a spider spinning a web?
I wrote it for Tom.
He became a pianist.
That answer's incorrect.
Is there a flight in the afternoon?
Tom took his cap off.
Where did you find this wallet?
I don't know if there is time.
She spends most of her money on clothes.
Can you snap your fingers?
If I had more money I could buy this.
A little boy greeted me.
I'll email you.
"When you travel abroad, you usually need a passport."
I've already eaten lunch.
Can you keep the noise down?
Thank you for coming to see me off.
That money isn't mine.
Tom likes Mary just the way she is.
"What's Grandma doing? ""She's sleeping on the couch."""
It will be hot tomorrow.
Who were you speaking with?
This book goes on the top shelf.
Where's the TV remote?
You can count on Tom.
Stop speaking right now.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
Mary pulled her hair in a bun.
No one can operate this machine.
It's too small for me.
I had a very good time in Boston.
Tom had never used a washing machine before.
It wasn't always this way.
You're the one who planted that tree.
I'll see you later.
Show me what you have in your left hand.
There's a little wind.
I heard that Tom is in the hospital.
You should go to the gym.
There are twelve months in a year.
There is a lake in front of my house.
I'm the one who made that decision.
"The other day he said to me, ""I will lend you this book tomorrow."""
Pasta is high in carbohydrates.
Tom doesn't do anything without Mary.
I invited my friends.
Everyone has skeletons in their closet.
"Give it to me, please."
I thought you said that you were afraid to do that.
Please don't make me go to school anymore.
Do you have colored pencils?
I accepted her invitation.
He asked me where my uncle lived.
I like short poems.
Tom isn't alone now.
That dog is too dangerous to be left loose.
You don't have to worry about funds.
Have you ever been to Canada?
I have my passport.
Do you really think Tom is mean?
I was a member.
What's your favorite spice?
London is among the world's largest cities.
She has a pretty doll.
The airport isn't very far from here.
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
"Two's company, three's a crowd."
Please move out of the way so this lady can go through.
We were caught in a shower while we were on a picnic.
When would you like to have your coffee?
Tom used to sell cars.
You should fulfill your promises.
She keeps complaining that she has no time.
I don't know what's wrong.
The exit is on the left.
"No, I didn't go."
He insulted me in public.
"Be quiet, all of you."
Please follow me.
This is not good.
He is very handsome.
Why are you in such a hurry?
The village needs your help.
Could you wait a moment?
Put this in your bag.
There is a small pond here.
The poor girl went out of her mind.
Do you think I'm handsome?
I assume that we're doing a pretty good job since nobody has complained.
I am not alone in this opinion.
I'm a little hesitant to ask a favor of that person.
It may freeze next week.
Do you have any sisters?
Who told you I couldn't speak French?
Tom is rude.
It's going to be a hot day.
It's too late to apologize now.
"The bill, please."
He takes a bath every morning.
Are you leaving now?
"When he was a child, he went to Paris three times."
Is Tom in a band?
Tom and Mary planned to meet at the botanical garden.
Why don't we get married?
I spent twelve hours on the train.
Is it OK to take pictures here?
Have you ever eaten that?
I have a broken ankle.
I also went.
This is a view of the Alps.
Tom went outside for the first time in a long time.
There used to be an old temple here.
Is it easy to install?
Make your dreams come true.
I didn't know that you were such a good cook.
The place where he lives is far from town.
Tom is working upstairs.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom goes to school on foot.
I had not waited ten minutes before Mary came.
Some people say they like the smell of durian.
Please speak in a louder voice.
"When I was in school, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands."
Would you mind taking a picture of us?
The situation is worse than I thought.
Do you really speak that language?
She's smaller than me.
Mary smiled at me yesterday.
Any paper will do.
I didn't think that Tom would be so depressed.
I've decided to jog every morning.
Faith can move mountains.
I don't care what that guy says.
Everybody seems to be in a bad mood.
I've never gone to Boston.
Did you enjoy the movie?
"Seeing that it is 8 o'clock, I think you should leave for school soon."
Tom's drunk.
Are you going outside?
Why's this so cheap?
I have to change buses two times.
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
I went to the bookstore.
I felt much more relaxed.
Are you guys idiots?
I'll do my best.
Is Tom still mad at me?
Please help yourself to the fruit.
Were there any stars in the sky?
What are you searching for?
It's hanging up in the closet.
I am supposed to meet her at three this afternoon.
Do you know how to play that game?
I can't figure out what the writer is trying to say.
Don't feed the dog.
I put my suitcase in the trunk.
I'm allergic to gluten.
This garden is lovely.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like your haircut."
"Mom, Tom pinched me."
His extensive knowledge surprises me.
I don't believe Tom is a spy.
I don't live in Boston now.
Won't you come with me?
"Tom is in the kitchen, washing dishes."
Our factories are working at full capacity.
I'm glad to see you.
I hadn't gone a mile when it began to rain.
This wall feels cold.
I wake up at half past six in the morning.
The game was a 2-2 draw.
This diver's watch is a little too expensive.
Can I sit down?
He has three daughters.
"You're going to bed early, right?"
It's interesting.
That guy really burns me up.
Don't talk to Tom right now.
I'm not at all tired.
"If you speak French, I won't understand."
Where did you find this pen?
This engine works well.
I'd like to open a restaurant in this neighborhood someday.
I'd like to page someone.
I prefer red wine to white wine.
It's not something anyone can do.
Chuck's Diner has closed.
Were you busy last Monday?
Meeting my old friend was very pleasant.
Thank you.
What's in your trunk?
I don't think Tom is back from Australia yet.
He closed his eyes.
Tom decided to sell his car.
A tall boy is standing at the gate.
"Could you please buy me a book? ""What kind of book?"""
Don't take everything so seriously.
More than 40 percent of the students go to university.
This dictionary is primarily intended for high school students.
It doesn't rain much on this side of the mountain.
"Where there's a will, there's a way."
I helped her.
I fell asleep while listening to the radio.
He was too angry to speak.
I walked along the river.
Can I borrow your car tonight?
There was a momentary pause in the talk.
He was exposed to many dangers.
It's almost time to go to bed.
There were three people waiting in front of me.
I'm planning to leave for Europe next week.
Do you know what day it is?
I should've known better than to call Tom so late at night.
I can't imagine my life without you.
Glad to see you again.
Don't get steamed up.
I said I'm sorry.
I need colored pencils.
You don't have to talk so loud.
Let's take a 10-minute break here.
Are you sure you don't want to go to Australia with Tom?
"The phone is ringing. ""I'll get it."""
I can't remember that guy's name.
Are you vegan?
"When they're in danger, they run away."
I walked along the river.
The party had no sooner started than it began to rain.
I left my umbrella on the train.
I don't mind hot weather.
It'll cost at least five dollars.
His house is near the subway station.
Is it true that Tom doesn't like Mary?
It's hard to imagine.
I heard a scream.
Have you finished your homework?
Tom is a pretty good snowboarder.
I never thought something like this would happen.
I have seen a panda once.
Would you mind closing the window?
Tom didn't have time to think.
I'm sorry to trouble you.
May I eat this cake?
Tom usually goes to bed at ten-forty.
"Hi, everybody."
I knew that it wouldn't be that easy.
He sent me a present.
My dog is wagging his tail.
How much is the admission?
"Tom, can you take over?"
Tom is happier now that Mary has left.
I should have tried out this electric shaver before buying it.
Are you going to apologize to Tom?
She hears English all through the day.
"He speaks German, not to mention English."
Where can I put my bike?
It lasted for almost an hour.
Tom likes to drink.
None of my students would do that.
What time does Tom get up?
I met him the other day.
These shoes are too small for me to put on.
Tom shrugged his shoulders.
Tom said he apologized to Mary.
The accident happened a year ago today.
I think that's right.
He probably won't become famous.
How deep?
It's a firefly.
"Excuse me, can you lower your voice a little bit?"
I'm staying home today.
There's blood everywhere.
The smell of raw fish nauseates me.
Will you lend your dictionary to me?
It is never too late to learn.
Do I look rich?
No one's died.
I accepted her invitation.
Tom liked Mary's story.
I can't find the page I was looking for.
"I'll help, too."
When did you do this?
"You're tired, aren't you?"
I now want to drink beer.
"Hurry up, Tom."
Her English is excellent.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
"It was cold yesterday, but it's even colder today."
There's no sugar here.
The football game is now being broadcast.
This is where I get off.
I explained the reason in detail.
Do you like this book?
"If it's raining tomorrow, we'll go there by car."
He has a Japanese car.
I'm still working.
I like both dogs and cats.
He is an accountant at the company.
He abandoned his wife and children.
The ship carried hundreds of emigrants to the US.
My father gave up smoking last year.
You should concentrate on one thing and learn to do it well.
We left by train.
He is still alive.
What relieves the pain?
This car is too expensive.
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I advised her to come by 9:00.
Sharpen your pencil.
Do you catch colds often?
The man swimming in the river is my friend.
Tom can't remember where he put his passport.
Tom slept.
Can I borrow your radio?
It's hard for me to put my thoughts into words.
Would you like something to drink?
You can only go so far.
I'll give you a shot.
I said that.
I don't really like him anyway.
I can no longer remain silent.
Are you going to Tom's farewell party?
I'm sorry I have to go.
Go back to work.
"If it were me, I think I'd try going to a different hospital."
You shouldn't climb such a high mountain in the winter.
Stop bothering me!
This price is too high.
"Write it down here, please."
Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
Our company has many clients from abroad.
He talks as if he knows everything.
"It's hot outside, but cool indoors."
It'll take a while to go away.
Modern technology has made our lives more comfortable.
I think that everybody knows.
I think it's dangerous to swim in this lake.
Are you waiting for a bus?
He won the election by a large majority.
He accomplished it at last.
Dinner's ready.
I know Tom is a good teacher.
It's really hard to drive on the bumpy roads around here.
"If it snows tomorrow, I'll build a snowman."
The story of a great flood is very common in world mythology.
I usually only eat fruit for breakfast.
I'll go home by cab.
Fill it up.
There used to be a temple right here.
I'll phone Tom tonight.
I can't hide my feelings.
I'm proud of you.
"I think you'll come to like it, too."
Tom arrived home soaking wet.
I won't go if it rains.
I've spent all morning in line.
Are there any express trains?
He tried writing a short story.
Music preferences vary from person to person.
He is always cheerful.
My mother is a very good cook.
Do you know when they will arrive?
He was disappointed that things didn't turn out as he'd hoped.
Are you open on Sunday?
We were waiting for the shop to open.
Even a child can understand it.
Let's compromise.
May I join you?
Tom caught me by the arm.
Thank you for pushing me.
I'll leave it up to you.
The wind calmed down.
I'm not obsessed with money.
I'll go and look for Tom.
Does it hurt here?
What's the time now?
I belong to the rugby football club.
Take as much as you want to.
I felt a sharp pain in the stomach.
Is this seat empty?
You speak French fluently.
I have an ace up my sleeve.
My grandpa believes that the moon landing was a hoax.
You're kind to say so.
Tom is allergic to cats.
Were you at home last night?
I'm looking for someone to fall in love with.
He dreamed about his home.
This road is too narrow for trucks to pass.
"Tom, please open the door."
I'm going to see her off at the airport at 2:00.
"Well, I have to go now."
Tom is a better singer than you are.
You aren't consistent.
Disneyland was very interesting. You should've come with us.
I can speak French a little.
Don't do anything dangerous.
A car lying on its side blocked the passage.
Tom is coloring a picture.
The dish smells good.
Will I get well soon?
How do I get to Chinatown?
"Actually, I disagree with you."
It's difficult to estimate distance.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
Many college students use computers to write their papers.
I can't straighten my right arm.
She bought flour and oil in quantity.
I can't wait for that day to come.
I hear he's just begun looking for another job.
Keep a dictionary within easy reach.
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
Did Tom die in that accident?
Tom is naked from the waist up.
Are you going to go to Boston next week?
The boy put his hand in his pocket.
Are you going to stay long?
Tomorrow morning will be OK.
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
Can you stop bringing that up?
Why don't you have your bath now?
"No, I didn't go out."
That lawyer has many clients.
I was a bit embarrassed.
I assume that this idea will work well.
He lent me what little money he had.
I often have breakfast here.
Tom likes to show off.
This is the third time I've been here.
Get in here!
The flight was canceled because of the thick fog.
The rainbow has seven colors.
Tom is good at copy-and-pasting.
"At that time, I was still not asleep."
I think he's a great writer.
Tom started whining.
Mary stayed up late last night.
Read the note at the bottom of the page.
Tom is very optimistic.
He would often come to see me.
No problem.
I'm going to Boston for Thanksgiving.
I doubt that Tom did that on purpose.
I can't agree with you on that point.
I'm just joking.
Shall we wait for you here?
I should've bought a present for Tom.
I want his help.
The heavy rain prevented us from going fishing.
All we can do is hope.
We need to buy more food.
You should've known better than to trust Tom.
Relationships built on money will end when the money runs out.
Tom found a box in the attic.
He called me up from Tokyo.
Let's sit here for a while and look at the view.
The Prime Minister will hold a press conference tomorrow.
Can I do anything to help?
It seems very interesting.
I quit smoking and drinking.
Can I have a friend paged?
My friends came to see me yesterday.
My mother could speak five languages.
I take it for granted that you'll join.
I'll return at 6:30.
It's 2:30 now.
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
You don't need to finish it by tomorrow.
There's no place like Boston.
"Will you help me with my English homework? ""Certainly."""
"When she saw that they had no schools, she started one."
He likes Italian food.
Just stay at home.
I can't hear anything and I can't see anything.
I want to buy a laptop computer.
I think that everyone should study a foreign language.
Tom borrowed a lot of money from the bank.
Don't whine.
Don't lose heart.
The cherry blossoms are at their best now.
French is hard.
Your explanation is too abstract to me.
Please don't cut me off like that.
I think you should rest.
He had a bitter experience.
This chair needs to be fixed.
Can I borrow a pen?
In 1978 a peace treaty was concluded between Japan and China.
My friend broke up with his girlfriend and now he wants to go out with me.
We sat on a bench in the park.
I think he's correct.
I put on my shoes at once.
The desire he has had for years has been fulfilled.
I'd like you to sing a song.
I think my suitcase was stolen.
This is how the accident happened.
Tom will find Mary.
Empty your bag.
Can you explain why you dislike him?
He was sitting there.
We saw a castle in the distance.
You put things well.
I may have to study French.
Did you eat breakfast this morning?
The question is how to avoid nuclear war.
I see.
One man's medicine is another man's poison.
Are you ready to order now?
I don't think that you're crazy.
Please take charge of this key.
You'll have to study harder next year.
Tom is hitting Mary.
We might not need to go to the supermarket today.
We came back by way of Hong Kong.
The sea was as smooth as glass.
She hinted that she might study abroad.
Do you have some time?
You shouldn't speak ill of others.
The moon is pretty in the fall.
Tom said that he may go to Boston for Thanksgiving.
Would you like to go to a movie tonight?
I broke my leg and am on crutches.
I found the book easy.
How do I delete this file?
He finally decided to try.
Tom climbed into bed and turned off the light.
It's still cloudy.
I have something interesting to show you.
My father made me a nice lunch.
He's younger than me.
I live close to a convenience store.
The shop is closed on Sundays.
I have a black eye.
Watching wild birds is a lot of fun.
I used to play alone when I was a child.
Is it true that Tom got arrested?
Try to think outside the box.
This country is poor in natural resources.
Have you ever scratched your back with a backscratcher made in Japan?
Tom is now able to speak French.
Everyone always asks me that.
You may still do it if you want to.

You're kidding me.
"In my opinion, Tom is just a fool."
It's eight o'clock in the morning.
He's a mathematical genius.
I met my friends yesterday.
Would you mind turning off the radio?
I don't want to talk to Tom ever again.
"If it were OK for me to only work on weekends, would I do it? Of course, I would."
I'm broke.
"Thankfully, the drive-thru was open 24/7."
Turn left at the first light.
It's not easy for me.

Weigh your words well.
I have an allergy to milk.
It's only an estimate.
Tom is busy.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
May I present this to you in token of my appreciation?
It's more interesting to travel alone than in a group.
Tom called a taxi for me.
He really likes science fiction novels a lot.
Is that why you called me here?

It's pretty hot this morning.
"Whichever you choose, you cannot lose."
He is a frank person and easy to talk to.
Let's make a night of it.

We missed our train by a minute.
He studied the flight of birds.
She went out to buy some food.
May I hold your hand?
He turned to his friends for help.
I run every morning.
Tell me why you're doing that.
Do your feet still hurt?
I drank too much coffee today.
We still have many other things to discuss.

Tom hates French.
What's your name? I asked.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
It's getting warmer and warmer.
Call Tom.
She achieved great success in her business.
I wonder whether Tom was really at school today.
She wept with emotion.
There was no choice but to sit and wait.
I'm not at all satisfied with the results.
I don't have the energy to do that.
Let's not talk about Tom.
Tom entered the password.
The train has arrived.
I'm a junior high school student.
My pen isn't as good as yours.
He is always with me.
She told me she did that already.
I forgot.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.

"That's true, too."
You don't need to speak so loud.
I considered changing my job.
I have got to go now.
Where are my reading glasses?
We were supposed to leave Boston that night.
That's not a complete sentence.
Tom reads slowly.
Tom got mad.
The baby has been crying for a long time.
Is this mine?
I haven't read your letter yet.
"In 1939, as in 1914, the world was on the brink of war."
You might meet him.
How about you come with me?
Why is Tom always so grouchy?
Our working environment was good.
This is my favorite outfit.
"As soon as we get the tickets, we'll send them to you."
"You're planning on going again tomorrow, aren't you?"
Tom didn't look so busy.
Whose is this book?
Why won't you give me money?
I don't remember doing that.
My name's Tom.
"I'd like three twenties, six fives, and the rest in ones."

I was late for the appointment.
I was disappointed with the result.
Can you find out if Tom speaks French?
I feel sick every morning.
The leaders assembled in Paris for a meeting.
I've locked the front door.
There's nothing more important to me than my family.
I haven't seen anything of her lately.
I have my own thoughts on that subject.
We can do nothing about it.
I want to be a pilot when I grow up.
When will Tom get back?
My mother is now crazy about tennis.
Tom was attacked by a dog.
My father is a man of few words.
Tom was hit by a truck.
"Which do you like better, tea or coffee?"
I don't have anything to do this afternoon.

He decided to write in his diary every day.
Thank you for the delicious coffee.

That time was really fun.
I love watching basketball.
She is teaching us French.

Dial 110 at once.
Is Tom still in love with Mary?
That apple was delicious.
I wish that you'd told me the truth then.
I keep a good supply of stamps to save trips to the post office.
Do you really think that Tom will do that?
What'll we do if someone sees us?
Tom waited until 2:30.
A man's worth lies not in what he has but in what he is.
Your behavior brought disgrace on our family.
Tom is three years younger than Mary.
It looks like snow.
I don't understand this sentence.
I like Japanese food.
I think Tom has to go to the bathroom.
It isn't going to happen.

I'm hungry.
My battery is almost dead.
Tom slept like a log last night.

I envy you.
"Oh, the electricity has gone off."
Tom has written over thirty books.
This is the original.
Tom is extremely fussy.
Don't open your book.
Tom always says funny things to make me laugh.
That's a good idea!
It has way too many calories.
Is Tom doing okay?
Tom isn't here.
Tom likes to show off.
He will be pleased to help you.
The loss amounts to ten million dollars.
Some of the students were late for school.
There's nothing as precious as love.
Can you tell me your address?
How many books do you have?
He was absent from school because of illness.

He was absent from school because he was sick.
He said that he had met her on the previous day.
Is it OK if I go out for a walk?
The person I met yesterday was Tom.
I was nearly run over by a car.
He is very eager to go there.
That's not a very good example.
"I was sick, so I didn't go to school."
"He's somewhat hard of hearing, so please speak louder."
He was ashamed of his tears.
It's already 7:00.
The curtain fell.
There are books and notebooks on the desk.
She weighs 120 pounds.
This house is not new.
We talked till after eleven o'clock.
We'd better not stay up too late tonight.
I was in such a hurry that I forgot to lock the door.
Tom is sleeping on the sofa.
The tiles are shiny.
Why did Tom leave Boston?
A string on my guitar broke.
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school.
"Have some tea, won't you?"
Do you like white chocolate?
I just checked.
Almost everyone I know has a bicycle.
Tom is a terrible liar.
Tom is much taller than Mary.
It was nice and warm inside the house.
Does your stomach hurt?
I like going to places that I haven't been to before.
The two brothers are very much alike.
I have been to the station to see her off.
"No matter how cold it is outside, the rooms are comfortably heated."
"Me, too."
That sounds pretty stupid.
I'm drinking with my friends.
Are you sure that's what Tom was doing?
I'm planning to stay at my uncle's place.
Did you see yesterday's total lunar eclipse?
She gave birth to a healthy baby.
He is quick to take offense.
That kind of thing can't be found just anywhere.
The situation got out of their control.
It's obvious that that's a lie.
Please don't make me go with Tom.
He's employed on the farm.
I don't know for certain when he will come.
Tom is now studying in the library.
I heard that Tom kissed Mary.
Tom took off his coat and hung it in the closet.
Somebody might've overheard your conversation with Tom.
I've been down with a cold.
Haven't you read that book?
I'm going to the restroom.
Mom baked a Christmas cake.
Was it cold yesterday?
I remember meeting that man before.
I could hardly keep from laughing.
I don't know if he knows it.
I've missed you.
He wishes he had studied harder when he was young.
We are a family of four.
We're closed every Monday and the third Sunday of every month.
Are you finished yet?
I must have lost my purse in the supermarket.
Please keep this secret.
Are you interested in that girl?
I'll explain the incident.
Let's get down to business.
Men are physically stronger than women.
Have you finished writing your composition?
That story had a happy ending.
My grandfather died in the Second World War.
I am convinced that my son is innocent.
I'm not alone.
Are you going anywhere this summer?
I don't think so.
My daughter's adult teeth are coming in.
"If it hadn't been for your raincoat, I would've been soaked to the skin."
I don't like sports much.
More than 40 percent of students go on to university.
I don't think Tom will swim tomorrow.
It's evident that you told a lie.
I was off duty at the time.
I think it's unlikely that Tom would be interested in buying your old MP3 player.
I can't tell you.
When are you leaving for Boston?
This is too dangerous.
My mother is certain to say no.
Their wedding is tomorrow.
She is a runner.
You should shower.
We must take good care of ourselves.
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.
I just got here.
What are you doing now?
He turned pale with fear.
Why didn't Tom go to Australia?
He stood out because he was wearing a suit.
"You may go to the party, but you must be home by midnight."
I felt left out.
I make a point of being punctual.
"My husband earns $100,000 a year."
Which group is your friend in?
You'd better go right away.
"Tom is a pretty cool guy, isn't he?"
I want you to go there.
It's warm today.
Excuse me. May I use your bathroom?
I like this store.
This is probably a real diamond.
Please take a seat.
I've never heard you talk like that.
I don't like that store.
When did you start playing golf?
My father's hair has become streaked with gray.
I had a hard time trying to persuade him to cancel the trip.
Didn't you see the musical?
Look at the sports car over there.
My mother is cooking breakfast.
It's my favorite song.
I had a light supper.
I ate too much yesterday.
This photograph reminds me of my childhood.
I'm scared to talk to Tom.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
I know that Mary loves me.
I can't believe that Tom made that kind of mistake.
You shouldn't play with matches.
We know.
I've had a lot of calls today.
How would you translate this sentence into French?
He is an able engineer.
It might take a little while.
Are you stuck?
Are there any girls here that you haven't yet met?
What was the weather like yesterday?
Tom can't remember exactly what he was supposed to do.
"After the rain, there were puddles on the road."
This train stops at every station.
Do you want to play hide and seek?
I saw a dog swim across the river.
It's not easy to believe.
I thought that you were my best friend.
My bike needs repairing.
He promised not to smoke.
I go to the library from time to time.
Answer the following questions in French.
Stop showing off.
Let's go for a walk.
I don't think I'm cut out for city life.
He's not at all afraid of snakes.
Cats can see in the dark.
It's really cold today.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
"To be a good batter, you've got to hang loose and follow your instincts."
Have you seen my camera?
Tom seemed to like that.
I checked it twice.
I'm busy.
I've lost my credit card.
Tom grew up in an isolated village deep in the mountains.
I want to see the manager.
I love flowers.
It's not good to stay up late at night.
I usually have a ham and cheese sandwich for lunch.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
There is a public telephone on that corner.
My knee hurts a lot.
I am concerned for her safety.
Tom is a cheapskate.
Bring your children with you.
Tom's pulse is fast.
Don't fail to come here by the appointed time.
Your efforts will pay off one day.
I'm writing a letter.
I don't know how to say this in French.
I opened the door and went out.
I thought that went well.
They greeted me with a smile.
Tom had a gun.
Are you cool with that?
Do you need a lift?
"You've never had a boyfriend, have you?"
Tom isn't mistaken.
Tom is grinning.
I can't sleep at all.
I bathe every day.
Tom is frequently absent from school.
This is my favorite subject.
Do you really need to go out in this kind of weather?
I have absolutely nothing to do with that.
You'd better not go out.
I didn't know Tom was still working here.
Don't you have a television?
I'm an engineer.

I think Tom is still home.
Don't call the police.
It's nice of you to see me off.

I was given a new jacket.
I'd like to pay in cash.
The whole world craves peace.
Do you have a big family?
Tom doesn't know anything about it.
He lacks motivation.
I think you'd better sit down.
How many children do you have?
What're you doing in my house?
That sort of thing can happen when you're in a hurry.
You're always disagreeing with your boss.
Why are you running?
Have you ever eaten at that restaurant?
Where'd you get it?
He could always tell which direction the wind was blowing.
Can you wait a bit?
We really thank you for your patronage.
Call me sometime.
She has traveled all over the globe.
Come on.

She handed him his jacket.
That's a serious problem.

Which one is Tom's?
"When you finish reading this letter, burn it."
Where does Tom plan on staying in Boston?
He suggested we should start at once.
Did you receive my letter?
Who's watching TV?
I dreamt about you.
He never keeps his word.
I told you I don't know how to do that.
I took on the job of proofreading.
Where did you put the corkscrew?
I would like you to sing a song.
I wish I was dead.
The third house from the corner is Tom's.
We need more medical care for infants.
Call home!

Do you mind if I turn off the light?
Why didn't you tell me?
It's hot today.
A fallen rock barred his way.
She asked me who had arrived first.
Please open your eyes.

Tom looks a little nervous.
How would you like your eggs?
How should I know?
I don't have a guitar.
Both my parents are at home now.
Who do you think wrote that graffiti on the wall?
There's always somebody there.
"That job wasn't very interesting. However, the pay was good."
Tom is appearing on TV tonight.
The car parked in front of Tom's house was blue.
I wonder why Tom is so fat.
Who's the best French speaker in your family?
Tom ordered a beer.
I paid him the money.
I have something to tell you.
The ground is still wet.
My mother boiled ten eggs.
Let me see your ticket.
There isn't much money in this business.
What I mean is this.
That was a smart move.
Are you doing well?
I think this is a great system.
I don't want to go outside this afternoon.
Both Tom and Mary aren't very good at cooking.
Tom crossed the street.
I'm not afraid.
It's a big house.
Tom said that Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
You know it's a lie.
It was such a hot day that we went swimming.
A cold beer would hit the spot!
How come you didn't come to the party?
Not every man can be happy.
I don't think it'll stop raining.
Tom's wife's a friend of mine.
Don't grow up to be like me.
I got my shoes wet.

"When I was a child, I'd visit my grandparents several times a month."
I didn't expect that answer.
I stayed home all day instead of going to work.
Tom was blind.
"Tom, don't interrupt."
I'm expecting a customer today.
This book sold well in Japan.
I saw a zebra at the zoo.
"A bottle of rosé, please."
Could you please pass me the salt?
Today you can eat as much as you want.
I am not acquainted with him.
No one knows his name.
It's raining very hard.
I have a lot of pictures.
I can't stand this noise anymore.
Are you planning on staying in Boston for a long time?
Let's clean our room.
Is French easy to learn?
You shouldn't keep towels and cleaning rags together.
How much do you think this sweater cost?
"I avoid traveling by air, if I can help it."
Can I borrow you for just a minute?
Tom likes to write poems.
She is happiest when she is at home.
There were three men.
See you tomorrow.
Tom was standing just in front of a large building that was up for sale.
Everything Tom predicted came true.
Do you have a fever?
Do I have to come home now?
I've been bitten.
I waited an hour.
I guess you can't do that.
I call him Tom.
I went for a walk with my son.
I'm sorry to hear that your father passed away.
Please wait at home.
I want to hug you.
Do you know where the scissors that were here are?
Falling rocks present a danger to climbers.
The bus just left.
He doesn't have any idea how important this meeting is.
I thought I had a day off.
Tom owes you an apology.
What's the time?
"Today, we had an evacuation drill at school."
He bought the land with the plan to build a house on it.
Don't take chances.
Tom asked several people the same question.
Tom doesn't know squat about Mary.
I want to be friends with you.
Do you have a lot of guns?
Please be here by two-thirty.
Tom is waiting for someone to come pick him up.
"You're planning to go again tomorrow, aren't you?"
I would not part with it for the whole world.
"If dinner isn't ready by seven, I'm going to a restaurant."
I'll ask him if he will come.
I work at an information counter at the airport.
I can't put it off any longer.
We'll be getting married in October.
"In this day and age, anything's possible."
The vacation is close to an end.
Please give me the same thing.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.
Lindbergh's solo nonstop transatlantic flight was a remarkable accomplishment.
How many onions did you put in the stew?
What are you doing there?
The room was silent.
He is a bad driver.
There are oak trees in this forest.
I'm shy.
She has a strong personality.
I hate dogs.
"I told you not to call me Tom, didn't I?"
She acted the part of a fairy.
Only two people survived the earthquake.
Don't forget to take an umbrella.
I was born in America.
Why don't we go home?
I just wanted to let you know I'll be late tomorrow morning.
Look at the blackboard.
Tom is a poet.
I am disappointed that my friend is not here.
This car was made in Japan.
A parrot can mimic a person's voice.
That cheese is made from sheep's milk.
This word is not in common use.
Why did you buy flowers?
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.
"Tom, I found the picture you were looking for."
I approve.
Tom took a seat next to Mary.
"We waited for Tom at the library for thirty minutes, but he never showed up."
It was after midnight when we arrived.
You don't have to use such a harsh tone with me.
No student of mine would do such a thing.
Why does Tom always wear sunglasses?
I thought it was something like that.
I think that Tom likes you.
Who's with Tom?
You both did well.
I'm not sure how much they are expecting me to donate.
Please write with a pen.
I don't want to stay here.
"Drunk in moderation, alcohol isn't harmful."
What's missing?
It'll soon be sunset.
Don't walk under ladders.
But I wasn't afraid.
What does that mean?
I won the first prize.
I know the girl over there quite well.
What's in your pockets?
Tom peeled the apple.
There wasn't much news in last night's newspaper.
The problem is whether my parents will agree or not.
I am not afraid.
The price includes the consumption tax.
May I use the phone?
I heard it from someone.
What time do you usually turn in?
What time does the next train going to Tokyo leave?
Three hundred and fifteen pink rabbits marched along the highway.
Tom ate up all the cookies.
"We'll go to Hong Kong first, and then we'll go to Singapore."
What do you mean?
I'd like to thank everyone for their support.
It is a short drive to the park.
What time do you think he'll be back?
This box is too heavy for me to carry.
Write down your name here.
Drop by my office any time.
I was looking for you.
I'm nothing but a poor peasant.
Tom knew where I was.
This milk tastes sour.
"You've never been in love, have you?"
Let's begin with that question.
Have you been here before?
I'll call you up around eight this evening.
I wrote a letter to my parents at home.
I'm a little dizzy.
Tom sits at his computer eight hours a day.
I agree with you completely.
Do you often come here?
Tom tied the string to the kite.
I don't think he has anything to do with the matter.
You're drinking out of my cup.
I got her a doll.
He's Japanese by birth.
You're not yet old enough to drive.
We've got a cat.
I can't dance.
It isn't easy to get rid of a bad habit.
Are you acquainted with the man?
Tom is a member of a study group.
We have thirty-two teeth.
I hear that his father is abroad.
Both Tom and Mary relaxed.
"Tom looked everywhere for Mary, but couldn't find her."
You may or may not win.
There's no wind today.
Set a thief to catch a thief.
I have no time to engage in gossip.
Say it again.
"He was making a speech, but he abruptly stopped speaking when he heard a strange noise."
I'd like to try.
My wife and I both grew up in Boston.
Who's that?
He is used to walking long distances.
"It is rather cold again today, but tomorrow we expect the temperature to rise."
Don't say that.
Tom swore that he didn't tell anybody our secret.
Put this in your pocket.
He is a strange person.
The pain went away because I took the pills.
Tom turned up the TV.
Do I have to change my diet?
I passed by your house about 10 last night.
That's not important to me.
What's your favorite saying?
A fire broke out inside the movie theater.
Make it quick.
That's Tom's.
Get out of my way.
It's said that Tokyo is a very safe city.
Tom wants to become a simultaneous interpreter.
They invited me to play cards.
It's my brother's.
A monster was believed to live in the cave.
It's raining really hard right now.
Does Tom have a license?
That didn't really happen.
Most of the people here can speak French.
Look for it online.
I met Tom last summer.
Many would envy you.
Profit is better than fame.
That guy is always asking his parents for money.
"Please write down your name, address, and phone number here."
Why are you so dressed up? Where are you going?
Nobody can see this movie without being moved.
Fear often exaggerates danger.
This box contains five apples.
"Please, tell me."
This is an urgent matter.
"The door was locked, so I couldn't open it."
Tom is my father-in-law.
"Your name and flight number, please?"
I remember meeting you somewhere.
Take only what you need.
I'm a TV addict.
Are you related?
This is the first time I've driven a car.
Do you have matches?
Put it there.
Tom didn't like Mary.
Thank you for your purchase.
The shirt you gave me fits perfectly.
Are there many animals in the zoo?
He laid down the gun.
The fact is that they don't have enough money.
"Life isn't fair, is it?"
I'm going to meet Mary this afternoon.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
I forgot to bring my umbrella with me.
The red dress made her stand out.
Tom didn't want to bother Mary while she was studying.
She fell from the tree.
This shampoo comes with a nice hair brush.
Who said yes?
It isn't raining yet.
A button came off when I was playing baseball.
I'm going to buy a dog tomorrow.
We've run out of cheese.
"If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay home."
I'll be at your place in an hour.
When will his new novel be published?
I want him to leave.
My parents said that I was too young to do that.
We're beyond the point where just apologizing is enough.
I work out.
You can get it at a bookstore.
I'd like to have Tom over for dinner.
"Help yourself, please."
Have you ever had sushi?
We had a lively party last night.
How many cigarettes do you smoke every day?
All the boys are the same age.
Is there any chance that Tom will get arrested?
That is a table.
It wasn't Tom who did that.
We found it hard to change the plan.
I'm feeling nervous.
That's the way the ball bounces.
I don't have a hundred dollars.
I'll do the work tomorrow.
He's three years older than I am.
He is an unsung hero.
The ring couldn't be found anywhere.
This table has a smooth surface.
Do you really think Tom can win?
Half of the bananas in the basket were rotten.
The party went on for three hours.
I don't want an apology. I want an explanation.
I want more.
A day has twenty-four hours.
You'll find domestic articles on the third floor.
The kids are playing outside.
I'd rather stay home this weekend.
I'm very happy now.
I turned off my phone.
Were you crying?
I heard an interesting rumor.
I haven't had my breakfast yet.
Avoid sugary drinks.
What do you think?
Mary wore a pale blue dress.
He doesn't study as hard as he used to.
"According to the paper, there was a big fire in Boston."
That no longer matters.
I really enjoyed yesterday.
Let's go to a movie.
I hope your mother gets well soon.
She accompanied her friend to the concert.
There was a steady increase in population.
Tokyo is a very big city.
Can I try doing that again?
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.
That's not altogether bad.
I don't want to burden you with my troubles.
Your French is really good. Where did you study?
That's exactly what he said.
"I love this town, especially in the spring."
I asked where to go.
I'm off beer.
We look forward to seeing you again.
"When I got home, my mother and father were fighting."
"While there is life, there is hope."
Where are the toilets?
Mary wore her favorite necklace.
Why is everyone speaking so quietly?
Can I stay the night?
What would you do if you were in my place?
The room was cleaned by Tom.
Thanks for rescuing me.
"If it snows on the mountain, it's cold in the valley."
I often travel.
I was quite shocked by this.
I am thankful for my friends.
I wrote a letter.
I don't like math very much.
I prefer tea to coffee.
Thanks for the cookies.
Who coaches the team?
Is Tom still at home?
Open the window.
Please don't waste electricity.
When will his new novel be published?
Tom is a bully.
When did you get back?
Tom shut the door and locked it.
I have a card up my sleeve.
Tom thinks volleyball is more fun than basketball.
I understand what you're trying to say.
"It was hot today, wasn't it?"
He looks like his mother.
Has he come yet?
"Having met him before, I recognized him at once."
Tom isn't as fat as Mary.
Tom was on good terms with Mary.
Is that Tom?
What have you been up to recently?
Were you able to find the book?
Do you like Parmesan cheese on spaghetti?
Put on your pants.
Tom and I walked to school together.
Tom speaks three languages.
Our town has excellent sports facilities.
When was the last time you had your hair cut?
What is your name?
I've wanted to meet him for a long time.
I left around 2:30.
That's enough for today.
I like hot springs off the beaten track.
I need a couple of empty cardboard boxes.
No way!
You can do whatever you want to.
Emojis were first introduced in 1999 by Japanese artist Shigetaka Kurita.
I don't think that Tom is a billionaire.
Put out the light.
Excuse me. Where's the library?
Have a good time.
Elephants are herbivores.
I have some idea of what happened.
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
Here is a blanket.
It's just two miles to the town.
The floor was covered with dust.
Illness prevented her from taking a trip.
War broke out in 1941.
This room is very warm.
He went on talking as though nothing had happened.
Tom will succeed for sure.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
What's the difference between this and that?
Is there a nonstop flight to Boston?
This doll costs only sixty cents.
Do you see anything?
I bought a six-pack of beer on my way home from work.
Tom married Mary.
Where is the toilet?
I'd like to take a small trip this weekend.
Tom is out now.
Is there snow on top of the mountain?
Is Tom complaining?
"Where have you been? ""I've been to the dentist."""
I have a date tonight with an old girlfriend.
It was hard to resist the impulse to wring Tom's neck.
I'll be here.
These are too hot.
Are you finished?
I think this is amazing.
Would you join me for a walk?
I don't think that Tom is the killer.
Ask me something easier.
"Last year, I spent so much time by myself that I almost forgot how to communicate effectively with others."
I can't do two things at a time.
Does everybody have a pencil?
"If the weather is nice, I'll go out tomorrow."
It can't be true.
Tom was jealous of Mary's success.
My father died four years ago.
Is there really nothing left?
I'll try to fix it.
Why are you all still awake?
I love her.
I respect my teacher very much.
My father visited my uncle in the hospital.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
I spent three months compiling this data.
I'm not sleepy yet.
"Apparently, the murder happened in a locked room."
Tom considers himself good-looking.
I regret not having taken his advice.
Are you OK? You look like you're about to cry.
I think that my French is pretty good.
I'd like to play tennis with you some day.
Nobody's died.
"You write very neatly, don't you?"
He didn't give me anything to eat.
I'll give you one last chance.
It'll rain tomorrow.
She kicked him.
How long did Tom work here?
Tom is sleeping on the couch.
I beg your pardon?
I think Tom is a really nice guy.
This button is loose.
The man suddenly started shooting his gun.
The price of eggs is going up.
Tom didn't want to hurt anybody.
No one knows the reason.
Is this bike Tom's?
I need to leave a bit early.
It's quite old.
Does this hurt?
You must learn English whether you like it or not.
Someone is coming.
Tom's translations aren't very good.
I'll probably get there in the afternoon.
I would like to meet him.
I wonder whether or not Tom is able to understand French.
Excuse me.
We have a test tomorrow.
Thanks for the wonderful meal.
I told her once and for all that I would not go shopping with her.
I accepted the offer after due consideration.
I know why he did it.
Have you ever seen a koala?
The man passed by without so much as glancing at her.
I was having a bath when the telephone rang.
Where did you pick up your French?
We went down the river in a small boat.
They sent for the doctor.
Tom grabbed Mary by the hair.
I'll show you the way to the station.
Stop harassing us.
I heard the sound of a ringing bell.
Why are you still here?
You don't have to be an artist to find the beauty in everyday life.
"Could I use your dictionary? ""Of course."""
We weren't invited to the party.
He almost never gets angry.
What did you do today?
Someone stole my jacket.
I like the flavor of mushrooms.
I've eaten.
I'll do this.
Can I sit here?
I go to a driving school.
Tom says he wants to learn how to fly an airplane.
It's really horrible.
We'll have little snow this winter.
Why did you decide to become a teacher?
How beautiful she is!
I wish I hadn't bought so much.
There's an orange on the table.
I'd like you to tell me the truth.
I'll let you know beforehand.
I've got to be careful.
Turn the radio up a little.
I keep a diary in English.
The house was very badly built.
Tom borrowed some money from Mary.
Our dog was nearly run over by a car.
I want Mary.
I'm not sure when I'll be back.
My mobile phone is broken.
"All of a sudden, the lights went out."
Tom took a bite out of the apple.
This book is Tom's.
He seated himself beside her.
The boy grew up to be a famous musician.
He pointed to the tower over there.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
Tom has to have surgery.
Tom has gone away.
"He donated $10,000 to the refugee fund."
That's an original idea.
I set up motion sensors.
I'll be watching you.
I'm very sleepy now.
I haven't had lunch yet.
I never thought it would be like this.
I got wet.
It was not my mistake.
I knew that Tom was standing behind the curtain.
This is the house which was designed by a famous architect.
Jump across.
I'm not sure when Tom will get back.
Come early tomorrow.
People usually don't like what they can't understand.
Don't work too hard!
I hope that it doesn't rain tomorrow.
Tom tends to exaggerate.
Are you still in Australia?
I must've caught a cold.
Explaining the risks is very important.
It's next to that building.
Tom should tell Mary what to buy.
"At last, he realized his mistakes."
Never bite the hand that feeds you.
I really like staying home.
What do you do for a living?
My grandfather usually eats breakfast at six.
Tom turned the lights on.
We all like cycling.
Do you like talking?
We're programmers.
You can't take pictures in the theater without permission.
I'm still at work.
Tom is intelligent.
"If it were me, I wouldn't do that."
When's the lunch break?
Have you run into some kind of trouble?
Tom couldn't figure out where the money came from.
Have you ever eaten anything that Tom's cooked?
Do you want milk and sugar?
Tom is supposed to be here by now.
My mother is on a banana diet.
He was robbed of all his money.
I need a shave.
The two teams competed in the final game.
Tom doesn't like changing for P.E.
"I'm busy, so I can't go."
I still owe my brother the ten dollars that he lent me last week.
"If I'd known you were sick, I would've visited you in the hospital."
Tom has been dating Mary for at least six months.
I seldom go to Boston.
Tom is going to write a letter.
I fell asleep reading a book.
My older brother made all the preparations for us.
Why haven't you done that yet?
Don't spend your money on stupid things.
This house has triple-pane windows.
I've been wanting to go there for a while.
I don't want to attend the party.
"Why aren't you going? ""Because I don't want to."""
I'm afraid I cannot make myself understood in English.
She sat next to him and listened quietly.
This is a Japanese camera.
The taxi will be here soon.
I'm going to get divorced.
You've never asked me about it.
I've known that a long time.
Tom ran at full speed.
He said he wanted to go to bed.
All of us should go.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
I'm a teacher.
Let's get down to work.
Writing a love letter isn't easy.
I'm OK.
It has become much warmer.
Tom wanted his own room.
Tom doesn't have enough experience to operate a train.
We've got plenty of time.
How is the weather today?
Tom showed his room to me.
It's a very common name.
I met Tom's parents.
"If you want a ticket, please raise your hand."
Tom barely studied for the exam.
Please return to your seat.
The wind is blowing east.
Which hospital are you in?
I'm not always home on Sundays.
I didn't do that yesterday because I had a bad headache.
I thought that I asked you to clean the living room.
There is no TV in my room.
I don't know what you mean.
Tom tried to save Mary's life.
I'm dying for frozen yogurt.
Never be this late again.
Is this really a shortcut?
"I wanted Tom to stay longer, but he had to leave."
That's awfully convenient.
Where's the nearest pharmacy?
What do you think of that?
He brought his speech to an end.
Do you go to an elementary school?
Do you have your own room?
The boy was silent.
Has he failed again?
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
It was time for a change.
The Supreme Court overturned a previous decision.
Driving for one and a half hours to get to work is a bear.
Have you ever argued with your parents?
Is that your room?
I lost my glasses.
This work is difficult for us.
Let me introduce myself.
The road turns left there.
Tom grabbed Mary by the throat and started choking her.
You have too many books on that shelf.
Please clear the way.
Which one is Tom's?
What does the other party want?
Nobody's expecting us to win.
I've decided to do that by myself.
Why do you think so?
"It was more expensive than I thought it would be, but it was really delicious."
A lot of villagers were killed by soldiers.
I want to eat something healthy.
I hardly ever walk to work.
I want something to read on the train.
This has nothing to do with you.
Were you speeding?
Nobody says anything.
"She tried to get a tent at the shop, but she could not find the one she wanted."
Wait right there.
He has lost his job.
I want to own my own shop.
I would like to talk with you about this matter.
A new school building is under construction.
Let me know when you are leaving. We can go together.
"There was an earthquake and, in addition, there was a tsunami."
I love cucumber salad.
The dog follows me wherever I go.
He was sitting on a bench with his eyes closed.
Is this the first time that you've been here?
I didn't notice Tom had gone.
Can you give me a lift to the station?
Tom and Mary said they wanted to find an apartment close to where they work.
Tom wasn't able to find Mary.
I have a severe pain here.
Can you swim as fast as he can?
Everybody is waiting for you.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Tom lost.
We often went skiing in the winter.
Please send it by special delivery.
He ran away at the sight of a policeman.
The law doesn't apply to this case.
I don't think that he will come.
It took us three hours to come to a conclusion.
When was this tree planted?
My guess is that it will be fine tomorrow.
You don't have to work on Sundays.
I think she'll help me.
She translated it word for word.
I paid $200 in taxes.
"Last summer, I worked part time on a farm."
I often read books.
Could you give me a better price?
I'd like to live in a warmer climate.
That doesn't concern you.
It's easy to get lost.
It was because of the storm that the trains were halted.
Tom lives here alone.
I don't know where I should go.
I've never smoked before.
Is this going to take long?
I remember that place.
Haven't you eaten lunch?
I'm glad that I was able to help.
"As soon as she opened the door, a white dog ran out of the house."
Tom is kind to everybody.
He has a good reputation.
Let me help.
Won't you come with me?
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
Most of my friends are already married.
It seems to me that we should go now.
Tom made a birdhouse.
The chicken was delicious.
"As it is, prices are going up every week."
I went home in order to change my clothes.
At least you didn't hurt yourself.
I'd like to become a better person.
Tom got along well with Mary.
This is the school where my father used to go.
Put your masks on.
We like playing in the mud.
Why is no one eating?
There are many words with meanings I don't know.
I managed to get out of the crowd.
"On weekdays, there are always fewer people."
"We tried several things, but nothing worked."
Don't be noisy in this room.
"I want to have a part-time job, too."
"Once in a while, we should take a step back and think."
The general feeling is that it's wrong.
"Mom, that hairstyle makes you look old."
She asked after my parents' health when I met her the other day.
What a strange guy!
She watched the children swimming in the pool.
Do you know when his plane is arriving?
I thought this building had a sprinkler system.
It's already ten o'clock. My mother must be angry.
He's a high school student.
"With car prices so high, now is the worst time to buy."
A storm is brewing.
We depend on you.
"As a kid, I could sleep anywhere."
Let's have pizza for lunch today.
I commute to work by bicycle.
I know that Tom is a control freak.
I've given up smoking.
This coffee is too strong for me.
I agree with your opinion.
What was Tom's last name?
Iceland used to belong to Denmark.
I thought this was just a story for children.
I had to wait for over three hours.
The summer vacation ended all too soon.
"Let's buy Tom a car for his graduation present. ""That's a great idea."""
I'll contact you later.
Tom is shorter than Mary is.
How old are you?
Tom is an interpreter.
He returned back home after being away for ten months.
How did it come about?
"May I see a menu, please?"
"As soon as the bell rang, the teacher came into the classroom."
It began to snow.
"You're working part-time, aren't you?"
I'm not mad at you.
I called Tom.
I like watching movies.
What's your friend's name?
Are you all right?
You can't build buildings on swampy land.
The baby doesn't walk yet.
Is it just me or does he look a bit like Obama?
Please tell Tom that I'm going to be a few minutes late.
I want to live in a warmer place.
Either day is OK.
We all couldn't believe it.
I like pie.
I've not seen him in a long time.
We can do it.
Don't you think I can win?
"If you want to ask a question, please raise your hand."
Studying when you're sleepy is a waste of time.
I like your voice.
Mary is beautiful.
I need a corkscrew.
I understand your position perfectly.
You should study harder.
She's not talkative.
What are you doing right now?
I'll never tell you.
I thought Tom was joking.
I'll go to school tomorrow.
I want a new hat.
I've caught the flu.
I'm counting on you.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
I had nothing to lose.
Winter is right around the corner.
The front of the bus wasn't crowded.
Stop talking when the teacher comes in.
I'll buy a watch for my son.
Will you go on a trip?
The main valve is turned off.
I didn't hear anything.
What good will that do?
I'm glad that you'll come.
"Hearing him speak English, one would take him for an Englishman."
That hut is crawling with lizards and insects.
"I got cold, so I put on my coat."
I still have the sweater you gave me when I was thirteen years old.
Tom is the man of my dreams.
Tom wanted to learn French.
Tom is nodding his head.
I felt a burning sensation all over.

It's not easy.
This sweater is warm.
He has been to the station to see his friend off.
You should've told me in advance.
"I can't read French, let alone speak it."
Don't catch a cold.
How about giving me a promotion from just-a-friend to boyfriend?
Please don't stare at me like that.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
Tom wouldn't do something like that.
There's no telling who'll be sent in his place.
I think we'd better talk to Tom.
"I haven't seen the movie, nor do I want to."
I'm sorry that I woke you up.
This is the first time that I've parked my car in the woods.
I hurt my shoulder.
I don't want to be late for class on the first day.
Tom ate my apple.
Why's this so cheap?
Tom is off to a rocky start.
Drive safely.
Pigs are very intelligent.
I was able to catch the last train.
Dad bought me a camera.
Choose any one from among these.
Smoking is bad for your health.
I couldn't eat fish when I was a child.
I can't stand listening to loud music.
Do you speak French at home?
Spread your fingers.
I want to buy this material for a new dress. How much does it cost?
What did you put there?
He was more or less drunk.
Tom is a man's name.
The work was all but finished.
The rocket was launched into space.
I thought I heard voices.
"When can we eat, I wonder."
He gave a loud cry for help.
The secret of success in life is known only to those who have not succeeded.
My cat died yesterday.
I'll put some coffee on.
Were you blindfolded?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom tried to say something to Mary.
I can't stand this hot weather.
She is aggressive.
Are you still mad?
The heater is broken.
What's the accusation against him?
I'm going to sleep in about an hour.
Who do you think you are?
I'll get you a bicycle for your birthday.
It makes no difference to me what the color of your skin is.
He put all his heart and soul into it.
I have a dull ache here.
She has beautiful handwriting.
Will you go on a picnic with me?
You should take an umbrella.
I take a bath every day.
"Yes, I want to know, too."
Go on.
"Certain poisons, properly used, are useful."
Tom has no manners.
My younger brother and I live in the same apartment.
"Everyone, please listen for a moment."
The ship sank to the bottom of the sea.
I attached my signature to the document.
I don't think Tom will be successful.
I hope we'll be able to keep in touch.
Are you Japanese?
"If you're not careful, someone will get hurt."
I'll ask my brother to give me a ride.
Is this the first time that you've been here?
I found it easy when I gave it a try.
This wine is very expensive.
He seems not to have known it.
Do you ever dream about flying through the sky?
Their pizza is really bad.
Don't tell Tom. I don't want to worry him.
Tom is about three years old.
The station is pretty far.
I didn't expect it to cost so much.
The tide is coming in.
Tom says he can stay here two or three nights.
Please don't worry.
Please turn off your mobile phones.
I didn't recognize him at first.
I'll see you later.
Many high school students hang around at book stores reading comics.
"Can you spell ""Massachusetts""?"
The TV program seemed very interesting.
Tom was arrested for driving while drunk.
Get your mother to do your homework!
I had coffee.
They would never meet again.
The exit will be on the left.
I think this is the best way.
Have you read all of it?
His real name's Tom.
I don't understand your question.
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
I'm not confident.
Do you have glaucoma?
"I had met the girl before, so I recognized her immediately."
He had a big smile on his face.
Don't exceed the speed limit.
All the houses in town were empty.
I usually get up at 8.
Tokyo is more populous than any other city in Japan.
Mary came up to me when she saw me.
He hasn't actually been to America.
I can hardly understand what you are saying.
I wonder if it'll rain tomorrow.
Tom has become rich.
"When cleaning the classroom, a few students carry the podium."
It looks like Tom doesn't know how to put a saddle on a horse.
I didn't have anything to drink.
She has buried her only son.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I would be happy to do so.
There's not enough light in this room for sewing.
Tom would love to see this.
The doctors told Tom that Mary would never recover.
Are you seriously thinking about becoming involved?
Is Tom still hanging around the office?
I quit.
"You had better not wear the red dress. ""Why not?"""
Tom is in his junior year in college.
This watch is a real bargain.
Come along with me.
It cost him five pounds to buy it back.
We chartered a bus.
This smells great! What are you cooking?
How's your business going?
You'll miss the train if you don't hurry.
"What was I going to say, again?"
Let's give it a whirl.
You had better go.
The crowd rushed to the exit.
Is there anywhere in Europe you'd like to visit?
I don't envy you.
Everyone has their own strong and weak points.
It's too dark to read in here.
I counted to two hundred.
"She has a lot of faults. Still, I like her."
Please call me up if you want me.
He resembles his father very much.
What do you think of these poems?
I'm free.
Air is leaking from the tire.
I got a pair of new shoes.
"When I've finished my homework, I'll go for a swim."
Is this the cup that Tom used?
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Tom is the one who caused the accident.
"At a rough estimate, I would say the job will take two weeks."
Which floor do you live on?
Do you know what he has done?
Don't look at me.
I slept very well.
There is very little hope of his success.
I'm reading a book about animals.
I haven't run the washing machine yet.
That wasn't wrong.
This is a family tradition.
We suspected him of lying.
We saw a white ship far away.
Don't rush things.
The tines of the fork were bent.
What time is it now?
Could I use your desk?
Did Tom talk to you about his plans for next weekend?
Write Tom.
Tom left his umbrella in Mary's car.
Tom is going to Boston tomorrow.
Raspberries are very expensive.
I must prepare their breakfast.
This is my old bicycle.
I walked along the river.
Is it OK to freeze cheese?
She killed an hour looking around the stores.
"I tried to open the door, but I couldn't since it was locked."
Why do you need a chainsaw?
There is a bridge about one kilometer up this river.
It's started raining again.
She warned the children against playing in the street.
I watched a movie.
I don't feel like eating supper tonight.
I hope you had a nice trip.
Let's meet at the station.
Birds fly south in the winter.
I will not see him any more.
Don't make a fool of me.
Follow me. I know the way.
"Roses are flowers, and pigeons are birds."
His letter makes me uneasy.
Moths are attracted by light.
"Every time I read this book, I find something new."
Tom chugged his beer.
I made the same mistake.
He read the book from cover to cover.
Tom is new.
The show's about to start.
The shop was crowded with young people.
I'll give my books to you.
When is the intermission?
Tom seems a little nervous.
I think Tom doesn't want to tell the truth.
A taxi is more expensive than a bus.
It's snowing outside.
Will it snow tonight?
I ate absolutely nothing the whole day.
I should've left earlier.
Are you excited?
I'd like to know what's happening here.
Any book will be OK as long as it's interesting.
I looked into the incident.
Are you a real doctor?
I don't like hospital food.
Tom is allergic to peanuts.
What're you working on?
No one noticed the picture was hung upside down.
"If you want this marriage to work, you need to choose between spending time with me and working all the time."
Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Wash your hands with soap.
We should try to comfort Tom.
I'm afraid to do it.
Let's do it at our own pace without hurrying.
Be kind to Tom.
The summer is over.
I was surprised Tom spoke French so well.
Will you write with a ballpoint pen?
I would never use emojis in business emails.
Tom was just as nervous as Mary.
"Starting next week, we'll be using a new textbook."
What'll you do today?
I asked her to make four copies of the letter.
I can't stay long today.
We have a lot of rain in June.
I'm sorry that I let you down.
He used to read a lot.
That's very big.
I thought that we said 2:30.
I want to dance with you today.
Get that book for me.
You are not a child any more.
"If walls could talk, what stories would they tell us?"
There have been a lot of complaints about that policy.
"When did you return? ""I came back the day before yesterday."""
We are playing tennis this weekend.
I already have a girlfriend.
I was teaching French.
Tom is unmarried.
May I come to see you one of these days?
My uncle came to see me.
Mary works part-time as a nurse.
Is Tom cool?
I'm tired.
The boys kept quiet.
I stole some apples from Tom's tree.
Have you ever smoked?
It was very difficult.
I take off my shoes when I go in my house.
My father is a bank clerk.
I'm absolutely sure!
Is what Tom told me true?
I need to know by tomorrow.
You've got to see her home.
Thanks for listening.
What happened?
My heart hurts.
"If you turn to the left, you'll see a white building."
Who is that man in the background of the picture?
Do you have any brothers?
The lake is deepest here.
He lost his parents in a plane accident.
He is free with his money.
He gave a vague answer.
I admit my mistake.
Kids learn quickly.
We can't meet your demands.
It took only ten minutes to walk there.
He ate out.
Tom can't whistle.
There's the teacher.
There used to be a coffee shop near the school.
I worked far into the night.
It is said that global warming is directly related to carbon dioxide emissions.
I think I made the right choice.
Tom loves cats.
Just put yourself in my shoes.
Can I be of any assistance to you?
It's about time you settled down for good.
There is a strong bond between the brothers.
It's freezing.
The police found my bicycle that had been stolen.
I drank milk.
He is said to have died here.
Tom was bewildered.
He glanced at his watch.
I'm exhausted.
Tom wants to be a simultaneous interpreter.
I will do my duty to the best of my ability.
My headache has gone.
Tell her which train to catch.
He and I are brothers.
His anger towards me has not softened.
Where is the nearest drugstore?
Should I watch my diet?
I like snowboarding.
"I never thought Tom would win. ""Me neither."""
What will you do after graduation?
I think that Tom would know the answer to that question.
What did you say?
Almost all of Tom's money goes to supporting his family.
Today is my treat.
Tom and Mary did their homework together after school.
It's a very common name.
I think I can do it this week.
"Sorry to be so direct, but how much did you pay for this?"
My kid is being potty trained.
A lot of people are killed in automobile accidents every year.
Tom went home alone.
I ran upstairs two steps at a time.
I'll see you later.
He promised me that he would come at four.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you something important."
Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.
Tom looked at them both.
Where's your school?
I saw the picture you took of that fish.
What do you call this insect in English?
They have no house to live in.
The station is just up ahead.
Our teacher seemed surprised.
Could you call Tom?
"I understand that you feel uneasy, but don't worry."
There is not much difference between the two.
"Daddy, may I go out and play?"
Tom fell asleep immediately.
How do you play hide-and-seek?
Tom rode his bicycle to school.
I don't want to read anything else.
Did you forget?
I am learning two foreign languages.
We woke up after midnight.
Why isn't there any food in the refrigerator?
Would you like some breakfast?
My father's house is larger than mine.
It looks like an apple.
I'm at home today.
"Which do you like better, apples or bananas?"
They invited me to play cards.
He said he'll help us.
I can't figure out how to upload an image.
I was very scared of snakes.
I'm not familiar with French poets.
We took a lot of photos on our trip.
He always keeps his promises.
"You're busy now, aren't you?"
My brother seems to enjoy himself at college.
It's nothing.
Please take a seat.
"No matter what happens, I'm not changing my mind."
Tom took his girlfriend out on Saturday night.
Tom may have been sick.
He started washing his car.
I'm a high school student.
Prices dropped suddenly.
My parents have just arrived at the station.
Will you please help me?
Are you really going to eat all that?
I am concerned for your health.
Where should I wait for you?
This is a megaphone.
How strange!
I'm giving Tom a new bicycle for his birthday.
Germany was once an ally of Italy.
Are my clothes dry yet?
I think Tom is from Australia.
I'm getting sleepy. How about you?
I am not about to pay ten dollars.
It's frozen solid.
I plan to go skiing with my girlfriend.
How's school?
I have a terrible toothache.
Tom had to go to the hospital.
Who came?
You should look over the contract before you sign it.
Where is Tom's classroom?
Be careful not to miss the train.
There is a man by the side of the pond.
The thief ran away.
Make sure to thaw the chicken before cooking.
Our house doesn't have a guest room.
I agree with his opinion.
There are many politicians who don't keep their promises.
How much is the car you are planning to buy?
Nice to meet you.
"As soon as the dog saw me, it began to bark."
My father doesn't let me drive a car.
I became very sleepy after a bit of reading.
I don't like math.
Did you catch the first train?
I want to show you something.
She pushed him off the pier.
"Tom doesn't have dimples, but his brother does."
"I'm really good at math, but my English is really bad."
No sooner had she caught sight of me than she started running in my direction.
I'll have to let you know.
This is a very rare specimen.
At least thirty students were absent.
Tom is nodding.
It isn't clear what the writer is trying to say.
He is very busy now.
Troops were swiftly called in to put down the riot.
I don't have a TV.
Where did my homework go?
She has received a good education.
How much is this watch?
He's a dramatist.
Does Tom still have your key?
Do you have any idea what the population of Tokyo is?
Tom likes fruit.
This meat is good.
I have only just arrived.
Fog has limited visibility to 100 meters.
I'm not a night person.
Let's do it when he comes.
That's my CD.
I don't know if I'm stupid or not.
Tom's girlfriend is really pretty.
He went on talking as though nothing had happened.
I was born in 1979.
Tom was supposed to meet me at 2:30.
This underwear needs to be washed.
Tokyo is one of the largest cities in the world.
Tom is a bit older than Mary.
I wonder if you're truly happy.
This is the best.
I forgot to close the curtains.
I'm such an idiot.
Why don't we eat pizza?
I'm glad that you found the money you lost.
She is not so much a singer as a comedian.
Thanks for waiting.
A person who makes an easy matter sound difficult does not seem to be so smart.
"Tom will be able to do that, too."
See you all later.
"I'm talking about this pen, not that one over there on the desk."
What is missing?
"Even though there was a no U-turn sign, I made a U-turn."
This is none of your business.
I don't like riding the subway.
How do you eat this?
It's already too late.
Tom said that you were in here.
Don't look at me that way.
Would you like to play tennis Saturday afternoon?
Is it possible to land a plane on this island?
Is it OK if I go out with Tom?
Where did you hear about us?
Helen Keller was deaf and blind.
We went camping in October.
Please call me at this number.
Sorry. I burnt it.
I'm likely to get home late tonight.
They are sensible girls.
The meeting ended at 4:00 p.m.
Tom isn't as rich as Mary is.
I lost my car key.
That's out of the question.
Have you ever eaten horse meat?
"If I had taken that plane, I would be dead now."
"As is often the case with teenagers, she's conceited."
The library is open from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
We were waiting for you.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
Click here to register.
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
"This cake contains flour, milk, eggs and sugar."
I spilled coffee on my shirt.
Was Tom in Boston last year?
I will never forget your kindness.
I have bad eyesight.
Tom and Mary like to sing.
Tom will be released from prison next month.
I've chipped a tooth.
"Hello, Tom. Good morning."
Who told you how to do that?
"How about a cup of coffee? ""I'd like to, but I have a previous engagement."""
"Let's go to the movies, shall we? ""Yes, let's."""
Do you know the guy living next door?
I have a red bicycle.
How did we win?
Don't buy a pig in a poke.
Tom was kind.
I converted the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius in my head.
Clean the room.
No one would say that.
I want to know how he manages to make such good use of his time.
I'll phone you later.
Everywhere you look you can see damage caused by the earthquake.
"Stratford-on-Avon, where Shakespeare was born, is visited by many tourists every year."
I didn't get much sleep last night.
What do you think of the new teacher?
Do you like school?
I admit that he is right.
Write your name and address on this envelope.
You may go.
She ironed his shirts.
We ran into each other at the station.
Where can I exchange money?
She had her husband drive the children to their homes.
Is it really recyclable?
Tom has been in the hospital for three months.
I ride my bike to work.
Keep the dog out.
Even a child can do such a thing.
My brother eats twice as much as I do.
A package has arrived.
He is accustomed to working hard.
It was after midnight.
Go back to your seat.
He is always late for school.
Tom gave me this for my birthday.
I think that my costume for the upcoming Halloween party will be wrapping myself up in toilet paper like a mummy.
What should we do if it rains?
I'll have to take over my father's business in the future.
Industrialization often goes hand in hand with pollution.
Could you please open the door?
It's windy today.
You look good in black.
I use French every day.
I'd be glad to go in your place.
He's a baseball player.
Your older brother is really angry.
Traffic is heavy on this street.
"No matter what you may say, I won't change my mind."
Tom is sitting alone in the waiting room.
It's really dark outside. I wonder if a storm is coming.
I'm planning to stay at home all day tomorrow.
I think that I've told you this before.
It'll be finished in a day or two.
I can't go to school today.
I don't understand what you mean.
Tom scraped his knee.
I like sandwiches.
This feels soft and smooth.
"Hey, who wants pizza?"
Don't knock it till you've tried it.
The weather is beautiful today.
Do you have a camera?
I don't know what you're doing now.
Mary is a nurse.
May I ask a question?
I usually do the dishes.
"Oh, I'm just going to take it easy."
I was absent from the party.
They are both working at the pet store.
My parents don't speak French.
She dumped him.
Tom became an architect.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
Speak louder so everybody can hear you.
I talk in my sleep very often.
"To register, click here."
Is Tom good at speaking French?
Tom looks depressed.
Let's ask Tom.
Please open the window if you want to.
Nobody knows.
Where's the bathroom?
I finally found out the truth yesterday.
She went to Italy to study music.
Someone's waiting for you outside.
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
I don't like speaking in public.
We're here to win.
I'm in the car.
My shoes are too small. I need new ones.
Dublin is located in Ireland.

"In that respect, I agree with you completely."
Do you have any food allergies?
There are many birds in this park.

I like her novel.
I was making a cake.
Sometimes it's better to remain silent.
I've ordered something to eat.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
I heard the door close.
That's impossible for me.
It was dark when I got to the hotel.
"You're the one who decided to do this job, right?"
Can't you drive a little more slowly?
I am sure that he is an honest man.
Who painted this painting?
Don't make noises when you eat soup.
There's a pencil on my desk that you can use.
We can't hire anyone new right now.
It was fun.
Tom saw Mary kissing John yesterday.
I think that Tom could do that.
I'm waiting for your letter.
I've given up my brother for dead.
I'm glad that Tom found his key.
Tom ate a quick lunch.
How much longer do I have to wait?
Do you know who he is?
It looks like Tom is about to cry.
Look both ways before you cross the street.
What kind of books did you buy?
This photo is the only one in which the entire family can be seen.
You should cancel your trip.
She squeezed the juice from many oranges.
"It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone."
Tom couldn't decide what book to read.
I rang the doorbell.
Tom stood in the rain for hours.
"When the tempura I make cools down, it immediately loses its crispiness and doesn't taste very good."
I stayed at a small hotel by the lake.
There's a book lying open on the desk.
"Excuse me, is there an ATM near here?"
Do you really believe in that stuff?
We had to wait a little while for a bus.
How's the job hunt?
Today is extremely hot.
He is generous to excess.

I'm a little hesitant about asking her for a favor.
Today is very warm.
Are you new?
You have to walk a long way to get there.
Let's go by bicycle.
He's unable to read.
Never tell a lie.
Come here immediately.
What happened? Your coat has blood on it.
Tom handed the picture to Mary.
I'm clean.
He got used to the work.
I forgot to put on sunscreen and got sunburned.
All but one were present.
"Mary is really clever, isn't she?"
Go help Tom.
Natural resources are not abundant in Japan.
He remained single all his life.
Is everyone ready?
Apples were served as the dessert.
Who told you about me?
Did you hear the thunder rumbling?
I wish I had a room of my own.
There were many people in the room.
He has no sense of direction.
Tom will do that sooner or later.
This is the last time.
It is dangerous for you to travel to a foreign country by yourself.
It's extremely cold today.
Have you found the solution to the problem?
He should have done it that way.

Shut the door behind you.
Next time phone ahead.

Do you know what this means?

Why did you quit?
He was laughed at by everybody.
We have no reason to lie.
I am thinking of going abroad.
How lovely!
Summer is over.
How much money did you spend in total?
I don't understand the meaning of this sentence.
"Tom told me Mary was good at playing the piano, but I didn't really believe him until I heard her play."
All the villagers went out into the hills to look for a missing cat.

"Fortunately, no one was hurt."
She will get well soon.
I'm afraid I can't make it at that time.
I think it's fine as it is.
"Sorry, I don't understand French."
My grandpa was born on Christmas Day.
French is easy to learn.
It seems that she was ill.
She is getting married this fall.
I think that it won't rain this afternoon.
Tom was very worried about you.
She closed her ears to what he was saying.
Take this medicine three times a day.
I continued reading the book.
Did something happen?
I'll be glad to.
I thought that both Tom and Mary were under thirty.
Tom wasn't able to do that by himself.
The museum is closing for restorations.
You're responsible for this accident.
Tom goes out drinking every evening.
He pretended not to be listening.
I'm extremely happy.
I wish that I'd called you.

What's the name of this tune?
I walked across the park.
It was Tom who kissed Mary yesterday.

Each of them has a bicycle.
"Oh, I'm so sorry."

Mary loses her temper easily.
It's so warm in this room that I'm sweating.
Tom shot a bear.
My shoes are bigger than yours.
How did you like the concert?
Tom said he thought that Mary was married.
Even a cheap frying pan will last a long time if used carefully.
He's a smart boy.
I'd better go look for him.

It was past midnight when we arrived.
Let's ask them.
Mary likes romantic comedies.
Tom isn't a good guy.
How can I gain weight?
Babies have delicate skin.
Tom burned all the letters Mary had sent him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Tom finally got a job.
Tom is shirtless.
My daughter is getting married in June.
That's a good idea.
Tom is sitting on a chair.
My father takes a walk every day.
We made an appeal for support.
"I'm willing to take care of your children, if you want me to."
What time do you get up on workdays?
My father plans to go overseas next week.
I could be wrong.
I don't know who he is.
She was only too glad to help us.
He will have to undergo an operation next week.
Haven't you eaten yet?
I have a migraine.
Have you been to Australia?
I like to feed the pigeons.
Why is everyone so concerned about this?
Perhaps Tom can win.
Your English has improved a lot.
I'm listening to a podcast.
My clothes got wet so I took them off.
It took me an hour to learn the poem by heart.
Tom said that he had been cleaning the house all day.
What time do Tom and Mary usually leave for work?
All I want is you.
Tom just wanted to be neighborly.
There was hardly anyone who didn't laugh when the singer fell off the stage.
Examinations interfere with the real purpose of education.
We're having some people over tonight.

The sun has not risen yet.
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
Accidents will happen.
I don't want to stay here tonight.
I can't eat any more.
"It's not that weird, is it?"
My back hurts.
Just look in the mirror.

You did your best.
I doubt Tom will get here on time.
We were both extremely lucky.
Are those two going out?
I would like to have some more water.
I wrote down her name so as not to forget it.
I don't know where to go.
I'm a friend of Tom's.

Please look for it.
We still have more time.
I don't see any problem.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
This coffee is too hot for me to drink.
She's a good photographer because she's so observant.
Can I be of any assistance to you?
She thought that I was the doctor.
I have a report that has to be submitted by tomorrow.
Tom always checks the caller ID before he answers the phone.

I think watching TV is a waste of time.
We have to face reality.
It was a huge success.

You'd better not go out in this bad weather.
Is the post office within walking distance from here?
Tom was limping.

Each speaker was allotted five minutes.
All you have to do is sweep the floor.

"We're going to do that today, right?"
She gave up smoking.
Are you surprised that I came?
"You know her name, don't you?"
Was the movie good?
Breathe through your mouth.
Don't make me laugh!
She didn't give me back my money.
There's enough time for a quick snack.
This puzzle is too hard for me.
Are you going to the post office today?
Don't tell Tom. He'll tell everyone.
Can I get a drink?
I can't thank you enough.
Tom is probably a little younger than me.
Was the work done by him alone?
"What should I do with this moldy bread? ""If it's moldy, throw it in the trash."""

I had a great time today.
Please find someone who speaks French.
I'm lonely without Tom.
Where exactly did you come from?
I run before breakfast every morning.

"Not knowing what to say, I kept silent."
She prayed for her son's return.
"What's 5,814 rounded to the nearest thousand?"
The house has a thatched roof.
There's nothing better than a beer after playing baseball.
I'll come again tomorrow if I can.

I fell in love with her the moment I met her.

How many hours a week do you teach?
Tom is out buying wood to build a doghouse.
I hope it'll be fine.
Tom is wearing a blue bandana on his head.
Is there anything I shouldn't eat?
I can't leave you behind.
You gave me a real surprise when you showed up there.
It's windy and it's raining.
He was alone.
My younger brother is watching TV.
Do you know how to use it?
He was hurt in the accident.
You're to blame for the failure.
Where's your house?
I must buy some milk.
How is your work coming along?
My father might be at home now.
It's not my fault.
He ran into debt.
I know him.
Her lack of money kept her from going with me.
I think Tom expects too much from us.
You are drunk!

You did an excellent job.
That dress looks good on you.
Your work is below average.
It matters very little what college you graduated from.
When did you come to Japan?
I am out of time.
This isn't my knife.
How did you spend your free time?
Don't get fat.
You brought this on yourself.
"Pass me the salt, please."
When does the movie start?
She says she has no intention of having a baby until she's in her thirties.
My grandmother really likes watching TV a lot.
We eat here every day.
Was that true?
I'm exhausted.
"I'm not sure what it was, but it sounded like a gunshot."
Come to my office any time.
There was broken glass on top of the wall.
"Not knowing what to do, I did nothing."
Everyone knows that.
Is Tom crying?
I'm tired.
That's the point.
I've never seen a pearl of such magnitude!
No one can match him in English.
Why would Tom lie?
Do you think this is funny?
Is it hot?
Hold it!
Did you turn off the stove?
I think we should reduce the price.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I had sore legs the next day.
"She's trusted by everyone, isn't she?"
The thief admitted his guilt.
We're not a bit too soon.
May I smoke?
I regretted having wasted a great deal of time.
He has any number of books.
Neither Tom nor Mary knows how to play the clarinet.
"This week, I'm busy."
It's not worth mentioning.
Is there any possibility that he'll win the election?
I'll arrive at the station at about 1:35.
Don't get your hopes up too much.
The storm has died down.
You're the only one who can help me.
I've always wanted to try scuba diving.
I don't think that we need to worry.
Tom told me his wife's name was Mary.
Thank you very much for your letter of January 7th.
What should I buy?
"Generally speaking, boys can run faster than girls."
It was really embarrassing.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
"Just to be on the safe side, why don't you take an umbrella with you?"
The coat is on the chair.
"Whenever I drink sake, I get a headache."
Vote for me!
My college has a dormitory.
Don't move unless I tell you.
How was the hotel you stayed at?
Do your homework by yourself.

I think that Tom is sympathetic.
Apes rank above dogs in intelligence.
Here are some pictures.
Can you give me your email address?
I feel good today.
He's living from hand to mouth.
Do the trains run on diesel oil?
This brings back memories.
May I open a can?
What's your profession?
I was aching to tell her the secret.

We're going to have a meeting here tomorrow.
He's eating lunch now.
I think it'll work.
Those knives are really sharp.
The bus was delayed an hour by the accident.
You're not normal.
I went to work by car.
Tom can't tie his shoes by himself.
Where in Austria did you grow up?
I am going to buy a new car.
I have heard the story.
Some students don't like wearing uniforms.
I wanted Tom to buy some eggs for me.
Don't forget to fasten your seatbelt.
I ran to the station so I wouldn't miss my train.
"If not now, then when?"
My hands are sticky.
A lot more people died in Second World War than in First World War.
I will never see him again.
Does the price include breakfast?
How much did you pay for those shoes?
My goldfish died.
I've never been this happy before.
He looks strong.
I planned to do that by myself.
The petals are floating on the water.
I plan to major in cognitive science in college.
The room was so noisy that Tom covered his ears.
I wonder where Tom parked his car.
I had a cup of coffee at the cafe.
Why are you so mad?
I found it difficult to get along with my neighbor.
Don't be ridiculous.
Does your arm hurt?
Tom lives at home with his mother.
I guess there was some talk of that.
No one knows what happened then.
I don't care about that.
What should I do?
Phone me if you change your mind.
"If you were me, what would you do?"
I'd like you to be my partner.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
It is no exaggeration to say that he is a genius.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Tom looks like he's about to cry.
Don't speak French to me.
This is taller than any other tree.
The notes are at the bottom of the page.
Tom's bag was badly damaged.
The pocket edition is cheaper.
I often travel.
It's possible.
You'd better not go there again.
History is repeating itself.
I rang the bell and waited.
My grandfather likes to walk.
My index finger hurts.
The library is located in the middle of the city.
How long have you lived in Japan?
Where do they sell stamps?
Let's go for a drive in my car.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Go to the end of the line.
It's dangerous to walk around here at night.
I don't think Tom will like this place.
"Generally speaking, Japanese are hard workers."
She wants him.
I've run short of money.
He adhered to the original plan.
I vowed that I would never speak to Tom again.
Are all the doors locked?
I translated the letter into French for Tom.
Playing basketball is fun.
It's impossible for me to finish my term paper by tomorrow.
The wind has abated.
I haven't bought any furniture yet.
I don't know what's got into her.
That's a question I often get asked.
"If you have time, why don't you drop by his gallery?"
Don't leave the window open.
How many rings do you own?
That's easy to explain.
I'm surprised to see you here.
We have to call the police.
I know Tom isn't as tall as Mary is.
I'll call you back.
I thought that you'd finished that already.
There is a dictionary on the desk.
It happened in the blink of an eye.
Are your parents still living in Boston?
A bird is singing in the tree.
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
There were a number of men eating their lunches under the trees in front of the library.
He is a bit on the heavy side.
I don't remember what happened.
I don't quite understand what you are saying.
I can't buy a book this expensive.
The cat went through a gap in the fence.
A rustling sound came from upstairs where nobody should've been.
He looks pale.
I was ill at ease because I didn't speak French.
Tom is too old to play games.
Is this really a non-alcoholic beer?
My dog ran away.
I'd like to improve my French.
I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
He lost himself in his new research.
I talk a lot.
Please take me to this address.
The eggplant was delicious.
Tom ignored Mary.
I'm glad I could meet you today.
I told Tom I didn't know anybody named Mary.
This room's too small. We need a larger one.
She was choked with tears and was unable to speak.
Tom's laughing.
He can pull strings for you.
My father is a teacher.
It's very obvious Tom likes Mary.
Have you ever baked a pizza?
Where did you buy those socks?
He was groggy from too much wine.
Thanks for listening to me.
Tom probably won.
We have thirty employees.
Tom bought flowers for his mother.
Is Tom still working here?
Tom shut his notebook.
Her beauty cast a spell over him.
Get me up at eight.
Are you sleepy?
I found it under your bed.
Tom thinks we can do it.
They made up their minds to go by car in spite of bad weather.
Tom put off his wedding because of a traffic accident.
How can I get to the station?

You have made many mistakes.
Did something happen?
He is said to have something to do with the political scandal.
They adopted the little girl.
The children are sleeping. Please don't be so noisy.
How did you get to know that person?
I turned right.
For real?
Stars were twinkling in the night sky.
I didn't think that Tom would still be mad.
Won't you have some tea?
A hundred years is called a century.
What are you talking about?
They admired the fine view from the hill.
It depends on how strong it is.
There is a television in this room.
Tom is a brat.
I'm concerned about Tom.
"Come on, get up."
Should I clean your windshield?
Where are you staying?
"Apart from the weather, it was a good picnic."
We did this.
The curry was nothing special.
I want to sleep a little longer.
"You haven't washed your hands yet, have you?"
How much money does a teacher make?
This morning I got up later than usual.
You can have it for nothing.
They look exhausted.
She hit him with a hammer.
He proofread my manuscript.
Let's only speak French.
The ground seems wet.

Tom is being very polite today.
Is Tom really living in Boston?

I bathe once a day.
What're you talking about?
Are you still not feeling well?
Half of the apples are rotten.
Can I open this box?
Wait one second.
The temperature is going up.
We must allow for some delay.
Are they new?
What are you learning?
"I'm sorry, I don't have change."
We're sophomores.
"Once the complaining starts, it never ends."
Please call me.
Tom is probably still in his room.
I'd like to buy some earplugs.
I said so.
I'm busy this week.
What did you do when those men attacked you?
What does your father do?
The car's windshield was smashed to pieces.

It was inevitable that they would meet.
I'm just happy to be here with you.

What did you have for lunch today?
A toothache deprived me of sleep.
I'd prefer not to do that until after 2:30.
We expected better terms.
My back is killing me.
Would you teach me how to make cheese?
I want to make a person-to person call to 212-836-1725.
Do you have a vacancy?
"It's tomorrow that you're leaving, isn't it?"
I shouldn't have told you anything.
That's a stupid question.

The clouds are getting darker and darker and it's beginning to look like it might rain.
Keep your eyes open.
There's a meeting going on in the next room.
This browser is fast and easy to use.
Don't forget to open the window in your room.

How is it going?
Stop talking.
Are all of you homeless?
I don't like cucumbers.
That's news to me.
Keep it in a cool place.
I'm very sorry for being late.
Why's Tom so angry?

Timing is important.
I don't want to eat anything today.
We can see many stars tonight.
None of them are mine.

The answers are all right.
Do you watch television?
I do not have a cat.
This door is locked from the inside.
This book is hers.
This is a car magazine.
Tom has a natural talent.
I deleted a lot of photos by accident.
That wouldn't be my recommendation.
"Even though they were poor, they were happy."
Are you going to play tennis this week?
It's going to take a lot of time to clean up this mess.

I'm 30.
Everybody has the right to seek happiness.
Never bite the hand that feeds you.
How's this translation?
It is very hot in the summer in Japan.
Have you applied for a passport yet?
I have something I want to give you.
The dog was dead.
No one can tell what'll happen in the future.

I hope everything goes well.
I owe him 100 yen.
See you.

I heard you were sick.
Tom carried two boxes into the storage room.
Ten years is a long time to wait.
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
I was the first in line.
Tears rolled down her cheeks.
I don't feel comfortable here.

Don't you smell something unusual?
I seldom go to art museums.
May I open the curtains?

All of the students stood up together.
She doesn't seem to be an American.
Are you Japanese?
It was pretty hard to do.
Don't close the door.
I unfolded the map on the desk.
The water coming from the faucet is strange. It has a good smell.

Maybe Tom likes someone else.
Can you hide me from the police?
My five year old daughter always goes to kindergarten happy and full of energy.
French is Tom's mother tongue.

How would you like to come and spend a week with us next year?
It's been raining for about a week.
Tom ate.
Did the umbrella that you found belong to Tom?
I could swim well when I was a child.
Tom called a cab for Mary.
I get what I want.
Is there any rice left?
You have only to do as you were told.
It's news to me.
You don't have to eat.
I lent my younger brother some money.
"Give me a glass of water, please."
This box is very heavy.
These shoes are not suitable for running.
That hotel is not all it's cracked up to be.
Don't keep the car in the barn.
Tom and I still aren't ready.
The crowd yelled when he scored a goal.
My grandfather on my mother's side is celebrating his 60th birthday tomorrow.
The door was closed.
He's always busy.
I'm glad you weren't hurt.
I think that we're too late.
This is a good place to build sand castles.
What kind of food do you usually eat?
I grew up in this neighborhood.

There is almost no water in this bottle.
It's awfully hot this summer.
How do you remove red wine stains from your carpet?
Say hello to your sister for me.
Please endorse this check.

I know why Tom is in trouble.
The chocolate Tom is eating was given to him by his girlfriend.
He fell asleep immediately.
Is this a local train?
You had better go to the dentist's.
Is there any other way besides extraction?
It's no use arguing about it.
I don't like bad children.
Are koalas bears?
What did Tom drop?
Whale sharks eat plankton.
I was convinced that he was guilty.
He turned traitor.
Tom has never been late for school.
He pretended to be a doctor.
All you need to do is to write your name and address here.
How long will you be here?
Let's get a closer look.

I will hit the sack.
I never drink beer.
Who is the girl in the pink dress?
I grow rice.
I think I'm really not so good at French.
You should do that right now.
"Some people like baseball, others like soccer."
That's why I told you not to go by car.
He looks like a clever boy.
I retired last year.
This isn't soluble in water.
Tom isn't as strong as before.
Could you hang up the laundry?
My house is on Park Street.
I don't eat junk food.
I'm an apprentice.
Let's hide in here.
This is a condition caused by aging.
How come girls are usually easier to talk to than guys?
I didn't expect that Mary would come so soon.
"Upon hearing the news, she broke down crying."
"She's smarter than Mary, but not as beautiful."
The root of the problem is a lack of communication between departments.
Would you mind turning down the volume?
I tried standing on my head.
Everyone is unique.
That isn't a big problem.
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
I forgot the key and went back for it.

"I paid 40,000 yen for this tape recorder."
I want something cold to drink now.
My father goes jogging every morning.
I'm no longer afraid.
"Besides Tom, who should I meet?"
I've seen them somewhere before.
I really like that singer.
Please wrap it.
Tom was quite handsome when he was young.
I woke up very hungry.
What kind of wine do you recommend?
I know Tom is a control freak.
I'm going to go to the movies.
The cold north wind was roaring outside.
Tom and I played chess all afternoon.
"You remember what happened, don't you?"
"Put on a coat. If you don't, you'll catch a cold."
That money's mine.
There are several solutions.
I didn't work yesterday.
At least I'm still alive.
He's not a very meticulous guy.
Shouldn't we go back now?
Tom pushed Mary into the pool.
I make it a rule to jog early in the morning.

Get a hold of yourself.
This coat is too short on me.
"You must be tired after a long day. ""No, not in the least."""
Isn't it about time you went to bed?
She stayed there for a moment.
They advised me to go to the police station.
I climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
How long do you plan to stay here?
Tom is probably a little heavier than I am.
Stop harassing me.
Tom lit his cigarette.
That's a splendid idea.
The color is a little too dark.
This does not apply to students.
What more could I want?
I drink three cups of coffee every day.
Anyone can do it easily.
May I sleep outside?
This is the latest acquisition to my library.
Tom is always bad-mouthing others.
I think Tom was right.
Why don't you go and see for yourself?
There are some people who think it's a bad idea.
I decided to change my image.
All the newspapers reported it.
Earthquakes may occur at any moment.

"Sir, you have left your lighter on the table."
"Mommy, may I go swimming?"
Do you remember when Tom and Mary came here for the first time?
An old friend of mine dropped in on me for the first time in ages.
"This is my little sister, Mary."
Do you have any others?
Tom always finds fault with her.
Tom told me where to buy what I needed.
I'm doubtful whether Tom will come.
She never dreamed that she could win first prize.
Tom has been shot in the head.
Tom and I went to the same high school. He was a year behind me.
The baby can't walk yet.
I haven't seen anything like that.
"If you don't take a break once in a while, you'll get sick."
She just left.
You didn't need to do that.
We met at a party.
Try to be as polite as you can when asking directions.
We've already had lunch.
"I bought a camera for 30,000 yen."
Tom groaned in pain.
I know how to ski.
Tom is a good judge of character.
You'll miss the train if you don't hurry.
You don't have to go to school today.

"Keep it secret, please."
My father died of cancer.
Tom can't live without a TV.
Tom wouldn't do such a thing.
Call me when you get settled in.

We're the same age.
No one wants to listen to my opinions.
Hand me the soap.
Where did Tom see Mary?
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
What's the next stop?
Is Tom still aboard?
The baby was naked.
I have a lot of work to finish up before the end of the week.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
I'll do that job.
Who's the person with Tom?
She woke him up.
"Your business is flourishing, I hear."
I don't want to be too hard on Tom.
Tom isn't an adult yet.
Who was the book written by?
Your breath smells.
Add a little more pepper.
You should continue until you're satisfied.
My sister is three years older than I am.
A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched the two of them with sleepy eyes.
"No matter what, don't tell Tom."
The child was almost drowned.
Will we make the train?
The tourist bus crossed the border.
Thanks for your help.
I'd like to go abroad someday.
We need to buy dog food.
The sisters are both blondes.
Your diet is going to be really unbalanced if all you eat is hamburgers.
They sent me a sample in answer to my request.
Tom is taking a shower.
May I ask you a few questions?
I'd love to hang out with you this weekend.
I was asked to put away all the papers we used at the meeting.
I want some ice cream.
I'm very unhappy about this.
Don't forget to wash your hands.
I talk fast.
Turn the light off.
You should ask Tom.
Is there an ATM around here?
Hurry up. It's late.
"If possible, I'd like to go by plane."
I think it isn't possible for us to make up for lost time.
Let me do my work in peace.
Tom is used to cooking on a campfire.
You'd better ask the doctor for advice.
Why am I doing this?
I have lost my camera.
We often play cards on Sunday.
He assumed the leadership of the political party.
Have you finished dinner?
I'd like to live in New York.
What do you really think of Tom?
Is this too big?
"In case it rains, I won't go."
You drive.
Tom and Mary both laughed.
I want a chair.
Why don't you rest a bit?
Sit down and take it easy for a while.
Please tell me how to cook sukiyaki.
Five more minutes! Please wait five more minutes!
Come back.
Did you buy these books?
Is Tom still in Boston?
There's more ways than one to kill a cat.
It's not clear what the writer is trying to say.

We had a blast.
What are you guys talking about?
Tom would like to live in the country.
Tom and Mary carried the injured man to the side of the road.
"I have free time tomorrow, so I'm going hang out with my friends."

A ring and some cash are missing.
Is it true that short people need more sleep than tall people?
I bought her a nice Christmas present.
Tom is waiting for us in the park.
They have solved the problem once and for all.
Do you want me to comb your hair?
There were too many people there.
Tom asked somebody else to do it.
Don't open the door till the train stops.
Could I see your driver's license?
I need to try something else.
I want to go now.
Yesterday a truck hit this wall.
Will you look after our pets while we're away?
Show me the money.
Be sure to turn off the light when you leave the room.
Do you ever get told you look like someone else?
Three ships were given to him by the queen.
I've read it.
This is the reason I disagree with you.
There weren't any customers so we closed shop early.
Do your own work.
No one complained about that.
It was a good trip.
I want to go with you.
You've got a bright future.
When did Tom come back?
There's a problem there that you don't see.
Please give me a little more time.
I spent the whole morning writing letters.
"Tom, have you eaten anything?"
That book is small.
That's too bad.
I miss you.
I'll stay home if it rains tomorrow.
Did something happen?
He really likes traveling a lot.
He began to indulge in drinking after he lost his wife.
How tall is Mt. Fuji?
"Tom can speak a little French, but he isn't fluent."
Are you interested in art?
That toy is made of wood.
He lives on this street.
I'd prefer to get a male dog.
Tom said that he'd do that tomorrow.
I have never been abroad.
"Alcohol is cheap in Germany, too."
Tom is filthy rich.
Your mother will get well soon.
Don't tell anybody.
I am a member of the baseball team.
Is there something you'd like to tell me?
Where're the shoes?
Tom was too tired to speak.
Where is the toothpaste?
I'll be there right away.
Where shall we go?
There is little hope of his recovery.
Did you visit the Tokyo Tower?
I studied hard so that I could pass the examination.
I don't have a favorite tie.
He stutters.
"If there's something that you don't understand, please don't hesitate to contact us."
The police blamed the accident on the taxi driver.
I'll do it myself.
I will play tennis this afternoon.
I thought that you wanted Tom to marry you.
Tom went missing in Australia.
Everybody has weaknesses.
Who closed the gate?
I spent my summer vacation at my grandmother's place.
You need to go on a diet.
Is there anything I can do to help you?
My friend's father is a doctor.
The patient is delirious.
Who is this girl?
I think that Tom is insensitive.
Tom is waiting for you.
I refuse to obey you any longer.
What's your favorite kind of art?
You have no right to ask me such questions.
He went off in a hurry.
I don't have an older sister.
The park was empty.
How about going for a walk?
The building is twenty stories high.
I bought a red tie.
Everything is fine so far.
Put it in the top dresser drawer.
I'll visit Tom next week.
"These are cheap, aren't they?"
We must win at any cost.
Did you see the rainbow?
I didn't really feel like going out.
We get at least three customers in our shop every day.
He had an accident at work.
"He stayed in his hotel most of the next day, talking to friends and supporters."
I know the real reason for his absence.
Come along.
Don't scare me like that!
How long did you wait?
That color doesn't look good on me.
Is it worth the effort?
Did you really expect him to tell you the truth?
Look at me when I talk to you!
We saw Tom at the zoo.
The school has no library.
The door remained closed.
It's already eleven.
Look out for cars when you cross the road.
He went to see her the other day.
I couldn't get the tickets yesterday.
Do you remember that baffling murder case?
Today is the twentieth.
Put it back where you found it.
I never see this picture without thinking of my father.
I overslept and was late for school.
"Being tired, I went to bed early."
The door was left ajar.
Tom was in a hurry so he left his bed unmade.
You aren't yourself today.
We can see many stars tonight.
This toy car runs on batteries.
I want something new.
"Tom, which do you think is better?"
Ah is an interjection.
How are you related?
He caught sight of a ship in the distance.
I saw Liz this morning.
Call me back.
You don't need to go.
Do you have a minute?
"I have five copies, but I need twice as many."
Do you think Tom is lying?
Tom isn't sick.
There is no limit to human desire.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will agree to go or not.
We are cousins.
"Some juice, please."
I look forward to corresponding with you.
He turned down my offer.
"Just then, the professor came in."
The problem is who's going to tell Tom the truth.
May I ask a stupid question?
The population of Tokyo is greater than that of London.
"It's a lot, but it's not enough."
A bunch of people thrust their way toward the rear exit.
I want a boat.
Tom is only interested in football.
This bread is really delicious. Where did you buy it?
The stream isn't very swift.
I didn't want my mother and father to worry.
I took the kids to the zoo.
I like eating seafood.
I forgot to say goodbye to Tom.
You can't live on that island.
He often makes people angry.
What did you do last night?
I don't recognize it.
I'd like orange juice.
My plan was adopted by them.
I heard a woman scream.
I don't even know where to start.
My sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
I'm proud of my son.
I didn't want anyone to know what was in my heart.
My mother's in the kitchen.
I've been to Boston many times.
There are many interesting people in the world.
No taxi stopped.
He seems to be very happy.
Tom is still cleaning up.
I hate studying.
"The floor is slippery, so be careful."
You put way too much pepper in it.
Get dressed.
Here is the book you are looking for.
Don't forget to buy bread on the way back.
I have nothing particular to do.
May I ask you something?
Is Tom handsome?
What did I ever do to you?
We have many rainy days in June.
You look relaxed.
Tom just announced he'd be moving to Boston.
Do you know what PKO stands for?
I have two sons.
Don't stay up late every night.
I'm sorry to bother you.
None of the students arrived on time.
I don't think that I can get you to understand how difficult that is.
Tom doesn't like parsley.
Come and join us.
Don't bother me.
I would like something to read.
I am not as interested in literature as you.
What do you think of this plan?
That word isn't in the dictionary.
It's just started raining.
Was Tom the one who taught you how to dance?
Let me think for a while.
I wonder what happened.
Children were playing in the schoolyard.
He shuddered at the terrible scene.
"If I had left a little earlier, I would have caught the last train."
I have little time to read.
Some flowers bloom in spring and others in autumn.
I can't remember his explanation.
"A man's body dies, but his soul is immortal."
I can't bear the noise any longer.
The new tax system comes into effect next year.
Tom got the children to laugh.
Tom is one of my roommates.
Get up at seven tomorrow morning.
I'll come here again tomorrow.
I find it difficult to believe.
You ought to do that right away.
He is every inch a gentleman.
Cats usually hate dogs.
"It's really expensive, isn't it?"
I loved studying French when I was in junior high school.
Tom really likes chocolate cake.
Can I borrow your car?
"The sun set, so they quit work."
Tom said that he'll do it tomorrow.
Did anybody call you?
"You saw what Tom did, didn't you?"
This book isn't worth reading.
Nothing happened.
The day will soon come when man can travel to Mars.
"I can't find Tom. He hasn't already gone and left, has he?"
He succeeded on his second try.
This cup is Tom's.
It's rained a lot this month.
This job isn't difficult.
They told us to sit here.
What do you plan to major in in college?
Those approaching retirement age have the choice of working or not working.
Don't run down the stairs so noisily.
I made the train.
I doubt if he will come.
"If necessary, I'll come at nine tomorrow."
Tom is my younger sister's husband.
I'm dying to know what's in Tom's suitcase.
Is it OK if I sit here?
I should've come earlier.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Tom was suspended from school.
"Because he was sick, Tom wasn't able to take the test."
Tom wasn't able to swim.
Who wrote that book?
Could you show me a camera that's cheaper than this one?
I don't know how old Tom is.
Can you really swim?
These things aren't mine!
He couldn't accept a strange woman as his mother.
Do you catch colds often?
I can see he is ill by his appearance.
Tom looked fine.
It became quiet again in the forest.
Do you know why the sky is blue?
I must learn French.
I don't like him because he is sly as a fox.
I thought you'd already gone home.
That is why he got angry.
I can hear you just fine.
There was a light rain yesterday.
What prevented you from working?
Don't always take sides with him.
May I use your phone?
I'm twelve.
Mary is cooking breakfast.
I know Tom says he doesn't like me.
I thought I told you to stay in the car.
My eyes hurt.
How long does it take to get to the station?
Please pull over.
That will do.
There is a bank in front of the hotel.
I know that you're in here.
Let's try one.
I wonder why Tom went and did something like that.
I'm looking for my glasses.
You should memorize as many English words as possible.
Tom is too old for this.
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Perhaps I can help you.
Raise your hand if you understand it.
I just want to read the news.
What's the difference between cabbage and lettuce?
"Tom hasn't been drinking, so he can drive us home."
I hurried to the station only to find that the train had already left.
We're going to have a storm.
"You've changed, Tom."
Can you do something about it?
What did you eat for lunch yesterday?
He was so poor that he could not buy the bread.
I have life insurance.
Tom tore the picture into pieces.
Tom was stabbed in the back.
"If I'd been with you, I could've helped you."
Shall we play golf this afternoon?
I wish you could have seen him pitch.
It's raining today. Where is my umbrella?
Who is the boy swimming in the river?
Perhaps it's true.
Gold is expensive.
Some medicine does us harm.
My doubts have been cleared up.
"Are you sure, Tom?"
Tom said that he wanted to get divorced.
Was the play interesting?
You're father is a very friendly person.
Will you sign it for me?
She'll make a good wife.
Would you please autograph this book?
It'll rain soon.
"I spent 3,000 yen on a new CD."
Was there a book on the desk a moment ago?
Mary cut her finger.
Tom doesn't often speak French.
A broken-down car was standing in the middle of the road.
There are lots of eggs in that box.
He'll become a good husband.
Last night's earthquake was very strong.
It's not so muggy today.
Do you commute to school by bus?
I watched the 4th season of X-files.
I'll look into it.
It's two o'clock in the afternoon.
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose?
Where was the wedding held?
How are you? Did you have a good trip?
I didn't know what to say to him.
"I'm a teacher, not a student."
Why don't you want to come with us?
There is no reason for you to feel inferior to anyone.
Such a proposal would only be turned down immediately.
You should've called.
I wanted a brother.
Smoking is bad for your health.
I didn't like Tom at first.
"What's important is not the goal, but the journey."
"Let's not talk shop, OK?"
Tom was tickled pink.
Tom used the floor jack.
I trust him.
Parents are responsible for their children's education.
It's the only one there is in the shop.
You work too much.
Is this OK?
We really enjoyed our meal.
I can't help making fun of him.
Tom had nothing to eat.
I love trips.
All three of you are very lucky.
"The average of 7, 10, and 16 is 11."
Read as many books as possible.
I don't know why Tom didn't tell the truth.
I went to bed at twelve last night.
I'm very sorry to have troubled you.
"Are you a vegetarian? ""No. Are you?"""
"Tom is young, but he's not innocent."
How did that happen?
I hope they can reach a peaceful compromise.
I exercise every day.
Is dinner ready?
Let's wait until Tom comes back.
Are you guys busy?
How can you tell an Englishman from an American?
The prince was confined in the castle for three years.
Who said I didn't like Tom?
The temperature is above average this winter.
Where was he born?
Doing the laundry is my job.
I think that you'll be a good father.
Let me know as soon as anything happens.
Have you reserved a table?
He drives his own car.
Can you imagine what life would be like without television?
Who will look after the baby while they're out?
I couldn't find a parking space.
My father has just come home.
Which bed do you want to use?
Could you open the window?
I have learned the basics of the art of flower arrangement.
One must be patient with children.
Are you still with Tom?
He turned over in bed.
Where's the train station?
Tell us what you did in Tokyo.
Buddhism originated in India.
How is it going?
She's wearing sunglasses.
Yesterday Mary stayed home all day.
I didn't think I'd be so nervous.
The members decreased by 50 to 400.
Don't handle these tools roughly.
They're good people.
Swimming is good for your health.
Tell me where it is.
He exchanged yen for dollars.
Today I want to eat something light.
I want to stay here a few days.
Give me the ball.
You forgot to erase your name.
I need his help.
I want to be a better person.
That student was there.
"Sooner or later, we all are going to die."
What OS and browser do you use?
"Name and address, please."
Cockroaches are insects.
May I borrow this pen?
Tom is the only one that can do that.
I'll give you anything but this.
I met him.
I almost got hit by a truck.
Finding an apartment can be difficult.
I don't feel so hot today.
I wonder if Mary wants me to drive her home.
I want to think for myself.
I'm happy when I'm with you.
I parked my car next to yours.
There is some wind.
I'm putting on lipstick.
The medicine has to be taken every six hours.
The summit of the mountain is covered with fresh snow.
You think I don't know what's going on?
"Boy, that hamburger really hit the spot."
Do I have to do that now?

This might not have anything to do with our problem.
We won't have much snow this winter.

Tom is a good captain.
Tom hasn't got much money with him.
Are you losing weight?
I don't need it.
This song is catchy.
Is the coffee hot?
Do you believe in God?
The basket was full of strawberries.
Tom says that he speaks fluent French. Let's talk to him in only French to test that claim out.
I'm in charge of 30 students.
I have a nice golden fountain pen.
I've eaten nothing for the past three days.
Don't make noises when you eat soup.
Tom likes to spend time outdoors.
Is your new coat black or gray?
Charge this bill to me.
I watched a Canadian movie last night.

Shoot!
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Tom deceived you.
I had no idea it would end this way.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
I couldn't understand any of it.
Tom and Mary are probably younger than you think.
It may not be a dream.
Tom wanted to see Mary.
I forgot what it was about.
I was very tired today.
I like rhubarb tarts more than apricot tarts.
Let's get down to business.
Try as hard as you can.
He sang a medley of Simon and Garfunkel hits.
The capital of Poland is Warsaw.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't understand things well.
"You know that you need to do that, don't you?"
"Some like red wine, others like white wine."
"Get in here, Tom."
Every rule has its exceptions.
Please telephone him.
Tom can't read anything without glasses.
Are you still awake? It's bedtime!
Do you mean what you say?
I've lost my sense of smell.
Help me with shelling these eggs!
Please change this to dollars.
I was almost run over by a truck.
May I sit here?
"Mom, I'm sorry for always causing you trouble."
The one who uses this toothbrush isn't my mother.
"Sorry, but I can't hear you very well."
Is it OK if I stay in the car?
It seems to me that we should go now.
She has an eye for the beautiful.
I'll boil the potatoes for you.
"Mary is your daughter, isn't she?"
The grass is always greener on the other side.
This is much more delicious than what Tom usually makes.
I got a cramp in my leg while swimming.
He has been busy this week.
Please explain the procedure.
Hand me my mug.
Don't forget to close the door.
Tom is getting better.
Take care not to fall.
Jackson was not planning to retreat.
The two brothers couldn't get along with each other.
This room is too small for us.
Please call a taxi.
Your temperature's a little high.
Ask Mary if she can speak French.
Can you deliver this?
I thought Tom was Canadian.
Tom high-fived his friend.
Tom swims well.
I'll pick you up at noon.
It's been fine for a week.
Do you like Japanese food?
We didn't know what to do.
Is Tom really going to eat that?
I'll stay here if you really want me to.
They went on talking for hours.
I wasn't very tired.
What is your name?
That book is full of mistakes.
Does Tom gamble?
I'm jealous.
Do you work on Saturday?
This valve needs to be replaced.
I have some gifts.
Don't forget to put the fire out.
"Every morning, I go shopping."
How are you getting along in your new job?
Peace will come to us in time.
Aren't you able to speak French?
"A little more coffee, please."
Japanese is our mother tongue.
See to it that this never happens again.
French isn't spoken here.
I hate homework.
I hear that Tom is in the hospital now.
Stop spending money on stupid things.
The meeting began at nine o'clock sharp.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I'll take care of the bill.
Did you know this?
It's snowing outside.
I can't get rid of this cold.
Tom banged on Mary's door.
You can see the ocean on your right.
Are you going by train or by car?
The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.
Will you take care of my dog while I'm away?
It has cooled off.
I worked hard in order to support my family.
She elbowed her way onto the train.
Don't forget to take an umbrella in case it rains.
Something stinks here.
A drunk man fell down the stairs.
Tom is unsociable.
"Tom isn't really shy, is he?"
Soldiers guard the place around the clock.
I had my wallet stolen.
I just have to drop this book off.
You're doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing.
Don't take things too seriously.
"Good job, everyone."
I was late because I ran out of gas.
Why don't we order pizza?
You may go out as long as you come back soon.
Isn't Tom from Australia?
Stop complaining and do the work you were asked to do.
Somebody entered the room.
"Will you come here tomorrow, too?"
May I have a moment of your time?
Do your homework right now.
I won't be in Australia next month.
The exhibition is now open.
How long will this cold weather continue?
She looks like her mother.
My right shoulder hurts.
I have a lot of money.
Can I play some music?
I can't stop sneezing.
I haven't decided yet.
The roads are already covered with snow.
Mind your manners.
Tom and I talked about this three weeks ago.
I figure that my vote won't change anything.
"Our bus left at eight, arriving in Boston at eleven."
Everybody ran outside.
You're way too good for him.
Mary had a dream that she won the lottery.
How have you been recently?
Let Tom try again.
"Mary said that she loved me, but I didn't believe her."
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
Where do you want to go for your summer vacation this year?
Would you like white wine or red?
We defeated the other team by 3 points.
My boss doesn't think I'm equal to the job.
Tom will be here until noon.
A lot of people think I'm crazy.
Bad news travels quickly.
Why don't you enlighten us?
He's a good loser.
You can do it.
I have just finished my work.
I don't like either of the two clocks.
Don't be so reserved.
I'd like to play tennis.
This beer mug holds one pint.
Could we have a table in the corner?
I watched that old building being torn down.
He's a difficult person to deal with.
I like cold potato salad in the summertime.
Some people believe in ghosts.
I was offered a beer.
The audience looked bored.
Put your hand down.
He came to pick me up.
Tom has a loud voice.
He works as hard as any other student.
She called the students into the room.
My dad is busy.
I don't know how to spell the word.
Let's sit down.
I finally persuaded him to buy it.
I found the key underneath the mat.
We are high school students.
Is Tom a Christian?
Do you have a daughter?
He wrote the report.
This problem deserves considering.
Do you have any cough medicine?
That river is long.
I have to take a make up test in English next week.
"In case of an emergency, phone me at this number."
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
You will be able to sing better next time.
How about getting the special of the day?
I used to go to this church.
Tom stays up until after midnight almost every day.
Are you telling me you've never been to Boston?
He's studying.
He walked two miles in half an hour.
"What's important isn't which university you've graduated from, but what you learned while you were there."
It seems to be serious.
Everything's returning to normal.
Give me a copy of this book.
What's your favorite vegetable?
She looked for her bag here and there.
Let me have a look at it.
I should've tried to get along with my classmates better.
My season ticket expires on March 31st.
He accused us of wronging him.
Don't cry in public.
I burned my finger.
I have complete faith in Tom.
Are you listening to me?
How did you answer her?
I thought that you'd be at the bar.
Are you open for business on Sunday?
I think Tom won't come.
I had a nightmare last night.
I was watching TV when the telephone rang.
Where are the lions and tigers?
Can I see a menu?
I'd like your advice.
Do you see what I'm talking about?
You're selfish.
"Write with a pen, please."
I like white wine better than red.
I don't like such sports as tennis and golf.
"The next time you go to the supermarket, buy some toilet paper."
I'm still sleepy.
Won't you stay for tea?
Mary wanted to be a nurse.
"You don't have any plants or animals, right?"
This sort of music isn't my cup of tea.
Tom and Mary are both in their thirties.
Tom fell into the mud.
"Today was a good day, so I'll sleep soundly tonight."
Light travels much faster than sound.
Tom's my friend.
I have to stay at home.
Watch your head.
You've made the same mistake.
I've got a bit of an ache in my back.
I speak fast.
I need to cancel my reservation.
I gave some money to Tom.
I was planning on doing that by myself.
He's inclined to be lazy.
This is a Japanese doll.
I thought Mary loved me.
Tom is just my age.
He kindly answered the question.
He is a bus driver.
Please refrain from smoking in the elevator.
He runs to the station every morning.
Tom hasn't yet decided whether he'll go or not.
I have a lot to do this afternoon.
Tom cycles to work.
I'm fed up with her.
Have you ever tried scuba diving?
Sit down here and tell me all about it.
I bought the same camera as you have.
You'll have a rough time.
I just wanted you to be happy.
I don't know how to get to your place.
Please mail this letter for me.
I guess the time of reckoning has arrived at last.
Please tell me what to do next.
I need to get my teeth fixed.
Are you ready?
I'm grilling fish.
I want a chess set.
He sat in front of me.
I got my hair cut three days ago.
I think Tom is patient.
She's heating the water.
I'm scared of bats.
What did Tom bring?
I'll come back soon.
Taiwanese food isn't as spicy as Indian food.
I will be back soon.
Tom has tattoos all over his body.
I don't really like my job.
We won't make any progress with just the two of us.
I had a feeling something bad was about to happen.
Was it a nice trip?
How's everything at work?
How tall is that tower?
I converted to Christianity.
Could you please pass me the pepper?
Season with salt and pepper and add a pinch of nutmeg.
I as well as my brother am to blame.
"You and Tom will travel together, won't you?"
You'd better consult the doctor.
I never want to see that guy again.
Don't say anything to Tom.
I decided to wait in line to buy some super cheap eggs.
Do you think this book is worth reading?
Tom's father is rich.
She is very busy.
It's over.
Tom walked away and soon disappeared into the fog.
That's obvious.
What does it mean?
The top part is turning clockwise.
This winter will be very cold.
I have got to go now.
I'm still up.
He stayed at the hotel.
Wait a little longer.
"By the time I got there, the lecture had already started."
I got up early this morning to go fishing.
I need to vacuum the car.
I hate this car.
I come here every day.
Tom was not able to quit smoking.
Today is the last day of work.
It's about time to start.
I can't believe it!
Isn't the scope of the test pretty broad this time?
"At the very least, I'd like to be able to have everyday conversations."
Money is important.
I don't read newspapers much.
Hi.
"I'm not rich, nor do I wish to be."
I'm glad to see you.
It's too heavy for me to lift.
How often do you use the Internet?
He runs very fast.
The South Pole is a lot colder than the North Pole.
He was accused of murder.
The trains are running on schedule.
It doesn't matter very much which college you graduated from.
Black hens lay white eggs.
Tom said that he wanted to be alone and then he went upstairs to his bedroom.
Is there a bank near the train station?
She didn't feel like eating lunch.
The warmth of Tom's hug soothed me.
Are you hitting on me?
There was a brief break in the discussion.
"She was able to cook herself dinner, after a fashion."
I'm going to get more exercise.
I don't need a receipt.
That building over there is owned by our company.
Do you care when we leave?
When did you buy it?
Fresh fruit and vegetables are good for your health.
Are you going for a walk?
Is somebody teaching you French?
We don't live here.
I've been trying to quit smoking.
Tom may be right.
I'm sure it got broken during shipping.
Maybe Tom will help.
Tom slipped the money in his pocket.
I heard somebody screaming.
I was a kid at that time.
You can't be too careful when you drive.
I don't have freckles.
Have you ever eaten eggs with ketchup?
Tom drank all the water.
Do you happen to have some aspirin?
I don't want to grow up.
Everyone is equal before the law.
A lot of soldiers were killed here.
"If Tom comes, what should I say to him?"
Have there been any changes?
Are you still depressed?
This project was a great success.
You'd better make sure that it's true.
Are you having any chest pain?
They embraced each other.
"When I met her the other day, she asked about my parents."
I thought we would have breakfast together.
Now tell me about yourself.
Tom knew I knew.
The committee passed the bill.
That apple was really delicious.
"Is this yours, Tom?"
Tom hit his head on the roof of his car.
My wife's trying to sleep.
It's awfully hot today.
I'm getting better.
Could I please borrow your pen?
Who did you go skiing with?
I've tried every diet that has ever been published and I still haven't lost weight.
Take the jam down from the top shelf.
The police caught the burglar red-handed.
I advised him on what books to read.
That's odd.
Do you regret doing that?
Wooden buildings catch fire easily.
"I had a fever yesterday, so I didn't go to school."
The icy road sparkled in the sunlight.
How long will you stay here?
The boy observed the birds all day.
Tom is the type of person who calls a spade a spade.
"If you want security in your old age, begin saving now."
My friends don't play tennis.
The ticket is good for three days.
This air conditioner uses a lot of electricity.
I refrain from drinking.
Can you identify the man in this picture?
I ache all over.
I just wanted to know his name.
"If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it."
Tom seemed to be in high spirits.
You can't have your own way in everything.
It's dangerous to play with fire.
Did you really bake the pie by yourself?
I'm worried about your health.
He was willing to help others.
Tom has been on the phone for hours.
I want to invite Tom and Mary over for dinner.
Pick me an apple.
The hamburger is a famous American dish.
"Next time, you might not be so lucky."
Our fridge is empty.
There seems to be something wrong with this clock.
"I am not sure, but I think I want to be a teacher."
Tom was carrying a bucket of water.
Tom says he'll come.
You're part of the problem.
We've finished cleaning the classroom.
He gathered his books together.
I'm not going to tell Tom what happened.
I don't care anymore what people think of me.
There is no doubt.
"Speak French, please."
His way of thinking is a bit extreme.
Tom hates studying French.
It isn't easy to find work nowadays.
"Sure, go right ahead."
Tell me about it.
Would you like some more cake?
What were you doing today?
I have heard that song sung in French.
This is above me.
I smell gasoline.
I spent the summer vacation at my aunt's house.
It was Tom who gave me this apple.
There's no air on the moon.
My cellphone is ringing.
This is an ancient law.
He is just killing time.
Here's a news flash.
Where exactly did you find that?
I think you've got the flu.
The twin girls are so much alike that I can't tell one from the other.
Why don't you give tennis a try?
Never in my life have I seen such a terrible accident.
I've never seen him wearing jeans.
Do you still believe in Santa Claus?
We learned at school that the square root of nine is three.
I don't know how to get there.
Tell me a little bit about your trip.
Tom didn't realize what was happening.
The man blushed.
"It being a fine day, I went out for a walk."
You should get some rest.
His grandfather is still very healthy for his age.
He is generous with his money.
Tokyo is the largest city in Japan.
This bread is fresh from the oven.
English is like a universal language.
I didn't want to go either.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
Are you planning to buy that?
You should always do your best.
That's a nice car you're driving.
Where did you buy that hat that you were wearing yesterday?
Buy me a red one.
I'm going to stay there for a couple of days.
Could you come and see me tomorrow?
It's not easy being popular.
Please tell me where to go.
Here's a picture of my family.
My screen is cracked.
The wall gave way in the earthquake.
She got up late.
The cat lay hidden behind the bushes.
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm going to get you something to drink.
Staying up late at night is very bad for your skin.
Tom felt homesick during his stay in Boston.
I think this is mine.
This is the book that I told you about.
I don't want to wake the children up.
Could you show me another one?
I don't like mathematics very much.
I asked her to marry me and she accepted.
He also speaks French.
Was Tom watching TV last night?
A doctor told me that eating eggs was bad for me.
"I'd like coffee rather than tea, please."
"When it stops raining, let's go for a walk."
We are doctors.
My college has dormitories.
"Beautiful day, isn't it?"
It's been ten years since I came to this town.
Is it done?
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Someone's waiting outside.
I can't make myself understood in German.
I said get out.
Tom is a little bit younger than Mary.
I'll go eat lunch and then come back.
The hospital is next to the school.
It is said that his mother is gravely ill.
Don't speak with your mouth full.
He is employed in a bank.
Tom lives in our neighborhood.
I think that car is a little too small for you.
There were bags of various sizes.
You have good reason to be angry.
These pants don't have a pocket.
Tom wrote a short story.
She made a good speech.
"I'm sorry, but I'm against this project."
It's the perfect place for a romantic dinner.
There are a lot of problems we can't avoid.
She was nearly frozen to death in the snow.
"If it snows a lot tomorrow, let's make a snowman."
Please be polite.
I need to finish writing my speech.
Would you like to go fishing on Saturday afternoon?
He is still full of energy.
What's Tom's social security number?
He's a good person.
Luxembourg is a small country.
It may snow.
Let them come in.
Napoleon was exiled to the island of St. Helena.
How many pens do you want?
Where did you meet Tom?
I've botched things up so bad I wish I could find a hole to climb into.
I have to choose between these two.
"Yesterday, I was caught speeding."
He will come after all.
"To tell the truth, I didn't go there."
Mother gets up earlier than anybody else in my family.
That naughty child needs a good beating.
Tom speaks English with a strong French accent.
May I take a bite?
Today was a beautiful day.
Jupiter is very large.
Did you find what you were looking for?
I think I'm really in love for the first time.
Have you ever seen a spider spinning a web?
Tom looked happy.
My room faces east.
Let's have lunch.
"I, too, have a question."
Would you like a cupcake?
Please wait till noon.
I'm awfully tired.
"If it looks like an apple and it tastes like an apple, it's probably an apple."
"I have a fever, so I'll be absent from school today."
This is the watch that I bought yesterday.
Tom continued walking.
My mother stopped her sewing and picked up her book.
You've dropped your wallet.
He was wet all over.
Typhoid is a scary disease.
He pressed me for a prompt reply.
"I feel like playing cards. ""So do I."""
Your composition is perfect except for a few mistakes.
I like this book.
"You're responsible for everything that's happened, aren't you?"
I think it's going to be a nice day.
I want to go to town.
Why were you absent from class?
Tom is a math geek.
May I try this on?
Is that the belt I gave you?
They are deeply in love.
I want to take a rest.
The day is sure to come when your dream will come true.
"The ground is still wet. As likely as not, the game will be canceled."
I'm buying fruit and chocolate.
Tom seemed to be surprised.
He knows how to play the piano.
You're always watching TV.
There's nothing in the fridge.
I knew that already.
I was off duty at the time.
I take a short nap every day.
Everything is OK.
Were you in Boston last week?
Do you have any other hotels you would recommend?
I like this picture.
The dog wants to go outside again.
We stayed in Hawaii over Christmas.
"We protested, but it was in vain."
I can't speak French at all.
It was really muggy yesterday.
Did you hear my show last night?
I'm allergic to some medicine.
Our son will be 20 years old in two years.
I don't feel like eating now.
Tom shared his mother's oatmeal cookie recipe with Mary.
You're watching TV all the time.
The baby is sleeping.
I have a son who's just turned three.
She will come even if she is tired.
I thought you'd agree with me.
I asked her out on a date.
His voice broke when he was twelve.
"Give me the same, please."
Did you enjoy your trip?
It's not nice to hit people.
I've never heard of that city.
There are a lot of houses here.
None of the games were exciting.
Let go of my hand.
Tom wants to learn how to drive a tractor.
I paid for it with a credit card.
Let's catch a quick bite.
We have no time.
He looked around the waiting room.
I'm voting no.
He was declared guilty.
It's me!
Tom bought some sandwiches for us.
Help yourself to these cookies.
That's a good idea.
Sit down and be quiet.
It's going to be crowded everywhere.
There is no denying the fact.
Tom sat on the bench.
Come back before it's too late.
I'm not available right now.
I saw your photographs.
Are you studying?
I did not want to attract attention.
He took out the wallet from his inside jacket pocket.
How many cats are there in this house?
The honor is more than I deserve.
Is anybody watching us?
The road is closed.
The atomic number of copper is 29.
He stopped to talk to them.
You're a really good photographer.
Those three are his daughters.
I want to get to know you better.
The war began three years later.
What's the airmail rate?
Tom got stung by a bee.
Please don't leave it there.
Who is absent?
It's too late to do that.
Tom is an able cricket player.
How old is your father?
Don't get off the bus till it stops.
I had no idea that Tom knew how to speak French.
Don't put it that way.
Don't kid me!
This medicine tastes awful.
Tom and I are mad at each other.
It's awfully cold today.
The day's over.
She became an actress.
You knew all along that I couldn't do that.
Grandmother looks after the children during the day.
What was it I left behind?
"Honey, are you OK?"
The piano in Tom's house is out of tune.
She was able to go to college thanks to the scholarship.
Don't be afraid to try new things.
He is good at cooking.
I don't know how to explain it.
I was encouraged by his words.
Are you talking to yourself?
I actually have a split personality.
He was in good spirits.
My home is on the eighth floor.
Two pints are equal to a quart.
It snowed yesterday.
"I took my temperature, but it was normal."
Don't come any closer.
I wonder whether the weather will hold.
He never said it again.
The two of us are finally alone.
Have you ever been to America?
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary goodnight last night.
I usually wear a suit.
It's been a long time since we last met.
I do not agree with you at all.
Tom danced awkwardly.
Tom suddenly fell ill.
Tom is taking his final exam.
I won!
I would rather have a coffee.
I saw a man enter the room.
I have a lot of things to do today.
My fever won't go away.
Hand in the three sheets of paper together.
I got here last night.
What's the departure time?
You can't enter this room.
It's time to go to bed. Turn the radio off.
Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
The printer ran out of paper.
I have a bad pain in my lower back.
It isn't necessary.
Prices have been gradually rising in recent years.
I'm busier this week than I was last week.
How much longer will it take?
I'd like to confirm my reservation for the 30th.
"He doesn't eat this, does he?"
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
"Can you call a doctor, please?"
What brought you to Boston?
I have a headache.
Don't worry. The ambulance will be here soon.
"If I'm to become a regular, I have to work twice as hard as the rest."
"If there's anything I can do to help, let me know."
All was silent in the house.
We know how to swim.
"Mary is really pretty, isn't she?"
We need more workers.
Are you still sick?
"Anyone who protested, lost his job."
I'm going shopping this afternoon. Would you like to come along?
I have something else to do.
Who's that woman standing over there?
Smoking is harmful to your health.
I really like Tom a lot.
They're expressing their love by hugging.
Is this Tom Jackson's house?
Tom never orders pizza.
Would you like to go to the park later this afternoon?
We'll definitely be back next year.
I had a letter from her yesterday.
We met her brother at the shop by chance.
Tom doesn't know how Mary will get to school tomorrow.
I asked him to wait here.
I'd like to use these coupons.
I'm super hungry.
Both of my parents have passed away.
Are you satisfied with your job?
Tom worked until late at night.
I've heard nothing.
I'm feeling down today.
That store is open every day of the year.
She grew roses.
My mother really likes cake.
This is how they catch an elephant alive.
My garden is a mess.
Where is your house?
When does summer break start?
He's nothing but a fool.
You are late. The meeting finished thirty minutes ago.
We couldn't play outdoors because of the intense heat.
He probably won't come.
Tom's mother was a devout Catholic.
You'd better back off.
This word has two meanings.
I think it is a mere coincidence.
It seems that the rainy season is over at last.
I don't have any pens.
Are you still angry with Tom?
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
We were glad to hear Tom got back safely.
Will Tom come home soon?
"I was born in Osaka, but brought up in Tokyo."
He hates spiders.
The moon is the earth's only satellite.
One should always make the most of one's opportunities.
That doesn't sound familiar.
He's power-hungry.
This blouse is cotton.
Please turn the light off.
It's empty.
I'll leave that to you.
I had no idea it would cost so much.
I like white roses better than red ones.
I always drink two cups of coffee in the morning.
He has already said yes.
Can I ask you one more question?
I always eat before going to school.
"At last, he found out how to make it."
The picture brought back a lot of memories.
This is a pretty good camera.
She advocated equal rights for women.
"In spring, the days get longer."
You'll regret it someday.
I've never delivered a baby.
There is a school down the mountain.
Tom hates that word.
There's an emergency situation.
Tom told Mary that she needs to wear a helmet.
Shall we walk to the station?
I wonder whether or not the weather will hold.
You are only young once.
I played tennis and went swimming during my summer vacation.
Try it once again.
The noise suddenly stopped.
I'm busy all day today.
They didn't wish to go any further.
The pears we eat in Japan look almost like apples.
A refrigerator keeps meat fresh.
I cut down a tree yesterday.
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
The cat is sleeping.
The festival came to an end.
Tom is a fast learner.
Is there a hat shop nearby?
I didn't see that.
I received her letter the other day.
He told me about the accident as if he had seen it with his own eyes.
Who painted this painting?
I can't afford to buy a car.
Please confirm your reservation.
That's all for tonight.
I like glossy paper.
I pretended not to understand what he was saying.
"Every time she coughed, she felt a great deal of pain."
Are you going to go with Tom?
I love lizards.
Shut up and listen.
Dinner's ready.
She parked her car in a vacant lot.
She handed him the money.
I have to go to the station right away.
My wife died of cancer.
Summer vacation starts in July.
I cannot afford a camera above 300 dollars.
I will be staying for two nights.
I'll never do this again.
This is very small.
Give me back my pencil.
Put the medicine where children can't get at it.
Tom arrived this morning.
He thinks I'm jealous.
May I ask you a question?
Tom tickled the baby's feet.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
It sounds like a nice place to live.
Have you ever spoken to Tom?
I have a friend who's a vegetarian.
Tom lives in a larger apartment than mine.
Who are you talking with?
He can't be ill.
Stay away from it.
"No matter where I go, I get lost."
I've had a lot on my mind recently and have had trouble falling asleep at night.
The results of the test were negative.
I'm going to give you one last chance.
I don't want to hear your excuses.
I had a snack before I went back to work.
I don't know why Tom did this.
Tell me when to start.
We should check the spread of the disease.
I know that Tom is a bartender.
She soon adjusted herself to the new school.
It's obvious what needs to be done.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmer.
Tom said that he thought I was dead.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I was very chubby when I was a child.
Can you get by on your wages?
I felt my hands tremble.
I refused at first.
That isn't right.
Tom is doing well in his lessons at school.
At your age you should know better.
Strawberries are made into jam.
The school is near my house.
I'm fat.
She lost a book.
"When you find Tom, let me know."
I'm worried.
She was busy doing her hair.
"Thanks to your help, I was able to finish early."
It's really stinky.
He has a date with Mary this afternoon.
The boy has an apple in his pocket.
This garden is open to the public.
She has a sharp tongue.
I'd like to try on this dress.
She has about as many stamps as I do.
Some students don't like wearing uniforms.
I've spent so many years as chairman that I feel it's time I stepped down.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
I can't believe a place like this really exists.
Tom hasn't kissed Mary yet.
"When the teacher is very strict, the students must mind their P's and Q's."
When were you busy yesterday?
Tom is not as tall as Mary.
My aunt dropped in on me yesterday.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
We have more apples than we could eat in a day.
It's your bedtime.
Haven't you been listening?
Don't go back to sleep!
I couldn't come because of the rain.
I'm counting on you.
I didn't know you wrote poems.
I hear you are taking English lessons.
I shouldn't have stayed up so late last night.
Mary is Tom's girlfriend.
"She ignored him, which proved unwise."
I don't want to learn French.
She visits him twice a year.
I broke my leg skiing.
Tom and I went to a piano recital.
The sun is going down.
He's at her side.
How long will the storm last?
Tom became a cop.
Can you do bookkeeping?
Do you have this in a size 13?
The monkey ate my banana.
Turn the light on. I can't see a thing.
You can borrow three books at a time.
"As far as I could see, everything was covered with snow."
I love you and I always will.
I met a girl with long hair.
Don't use this hammer.
I saw my sister there.
Tom attempted to persuade Mary to go to church with him.
Sit down over there.
Try again.
I'm hungry.
My room is smaller than my brother's.
You had better turn off the light before you go to sleep.
"The dip was so hot, it burned my tongue."
"Because I had a bad cold, I went to bed earlier than usual."
He knows us very well.
Why did you want to buy that?
Have you ever eaten sushi?
Please have Tom do that for me.
The wind is blowing hard right now.
I'd prefer not to go to Australia.
An eight-year-old car is almost worthless.
I don't think anybody else could do my job.
"In Japan, all children go to school."
We're looking forward to seeing you.
I'd hardly walked a mile when it began to thunder.
Tom writes me every day.
Tom went to Boston with me.
Please take me home.
She certainly looks beautiful in a Japanese kimono.
Are you always this quiet?
"Will you warm the milk, please?"
The world has become dangerous.
He's an honest man.
What number should I call in case of an emergency?
A tiger will attack people when it's hungry.
How did you get my phone number?
I'll call when I've finished the work.
He never listens to what his father says.
"I'm sorry, but I don't feel like going out today."
You're the boss.
I'll remember this incident forever.
Are you going to do your homework before dinner?
Tom couldn't keep a straight face.
Tom lives in a residential area.
My mother was in tears.
I understood absolutely nothing.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
He got through his work.
What kinds of books do you like?
Children are curious about everything.
You can go home if you like.
Eating too much is bad for your health.
I'll pay the bill.
Pick it up.
Let's grab something to eat.
Please sign here.
I know when Tom's birthday is.
My boyfriend and I have been together for seven years already.
Please go ahead.
I was the happiest man on earth.
Is this the first time you've been here?
I was too astonished to speak.
I worry about my future.
Don't give up yet. I'm sure you can do it.
It's too long.
My eyes water when I cut onions.
"There are other opinions, too."
The woman Tom married is very beautiful.
Get out of the kitchen.
I had chicken pox when I was a kid.
This honey is very thick.
His explanation was not satisfactory.
The station isn't far from here.
Tom served us a good meal.
I want to sing a song.
She looks happy.
I'll send you home in my car.
I shouldn't be laughing.
See you at 2:30.
Avoid crossing this street when it is raining.
"When I'm sleepy, I go to bed."
All of us like Tom.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
I'll make some sandwiches for you.
A year has twelve months.
I wonder if that's Tom.
We had a great time together.
"What I want now isn't money, but time."
I have a lot on my plate.
She's absent because she's sick.
I won't get anyone in trouble.
The front door remained locked.
Please come to meet me at the station.
Who said this to you?
Try doing it again.
Tom said he wanted to marry me.
The job is half done.
I've been waiting for almost half an hour.
He kept silent all day.
How did you learn French?
She decided to go.
I am looking for my brother.
She really likes cats a lot.
I'm not so happy.
Does this bus go to the beach?
Where are the girls sitting?
I figured out why the machine wouldn't work.
"Pet food is cheap, so let's stock up."
It's been a long time.
I wish I hadn't given Tom my phone number.
May I ask you for your name and address?
Be careful.
Is there somebody here who speaks French?
My pen has run out of ink.
Tom is proficient in French.
I don't like being treated like a child.
This book is heavy.
I study math harder than you do.
What are your hobbies?
I think I've heard that somewhere before.
You look like your mom.
Life jackets are under your seats.
It won't do you any harm.
Can I call you Tom?
Any book will be okay as long as it is interesting.
"You understand, right?"
Is this art?
Peaches are fuzzy.
Tom is getting married tomorrow.
I thought you were from Boston.
It's too cold to go on a picnic today.
The match is just about to begin.
They walked their dog in the park.
She is a wonderful woman.
There you are.
There are many people who believe that God exists.
All of my ex-girlfriends live in Boston.
I hate birthday parties.
I'm pretty sure that Tom won't get fired.
"To put it bluntly, the reason this team won't win is because you're holding them back."
Mary is a beautiful girl.
You're tough.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
A mirage is said to be an illusion.
You should leave immediately.
Tom missed the last train.
I'm not in the least concerned about the result.
We're making dessert.
I think that Tom will like this gift.
My back feels stiff.
Are you going to the post office?
You should take an umbrella with you.
Where is the tourist information office?
I don't have the slightest idea what to do.
Why should I apologize to you?
This program is a rerun.
"So far, so good."
I haven't finished my supper yet.
Do you have an appointment?
"In order to get a reservation, you must use her name."
This summer is unusually hot.
The weather forecast says it will be fine tomorrow.
All my friends turned their backs on me.
My father likes strong coffee.
I'd like to hear that song again.
I will come with you.
"In 1955, the cancer returned and she died in 1956 at the age of 42."
I got the tickets for free.
Let's stay here.
Have you had lunch yet?
Could you please shut the door?
He came into the room.
The queen shook hands with each player after the game.
That's the trouble.
I'll go change my clothes.
"You're the new secretary, aren't you?"
People living in a big city tend to lack exercise.
I can't believe you don't like ice cream.
What does IMHO mean?
These shoes are too expensive.
We've lived in this town for three years.
That's Tom's step-sister.
The Jacksons are my neighbors.
"I want brown shoes, not black ones."
My wife is a good manager.
Are you booked for tomorrow?
Tom didn't tell Mary about his financial problems.
This old car breaks down all the time.
Let us know if you need anything.
I pawned my guitar to pay the rent.
He killed himself at the age of thirty.
Let's make Valentine's Day chocolate today.
Tom drank vodka.
You know that I can't wait any longer.
Do you know how to get there?
Birds build nests.
A green carpet won't go well with these blue curtains.
She shut the door on her finger.
I planted some fruit trees.
I apologize again.
I don't feel well.
Hand me a tissue.
"When I fell off my bicycle, I couldn't get up for a few minutes."
Take a short walk every day.
I really miss you all.
"Three days ago, I got a haircut."
I know lots of pilots.
"Tom is good with children, isn't he?"
A child is playing harp.
Tom apparently waited for three hours.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
"I was tired last night, so I went to bed early."
How long can I keep this book?
Where's the nearest gas station around here?
Japanese history interests me.
The air is dry today.
Tom is as fast as a leopard.
"Tom finished his homework, so he went to bed."
This is a new kind of melon.
This book was easy for me to read.
I've gained weight.
Have you lived here for a long time?
"Sooner or later, you'll tell me everything."
He easily gets angry.
"Would you mind opening the window? ""Of course not."""
Wait a sec.
Don't blame others for your failure.
Do you have a shoehorn?
I boiled an egg.
Slow and steady wins the race.
"I respect you, Tom."
You're shameless.
I felt a bit guilty.
I water the flowers in the garden every day.
Tom is just slightly taller than Mary.
Tom swore he didn't tell anybody our secret.
He arrived after I had left.
Detroit is famous for its car industry.
He is a dentist by profession.
His claim is that there is a close relation between birth order and personality.
Are there any bags in this shop?
His train arrived at Tokyo Station.
Leaves were whirling in the air.
Think carefully before you promise anything.
Tom can't tie his shoelaces by himself.
It's none of my business!
Are you crying?
I can't explain that either.
Tom knew how to do it.
That dog barks at strangers.
I saw a young boy crossing the street by himself.
Tom is the perfect son.
Her face was drenched with sweat.
We're running out of gas.
We have three cats.
That was a waste of money.
Tom tried to teach Mary how to do that.
My leg was bitten by that dog.
What did you watch on television last night?
Kids learn quickly.
This is very small.
She poured me some tea.
I don't know for certain when he will come.
"Don't fall asleep. If you fall asleep, you'll die."
Everyone loves puppets.
"We waited for Tom at the library for half an hour, but he didn't come."
His English is quite good.
It wasn't until a few days later that he arrived.
Tom doesn't look all that tired.
Classes start in April.
I don't know who Tom's wife is.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
They are about the same age.
We're different.
It is going to rain soon.
It's balmy today.
It is close to seven o'clock. We have to go to school.
English is not my first language.
Tom has trouble opening bottles.
She was fatter ten years ago than she is now.
How's it going?
Did you carry out your plan?
I'm on holiday this week.
Stars can be seen at night.
Tom says he wants to quit the band.
I don't have any money.
My season ticket expires on March thirty-first.
He was exhausted when he got home.
"I'm so happy, I feel like I could fly."
I don't believe that ghosts exist.
I can touch the ceiling.
Keep it up.
May I see you tomorrow?
I got furious.
The train leaves at six.
My uncle lived a happy life.
Can I ask you a question?
It's not worth discussing.
Tom wants to run for class president.
Tom doesn't know anything about computer programming.
You haven't changed at all.
I want to be a doctor.
I've decided to postpone my trip to Boston.
Tom is always late to meetings.
Do you like white wine?
Was Tom the one who suggested this?
Horses are useful animals.
He bought a car.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss your train."
I received her letter the other day.
I don't know anything about his past.
I hope that your mother gets well soon.
I played tennis after I studied.
I had doubts.
You can meet Tom there.
This table is clean.
"I'll open the curtains, so you can see outside."
The weather in Boston today is great.
She's assertive.
I couldn't solve this problem by any means.
I lived in this house as a kid.
"Before I knew it, my cooking skills had improved."
Some people insist that television does more harm than good.
Today's meeting has been canceled.
I'm in the attic.
Why do people go to movies?
I want to eat popcorn.
Were you in Boston last summer?
Can you manage to complete the manuscript by Friday?
I'd never ever do that.
Doing that was quite difficult.
Don't make me laugh!
Give me your phone number.
I wanted to make sure.
The damage from the flood was negligible.
"If you haven't driven a bike yet, you should give it a shot."
I want to build an igloo.
You should make sure that you get there on time. Tom won't wait more than ten minutes if you are late.
I'm happy as well.
Tom read to Mary.
I'd like seats on the first floor.
Could you explain it more simply?
They aren't my real parents.
There was no one about.
I will not do it again.
I usually wear jeans.
I want to sleep in my own bed.
That's more recent than you think it is.
Do you drive a manual or automatic?
Where did you see the woman?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
No one knows what happened at that time.
Tom suddenly got sick.
I'm just looking around.
He sent a letter addressed to his uncle.
This is the last train.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
The cookies are in the jar.
It's too dark to play baseball now.
I would like to go home now.
I need a frame for this painting.
Let me see it again.
Please take the table outside.
I can't break this code.
I didn't know that you had a boyfriend.
You'd better go to the dentist.
Have you been there several times?
I don't mind waiting.
May I ask you a favor?
I don't know what advice to give you.
I can't take any more of this.
What subject are you studying?
"Oh, no! My house is on fire!"
I saw a woman in black.
I get paid every month.
Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
Everyone in my family gets up early.
Please come back as soon as possible.
Maybe you'd better not do that.
It's a great spot for swimming.
The nurse will tell you how to do it.
The tired boy is fast asleep.
Don't talk about that in front of Tom.
The post office is a few minutes' walk from here.
Those animals were in danger of dying out.
"What do you want? ""I want a dog."""
This is a very important point.
I have to be careful.
I did that for you.
May I go outside?
The ATM is out of order.
Who is the girl singing on the stage?
"Where are you? ""In the garden."""
All of my children went to good universities.
She left her children behind.
Tom and Mary are outside making a snowman.
"Two colas, please."
I consider him to be an excellent teacher.
Thank you for lending the book to us.
Give my regards to your parents.
I wish I could come up with a good answer to the question.
Who spoke with Tom?
I have the feeling that I'll sleep well tonight.
She has been sick in bed for a week.
Who is next?
Find Tom.
We will discuss this problem later.
It's very warm in this room.
"Men cry, too."
Why were you absent yesterday?
I've been feeling stressed lately.
I wish I could travel around the world.
I actually never knew that.
I work for an oil company.
Let's take the subway.
Tom stole one of my shoes.
We should celebrate together.
The archer killed the deer.
You should be more careful with your money.
I want to go to another country.
It looks like I've caught a cold.
He tied the twigs into bundles.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
My uncle went to Mexico in 1983 and never returned.
I was caught in a shower this afternoon.
The result of the election will be announced tomorrow.
He was the envy of his friends.
Imagine yourself to be on the moon.
What's your opinion about that?
I'm sure that she has arrived at the village by now.
Do I have to write in ink?
Ireland is in western Europe.
Tell me about your boyfriend.
Don't touch that button!
This room is for rent.
Tom got back yesterday.
We need to sell our house.
A bright idea came to me.
We'll accept your conditions.
Go back to the lab.
I seem to have left my umbrella on the train.
The boy lay listening to the radio.
Humans are the only animals capable of laughter.
He failed because he did not have money.
Lock the door!
Enter your password.
He looks as if he were ill.
How old is this temple?
Are you telling me the truth?
I have a favor to ask.
Tom retired at the age of 65.
"May I see your passport, please?"
Do you want to go again?
Tom likes antique furniture.
I kneeled down.
Tom never wants to see Mary again.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
She fooled him.
Tom was blackmailed by Mary.
I didn't order this.
I was really nervous.
I'm extremely tired.
Don't worry about it.
Those books are always in great demand.
I read The New York Times.
Why is Tom waiting outside?
My father and I sometimes go fishing together.
"In the winter it's cold, so we turn the stove on."
Tom kicked the trash can.
He couldn't speak French well.
Please give my regards to your father.
Are you crazy?
That isn't my problem.
Sorry to trouble you.
Please answer the phone.
I decided to stay home.
I hardly ever walk to work.
I can't quite understand it.
The station is in the center of the city.
"Recently, no matter how much I sleep, it never seems to be enough."
I had to take a cab.
Tom just can't get along with Mary.
I didn't do it for you.
Tom is wearing thick glasses.
Our plans for tomorrow depend on the weather.
There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
"I don't think it will rain, but I'll take an umbrella just in case."
Be careful not to slip on the ice.
The rate of exchange is 145 yen to the dollar.
We learn a lot from experience.
"October is Tom's favorite month, and perhaps mine, too."
I recommend this book.
How's your new job going?
This is the third time I've been here.
Phone me tomorrow at nine.
"Hey, this pizza isn't bad. Not bad at all."
Everyone's saying it.
Tom took off his tie and started unbuttoning his shirt.
I was lonely.
Give that to him.
I wish I were still single.
The door is made of glass.
Tom looks really guilty.
He has a dual personality.
My car is a hybrid.
The students left.
This melody reminds me of my school days.
We're open every day except Monday.
How was your afternoon?
He has a good knowledge of the internal affairs of Japan.
Thank you for coming today.
We were able to catch the last train.
Please give me some more butter.
Let's just speak French.
She said she couldn't believe it.
I'll be back at half past six.
I'll call you up this evening.
He's in the hospital.
The dog wants in.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
I'm starved.
It's so easy.
I'm not a thief.
He still loves her.
These are common diseases of children.
I'm just looking.
He ran away with the money.
I was thrown off guard.
Tom and Mary are both from Australia.
I try not to bother anyone.
Tom wrote down his phone number.
You may go home.
This is the first time I've heard that word.
Do you have any tattoos?
Mary broke in on our conversation.
I was invited by an old friend.
I must be away on urgent business.
She is as busy as a bee.
Could you please turn on the radio?
I'm going to the park now.
Tom is coming here now.
Don't do it again.
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
I'll be waiting for you at the usual place.
Everyone is looking forward to next year.
No one gave up hope.
Tom has a friend who lives in Australia.
"No matter what happens, I'll go."
Study hard so you don't fail.
This is a very beautiful color.
This gate needs to be painted.
Tom certainly knew what he was doing was illegal.
I won't be going to school today.
He's still young.
There was an enormous traffic jam in downtown Kyoto.
I love to read books.
Spanish is her native language.
Not all English people like fish and chips.
She likes oranges.
I'm taking it easy.
Remember these rules.
No one will know.
Let's go out for some ramen.
He's a pushover.
I was famous when I was younger.
We've got to fill this hole with something.
Does everybody have paper?
What's the difference between a dog and a wolf?
I can jump.
"Next week, I'm going to Boston."
Today was a lot of fun.
I feel cold.
Tom has braces.
I hurried home.
Tom is too old to be living on his own.
Please eat it while it's still hot.
"What are you doing, Dad?"
I told Tom about myself.
Where is the accent on the word 'Australia?'
You should ask Tom.
We love dogs.
It'll be Christmas soon.
What quantity of paper do you need?
I arrived at the station.
"Tom clicked the ""send"" button."
Tom's childhood dream was to become a veterinarian.
I saw Tom last week.
What is important is not which university you've graduated from but what you've learned in the university.
The human body is composed of billions of small cells.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
I met her three days ago.
Don't you know cheese is made from milk?
I'm traveling by myself.
She could not keep back a smile.
The cat lay hidden in the bushes.
Ask Tom about it.
You have to pace yourself or you'll choke halfway through.
I don't think that it'll work.
This dictionary isn't any good.
This wine is cheap.
Who wants to go next?
She criticized him for being late.
There is close relationship between supply and demand.
Give me the gun.
An ugly man knocked on my door.
Do it Monday.
That story is a famous one that everyone knows.
Tom is taller than I am.
I haven't made much progress.
You don't have to answer right away.
I've been busy.
He thanked his host for a most enjoyable party.
I hope you pass the test.
Is Tom still overseas?
Have you washed your hands yet?
Are you wearing a watch?
It's about time you got up.
It's time to put the plan in action.
Why did you park so far away?
It's close to eleven. It's about time we went to bed.
I wonder if he will come.
Don't get off the train till it stops.
We have the same name.
There are a lot of red flowers in the garden.
How much does Tom know about Mary?
Tom sneezes a lot.
"I'm all thumbs, so I'm not very good at origami."
She is French.
"Because his parents had died when he was young, his uncle brought him up."
Are you comfortable in that chair?
It's entirely up to you.
There used to be rice fields around here.
This suitcase is too heavy for me to carry.
Tom is a good worker.
I'll see you next Wednesday.
I'll leave the rest to you.
My sister washes her shoes every Sunday.
We're not acquainted with each other.
I decided to come to Japan last year.
I don't think Tom likes Mary very much.
Turn off the light.
This can of beans is expired.
Tom unbuttoned his shirt.
Tom showed Mary the scar on his leg.
I'm a stranger here myself.
I came to Japan four years ago intending to stay for one year.
Some of my friends can speak English well.
I wrote this report.
We don't have snow here.
"Having done my homework, I watched the baseball game on television."
I've decided to wait.
I have business in town.
I don't have a girlfriend right now.
I was wrong. Forget what I said.
"Do you, by any chance, speak French?"
My parents have gone to the airport to see my uncle off.
I'm not happy about this situation.
He came downstairs.

He did the reverse of what I asked.
That is mine.
Could you charge it to my room?
Did you go to the doctor?
I gave up all hope of survival.
I thought we were supposed to eat lunch together.
"If he had known her phone number, he could have called her up."
I'm not going to die.
I'm stupid.
"Even if I use both hands, I can't crack an egg without breaking the yolk."
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
The photo brought back many happy memories of my childhood.
How's your father?
May I pay by check?
Have you ever had a serious illness?
He's always breaking into our conversation.
A lot has happened today.
That's under consideration.
It snowed all week.
I don't like swimming in pools.
I need another pillow.
Tom wants to buy my old car.
He hung his coat on a hook.
Lake Biwa is the largest lake in Japan.
What's the daily rate?
Why don't we talk over coffee?
Will you please come to my party?
Won't you come to dine with us?
He accomplished his mission.
I'm looking for the remote control. Do you know where it is?
He doesn't seem to get on in the world.
Drink more water.
Tom is richer than Mary.
I gave the dog two pieces of meat.
They were listening to the radio.
My car's battery has died.
It is about ten minutes' walk to the station.
Go and shower first.
I wish he could have driven a car a year ago.
Do you bake bread?
I thought it would be an opportunity for you to improve your French.
She was coming down the stairs.
I wonder if I hurt Tom's feelings.
It was fun playing in the park.
Do you really think I'm that gullible?
Please teach me French.
It can only be bought here.
"In England, the subway isn't called ""the subway"", it's called ""the underground."""
Marriage is a lottery.
"You hate it, don't you?"
Was the bus crowded?
"You never learn, do you?"
Take a map with you in case you get lost.
We ran out of gas in the middle of the desert.
It's your turn to drive.
One of us will have to go.
Which glass should I use?
The car parked in front of Tom's house was blue.
"Since it was raining, I stayed home."
I like this coat. May I try it on?
They're all wearing name tags.
Let's complete this picture quickly.
Will you go shopping with me?
Where should I put my laundry?
Is it still for sale?
I expect him to be here by three.
How do you know light travels faster than sound?
None of the passengers escaped injury.
That work is effectively finished.

He's always bad-mouthing his wife.
I'm still waiting for my order.
My scalp is very itchy.
"On my way home, I came across an old friend."
He said he didn't eat meat.
That stroller is ours.
Don't buy things on credit.
Was your junior high school far from your home?
Take the garbage out.
That's a bit weird.
He is leaving home now.
What kind of book did you buy?
They adopted the orphan.
You should follow Tom's example.
Tom is a very good tennis player.
I was caught in traffic.
I know you very well.
Tom goes camping every chance he gets.
"In all likelihood, the president will serve a second term."
I didn't like Tom.
Will you open the window and air out this stuffy room?
Excuse me. Who are you?
What do you plan to do?
Many criminals in America are addicted to drugs.
Please do whatever that person tells you to do.
That old house is made of wood.
The oven is broken.
I bought this watch at an antique store.

Can we do that?

It's a quarter to two.

Please try that coffee. I think it's really delicious.
Money cannot make up for lost time.
I'll be home after football practice.
What's wrong? Are you OK?
I didn't know how to express myself.
Stay at home till noon.
What's the name of that restaurant?
Tom says that he wants to lose weight.
This book is about stars.
He's an expert in astronomy.
I just arrived now.
Where did you get this photo taken?
You'd better not see her now.
He was guilty of murder.
The security guards escorted Tom out of the building.
"If you should find any mistakes, please let me know at once."
I miss you.
You can't read this novel without crying.
Reading is his chief amusement.
"If our last batter had not hit a home run, team would've lost the game."
I wonder why birds migrate.
She takes after her father.
It was not until I had a baby myself that I knew what mother's love is.
You can't live without water.
The library is open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Won't you come with me?
Tom is a spoiled brat.
Will you lend me your knife?
Is that healthy?
Tom and Mary don't have much time to talk together. Their children are always demanding their attention.
Do you have a complaint to make?
You could be here for a long while.
I don't like people like Tom.
I have to go now.
I screamed and ran as fast as I could.
He has a strong personality.
I wish that I were better at French.
I wanted to save you.
Arabic is read from right to left.
Tom ate very little.
I got fired from my last job.
Tom took a picture of Mary standing under the cherry tree.
Tom has no other choice.
I won!
Are you going to write to your father?
Look out for rock slides.
She came at once.
Tom has borrowed a car.
"If you need someone to talk to, call me."
Wait a second.
Do I need this?
Who do you think I ran into today?
Tom made dinner.
Does anyone have an iPhone charger?
You have to do it on your own.
He promised me that he won't tell anybody.
How did you meet Tom?
Tom hates children.
They'll kill me.
I can't get rid of my cold.
The baby began to crawl.
I'll treat you.
"If I were to be born again, I would be a musician."
I think it's important to keep promises.
I'm not used to the job.
I feel like going to bed early tonight.
Would you draw me a map?
I went shopping yesterday.
This temple is famous for its cherry blossoms.
How long may I borrow this notebook?
What was that sound?
Tom appeared on television last night.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
Could you shut the door?
Come back home.
Tom has a squirrel.
He entered Tokyo University this spring.
She happily granted my request.
We watched a TV program the other day about your people.
Is that machine still usable?
Does Tom live by himself?
I like traveling.
I am okay.
"In the 1960's, Japanese college students demonstrated against their government."
I live right around the corner.
I asked him if he wanted a watch.
He has a house of his own.
She stood by him.
Is Tom still around?
"Boys, as a rule, are taller than girls."
I need a cup of coffee.
Would you prefer going by bus?
He failed to escape from the fire and burned to death.
I gave a lot of money to Tom.
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
She looks like her mother.
They say that you never forget your first love.
I go to work every day by train.
What does that poster mean?
One of my favorite songs is Hungry Spider.
Are all of you Canadians?
That large bag is mine.
Tom's sisters are both beautiful.
I don't have many Canadian friends.
Have you already made a reservation?
Tom goes to work by bicycle.
I'm a civilian.
Do it by yourself.
I was glad to hear of your success.
I used to play in this park.
We have to cut down our monthly expenses.
A boy was beating the drum.
I smell something burning in the kitchen.
She is quite satisfied with her new job.
"If 'd known, I would've let you know."
I don't think that you should quit your job.
It was typical of him to arrive late.
I'm just going to run down to the bank.
How's the soup?
They sell eggs at the supermarket.
I'd like a Bloody Mary.
You can't believe a word of it.
I hear someone coming.
I abhor spiders.
She was not in the mood for lunch.
Tom put the bowl of popcorn on the table.
"Hey, that's a good idea."
Tom sat on a bench smoking a cigarette.
Christmas is a special holiday.
I can't believe that you're eating what the doctor told you not to eat.
It's OK.
You should rewrite this.
I lost track of time.
I have nothing to declare.
Tom and Mary didn't invite me to their wedding.
It costs three dollars.
A crowd of people gathered in the street.
He broke his left arm.
That girl is good-looking.
Come on any day you like.
I didn't have enough money to buy Tom a gift.
Is this OK with you?
He is twice as old as she is.
I was almost hit by a truck.
"Quick, run after him."
She isn't a good cook.
I faxed a map to Tom.
The sheriff beat the suspect until he was almost dead.
Which team is the most likely to win the championship?
The last person is supposed to turn the light off.
Perhaps Tom was wrong.
Was Tom afraid?
You aren't permitted to bring dogs into this building.
Will you have another cup of tea?
Don't say it like that.
Both the house and the garden are in a bad state.
Her eyes brimmed with tears.
He was standing at the door.
I like your tie.
The picture is in black and white.
Where did you take your shoes off?
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
Make a guess.
I know that Tom says he doesn't like me.
I don't want to fail my exams.
Tom saw a shooting star.
"You don't like it, do you?"
I've been working since I was thirteen.
Thank you very much for all your kindness.
Read the kind of books that teach you something.
Aren't you guys sleepy?
When are you going abroad?
Tom played a waltz on the piano using only his thumbs and Mary was very impressed.
I discovered a very nice place today.
Happy Halloween!
I'm just a regular office worker.
He's been dead ten years.
The concert was a great success.
We would rather go to the zoo than to the park.
He arrived in time.
Let's eat at a Mexican restaurant next time.
Boys will be boys.
I hope that she'll get well soon.
The police are following us.
I'll treat you to dinner.
The photo is blurry.
It would be illogical.
Last night it was so hot that I couldn't sleep well.
Your dog looks thirsty.
Tom's parents died in a traffic accident.
Are you sure Tom doesn't have a girlfriend?
I wonder whether or not Tom will be late.
Do you believe in miracles?
My money's been stolen.
I have known him a long time.
Can you teach me to play chess?
The cafeteria was crowded.
Will there be an extra charge for that?
This is one of the dictionaries I told you about yesterday.
This letter has to be sent right away.
How many kids do you have?
He is suffering from a headache.
"Now that you mention it, I haven't chewed gum in years."
Tom said that as well.
I was a teacher.
I like that dress a lot.
Tom is bad at reading between the lines.
Our son was killed in the war.
Please wait until 3:00. She'll be back then.
Could you solve the problem?
Tom couldn't hold back his tears.
I lost the book you lent me.
Tom said Mary was very drunk.
I study English at home.
I am out of work.
I'm on the eighth floor.
Who ate all the pizza?
I'll treat you to dinner if you help me.
What's your specialty?
Will he be able to catch the train?
Tom can speak French almost as well as Mary.
I'm not ready to go.
I always feel good after I do my good deed for the day.
"If you hurry, you might catch the bus."
She has gone to Italy.
Have you ever had any serious illness?
What's the next station?
You don't have to do what Tom tells you to do.
This is a film for adults.
What have you come up with?
Can you think of a better idea than this one?
My bicycle was stolen.
You should know better now you are eighteen.
Tom wasn't wearing a name tag.
Did you call me last night?
I actually live not too far from here.
A storm prevented the plane from taking off.
My car battery is dead.
I probably speak French better than Tom.
Take off your boots.
Tom rents an apartment in Boston.
His story sounds true.
I have a boiled egg for breakfast every day.
Tom wants to see Mary again.
Both Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
I thought you didn't know that.
My school grades were average.
We have a kumquat tree in our yard.
I can't shake off my cold.
What do you take me for?
Tom has really changed a lot since last year.
I had a party at my place last Monday evening.
He was unable to move.
I don't feel like speaking French today.
Asking a non-native French speaker to translate a document into French is like asking an accountant to build you a house.
A housewife has many domestic duties.
There is yogurt in the fridge.
I'm afraid she may have the mumps.
I thought it would be difficult for her to get the tickets.
Are you free today?
I apologize.
I've tried doing it a number of times.
Tom had to clean the classroom by himself.
What woke you up?
We were all running short of money then.
Thank you very much for everything today.
"Which do you like better, sushi or tempura?"
My wallet has been stolen.
I don't know what to do.
I have a friend whose father is a veterinarian.
Please come back in two weeks.
"Your sister can't swim well, can she?"
Open the hood.
He was chosen captain.
It may have rained a little last night.
Seven policemen were killed.
I like pomegranates.
"You'll have to do it, whether you like it or not."
Who baked this cake?
Tofu goes well with good sake.
No student is allowed to enter the room.
The new school building is expected to be completed by spring next year.
You should rest a while. You look pale.
Can you do it alone?
Tom has been missing for almost three weeks.
Tom made a serious error.
I would do anything for you.
Tom put his racket on the ground.
Tom frowned.
There's a lot to do.
I wanted to thank you directly.
He ordered a beer.
You should obey your parents.
Go over there.
Tom turned off the water.
I met Tom in college.
The Christmas party has been canceled.
Tom took part in the summer festival.
I spent the whole morning with Tom.
Could you please be quiet? I'm trying to study.
Tom's house is full of toys.
I'm sorry to bother you.
Tom came to class in his pajamas.
"If you have nothing to do, why not read a book?"
Tom insisted on paying the bill.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
"How do you pronounce ""Wi-Fi"" in French?"
Tom and his parents moved to Australia.
Where is the railroad station?
Did you see a doctor?
Do you often come here?
I can hardly wait till I see you.
I'm walking right now.
I'm tired of working a nine-to-five job.
We elected Tom captain of the team.
The laundry room is in the basement.
This is the least expensive method of all.
"I thought that doing this would be easy, but we've been working all day and we're still not finished."
I don't like to send postcards when I'm on a trip.
We reduced the price by eliminating unnecessary functions.
Mary is Tom's wife.
I felt the house shaking terribly.
Are you sure that you locked the doors?
I think Tom is mistaken.
Please tell Tom that I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Can you explain why you turned down their proposal?
I'd like to send a fax.
"First, let's have some coffee."
It's very likely he'll come.
It'll cost around ten thousand yen.
I can't put up with that noise any longer.
"Seen from the plane, the islands were very pretty."
Do you know whether or not it'll rain tomorrow?
This room is too hot.
Our plane took off exactly at 6 p.m.
I'll give it some thought.
Tom has a tendency to jump to conclusions.
I'm afraid that I can't help you.
I had a light lunch.
Let's get started.
I don't know what this word means. I'll look it up in the dictionary.
I don't have an older sister.
He turned to the left at the corner.
Why don't you take a break?
He is the spitting image of his father.
You ought not to be cruel to animals.
It was cool in the shade of the trees.
Who is that boy?
It looks like it's going to rain. We should close the windows.
That's wrong.
Have you found the solution to the problem?
Please speak slowly.
Thank you for your purchase.
How many foreign languages do you know?
What do you say to going fishing with me?
"I'm right, aren't I?"
A lot of people are interested in camping.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
I'm used to working all night.
That's exactly what I mean.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
I'm no match for you.
Do you think we should let Tom do that?
The dog was hit by a car.
Tom has already started.
You weren't at home when I dropped by.
Just look at him.
Where can I hide?
"Now that you are eighteen, you can get a driver's license."
Tom made us some sandwiches.
"Yes, I understand."
Tom had never eaten raw fish before.
I want to go somewhere in Europe.
What tempted him to propose to her?
I can't turn the shower off. Could you check it for me?
I don't know whether to leave or stay.
Tom rushed to the window to watch the garbage truck.
"Show me your driving license, please."
My brother likes to collect stamps.
My uncle is the manager of this hotel.
Why didn't you bring your hat today?
Tom usually helps me with this kind of thing.
You don't have to go.
I was careful.
I'm going to play tennis.
Is it true you wanted to live in Boston?
Please fix this.
It's cool today for July.
I'm really good at finding four-leaf clovers.
This cheese is really delicious..
When are you going out?
Do you need a hand?
"Boy, was I wrong."
I often listen to sad songs.
The pain is getting worse.
Thank you for your letter dated January 7th.
She abandoned herself to grief.
Tom is bad at sports.
"Maybe, I'll give it a try sometime."
"I need to buy food, but I don't have enough money."
It doesn't matter to me what you think.
I'll wash the dishes.
My favorite sport is soccer.
I can't let you do that.
That old man is a fussy eater.
"Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow."
He eats a lot.
My favorite subject is math.
I'd like to live in a warmer climate.
"Bring me today's paper, please."
"Tom is very good at math, isn't he?"
You exaggerate everything.
His ideas are too radical to be acceptable to most people.
I can't stand this smell.
I started a fire right away.
Young tigers resemble cats.
It's not always easy to know a good book from a bad one.
We hope to see you again.
He had trouble breathing.
I'm sorry for calling you a liar.
I was so busy.
Are there any toilets near here?
I've climbed Mt. Fuji before.
At least you didn't get hurt.
Does Tom still have a fever?
I've caught a cold.
Tom carefully wiped his fingerprints off the knife.
He twisted my arm.
Can I open the curtain?
We keep a spare key hidden under our doormat.
Why does it have to be this way?
It isn't my fault.
Tell Tom how to get to Mary's house.
Are you still driving that car that your grandfather gave you?
Many people think that children spend too much time watching TV.
Do you have anything to say?
I've got to go now.
Would you like something to drink?
Tom unplugged the iron.
We're ready to leave.
She was engaged as an interpreter.
I'll be back in three hours.
They held a special session on trade problems.
"Recently, the number of foreigners working or studying in Japan has increased."
I don't want to run into Tom.
Everybody laughed.
Put it in the microwave.
I need a lot of cloth to make a long dress.
Tom disappointed Mary.
It's difficult to love someone when it isn't clear whether or not the other person loves you the same way.
"Heads I win, tails you lose."
There's nothing better than this.
Tom set traps to catch rabbits.
I enjoyed the movie.
What subject do you like best?
I don't understand what you're trying to accomplish.
Just look at me.
It all turned out for the best in the end.
Please wait until I come back.
Has he lived here for two years?
The moon emerged from behind the cloud.
Beware of imitations.
The result was unbelievably good.
How are things for you up there?
I have to buy mayonnaise and soy sauce.
He is very brave.
Tom was unsteady on his feet.
Please make sure that the dog doesn't go outside.
She was there in the morning.
I'll buy the tickets tomorrow.
Tom didn't know that Mary liked to cook.
I can't play guitar very well.
Keep in touch.
"Starting next week, I'll be working the late shift."
"Keep quiet, will you?"
The last three coaches of the train were badly damaged.
I see.
Tom and Mary went to a Korean barbecue restaurant.
She has beautiful handwriting.
Can't you speak English?
Don't speak with your mouth full.
He lives in a little cozy house.
"It was late, so I went home."
Are you sure you locked the door?
My watch was stolen last night.
This year the region has been hit by a severe drought.
This medicine will clear up your cold.
I think Tom might be afraid of Mary's dog.
I'm good at it.
I like it.
I'm so scared.
I've got to get back to Boston.
The train was three hours late.
Call me anytime.
This type of cat has no tail.
Tom is the most diligent student in his class.
Do it like this.
He felt his way through the darkness.
That's my younger sister's photograph.
Wow! It's been a long time.
He failed to come on time.
She's muttering something.
I couldn't answer any questions on the test.
"No, I wasn't talking to you."
The bridge was carried away by the flood.
I hope you'll soon get well.
I'll answer you tomorrow.
She sings out of tune.
This drink is on the house.
The road is closed.
You'll never know unless you try.
You managed it after all.
Tom telephoned Mary.
What have you got?
You're a slow learner.
I broke a cup yesterday.
Does this cap belong to you?
Tom isn't holding a knife. He's holding a gun.
They exchanged greetings.
He continued the experiment.
I have to write two more letters.
Does Tom know why Mary doesn't want to go to Boston with us?
I have to get my computer repaired.
Listen up.
Tom got in his pickup truck and drove off.
Don't interrupt me while I am talking.
We gave up the plan.
"If it rains, the excursion will be called off."
I'll go out and buy one as soon as I can.
You're not supposed to play baseball here.
I hate mosquitoes.
Our yard is a mess.
How come you're here?
We have a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
Do you know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
I want a few empty glasses.
Do you want money?
Tom looks a little nervous.
I know a lot about ships.
Is there any salad oil in the bottle?
Can you hear frogs croaking?
The United States was once part of the British Empire.
I can see what you're saying.
When do you close?
Tom will answer your questions.
Pardon me for coming late.
Can I extend my stay one more night?
"Since my room faces south, it isn't so cold even in the winter."
I know that Tom likes Mary.
I'll be over in half an hour.
It's possible that Tom lied to you.
Do you want some pancakes?
I'll never forget this experience.
Are you still not feeling well?
"Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died."
I was very surprised at the news.
Jobs are hard come by these days.
That movie isn't as interesting as the original.
He's a kind man at heart.
These hats are the same size.
"May I use your pencil? ""Sure go ahead."""
Do you have the key?
He's annoying.
It was unexpected.
Is it true short people need more sleep than tall people?
I must go now.
The old man stopped for a moment to rest.
I have to eat first.
"No matter where you go in Holland, you'll see windmills."
"When did you buy it? ""Let's see. I bought it last week."""
I don't write many letters.
It's just too good to pass up.
Where are the elevators?
The train was delayed because of the typhoon.
"When I arrived at the station, the train had already left."
I went home to change my clothes.
Is Tom sane?
What a rude comment!
Calm down!
"Sorry, we're full today."
How shall we deal with this problem?
I'll go to the doctor.
Would you mind my using this dictionary?
Were you two speaking French?
My father often goes to America on business.
Where did Tom get these?
I think we should reduce the price.
He walked back and forth.
I think the weather will be nice tomorrow.
Tom has done something foolish.
I hope you'll be able to come to the party.
I didn't know you used to be a professional musician.
He arrived at the station.
The park was full of squirrels.
Did you show that picture to your friends?
Can you tell silver and tin apart?
Thank you for coming.
I like strawberries very much.
Tom bought a gift for Mary.
I want you to go.
I think Tom and Mary are both sleepy.
I can't go with you. I have a meeting.
I really like dogs.
Isn't that bad?
Where can I buy books?
Did you like the movie?
We could see nothing but fog.
I don't work on weekends.
I wonder where Tom lives.
Please tell me how to get to the beach.
"Where's the key to the front door? ""In my jacket pocket."""
I can't study anywhere in my house. It's too noisy.
I forgot to open the shutter.
I may have made a mistake.
My father slept through the movie.
The smoke alarm went off.
She made fun of her husband.
No country can match France's good quality wine.
He asked her some questions.
Why did you change your avatar?
It isn't easy to speak a foreign language.
"This is a nice place, don't you think?"
This painting was very expensive.
I see.
We see them on occasion.
I did some work after breakfast and went out.
This is the end of my story.
I knew you were against it.
Are Tom and Mary coming to the party?
I heard that news on the radio.
I've lost my purse again.
Can I pay on credit?
I wouldn't say that to Tom if I were you.
Tom's parents both died while he was still a small child.
We have no choice but to trust Tom.
She smiled.
The fire is out.
Tom hid the knife under his pillow.
Tom got bullied at school.
I didn't remember his name until afterward.
Tom told Mary what he'd done.
She wore a white dress.
Where's my ring?
Would you prefer to be examined by a male nurse?
Just stick around a few days and you'll come to love this place.
He was present at the meeting yesterday.
"This is your problem, not mine."
The moon has set.
I'm lost.
She got to the other side in 30 minutes.
"I felt uncomfortable, so I went home."
I want to say one thing.
Some cars have solar panels on the roof.
Thank you for not smoking.
I don't quite believe it when I hear someone claim they can speak more than five languages fluently.
Get me some ice.
The news spread like wildfire.
Will you have some more pie?
I'd like to stay here overnight.
Let's go back.
The phone is ringing.
Will you try to play the trumpet?
It was a very traditional ceremony.
He is fortunate having such a good wife.
I loved lollipops when I was little.
"I don't know what those people are saying, but I know they're speaking French."
How much is the bus fare?
Too bad! You were almost there!
You're the only person that I can trust.
Tom is definitely up to something.
Mary and Alice are Tom's nieces.
There's no way off the island.
He is not as tall as his father.
I'm not forcing you to do anything.

Tom is Mary's husband's best friend.
He admitted his guilt.
"If something happens, call me right away."
Don't get angry.
I pulled my car to the left side of the road.
I want to do that before I die.
Let's go drinking.

I felt like I was dead.
I don't think that that changes anything.
Tom has three children now.
Did you read all of them?
The sky was full of stars.
Do you have a driver's license?
Raise your hand if you have a question.
People say that he's still alive.
I'm very hungry.
Tom knew where I was.
"He is nice, but he's not the one for me."

I felt lonely.
I think everything happens for a reason.
I think Tom is insensitive.
I had a narrow escape.
I have a lot of money.
Let's lie on the sand.
I appreciate your candor.
The main character dies at the end of the book.
Are you going to tell me about Tom or not?
I thought that a cup of coffee might make you feel better.
Is there anybody here who speaks French?
Are you crazy?
You will see the difference.
She poured tea for me.
You're not allowed to bring food into the library.
How many slices of pizza did you eat?
My family is large.
"Well, let's get going!"
Will you lend me your book?
The baby did nothing but cry.
It cannot be true.
I want to try this on.
We're a lot younger than Tom.
I believe that she has never told a lie.
Who made this cake?
"Why are you late, Tom? ""I was eating lunch."""
I slept nine hours.
What are you cooking today?
I'll be there by eight somehow.
I'm thirsty. Do you have any beer?
Lemons contain citric acid.
Do you have any food allergies?
Watch my camera for me.
I haven't had any chocolate cake in a month of Sundays.
Would you please call him back later?
A bear can climb trees.
Do you know a good restaurant?
Keep your room clean.
Kissing a smoker is like licking an ashtray.
Tom wanted to see Mary again.
It's foggy out.
I really want to learn French.
Let me pay.
That's my dictionary.
He was killed in the war.
I try.
Are you sure Tom can't understand French?
Tom still has an office in Boston.
This won't burn.
I usually get up at six.
Why are you leaving so soon?
Do you happen to know his name?
How about Monday night?
I made friends with many Americans at the party.
Tom is brushing his teeth.
We must make up for lost time.
I'm richer than Tom is.
Opportunity seldom knocks twice.
"Because of the pills I took, the pain went away."
He got up an hour early this morning.
Tom would never do that.
Didn't you see Tom?
May I trouble you to pass me the salt?
"I left home later than usual, but I was still able to catch my train."
He was worn out when he got home.
He left the last page blank.
Tom is a graduate student.
"If it were not for the sun, we could not live at all."
I cut my finger with a knife.
"In fact, he is a nice fellow."
The radio station came back on the air shortly after the storm.
He didn't need to bring an umbrella.
Are you an exchange student?
The train was crowded.
Japan does a lot of trade with Britain.
My family is a large one.
The plane is about to take off.
She was taken care of by one of her friends.
Two days passed.
I love my home country.
When did you go to bed last night?
The weather is good.
I asked Tom to drive.
It's now or never.
Is there still any sugar?
Did Tom tell you about what he saw on the news?
"It'll cost at least 2,000 yen to take a taxi."
Was it foggy yesterday?
"When I was a child, I believed in Santa Claus."
What's the horse's name?
The boy captured the bird with a net.
She buried her face in her hands.
You can't be serious.
The rice was still warm.
I should get more exercise.
Do you promise you won't tell anyone?
He wore a mask so no one would recognize him.
Could you please repeat your name?
I've got a good idea.
The classroom was so noisy I didn't hear my name called.
I got an A in French.
I heard that beer was cheaper than water in Germany. Is that true?
I'm just looking.
It isn't a Thanksgiving dinner without turkey.
I used to live in this house.
The person in question is now staying in America.
What should I change to get this to work?
Where were you guys?
The post office is that brown building.
I have to comb my hair.
A full moon can be seen tonight.
Tom has an incurable disease.
I'll smack the living daylights out of you!
He is going to school on a bus.
I like visiting places I've never been to before.
Tom started playing golf when he was thirteen years old.
"While in London, he visited the British Museum."
Come in.
I'll be sixteen on my next birthday.
Is that why you came back?
How much money do you spend a week?
She had to study hard to catch up with her classmates.
Hurry up.
Tom misses a lot of school.
The lad leaned over and shouted into Tom's ear.
He doesn't sing well.
Tom and Mary are getting married next month.
I can understand French.
Is that Tom's coat?
A dog that barks all the time doesn't make a good watch dog.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I used to play tennis in high school.
Sorry. I'm busy right now.
How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me that?
Where is the laundry?
Do you drink coffee?
Tom told me you probably know where Mary lives.
My bicycle's been stolen.
It costs three yen to make a one-yen coin.
Just be patient.
Where's the key?
I have two daughters and two sons.
Please let me do it again.
I think it would be more fun to go together.
You're barking up the wrong tree.
This noise is annoying.
"Nobody invited Tom, but he came anyway."
It seems warm outside.
Go wash your hands.
We found the stolen bag in this bush.
Your stitches will be removed in a few days.
Are you over 18?
I'll do that tomorrow if possible.
I'll come at noon to pick you up.
We climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
I had to stand in line for hours.
"No matter how hard I try, I can't remember the exact words."
Are you all set for the trip?
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Why are you here?
I'd like to go.
My little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear.
I had a puppy when I was a boy.
"Will he recover soon? ""I hope so."""
I lost my ball yesterday.
I have confidence in him.
Try your best to get there early.
I understand that this is a gamble.
I didn't realize the difference between them.
It was obvious Tom had lied.
What are you good at?
"Mary is very cute, isn't she?"
Don't kiss in public.
The rainy season begins in June.
There's many a true word spoken in jest.
I thought that Tom was Canadian.
Where are you guys going?
A lost child was sobbing at the police box.
Tom rubbed his forehead.
I can't take this anymore.
"Thanks a lot! ""My pleasure!"""
How soon does the bus leave?
Where did Tom get this?
Let's always be friends.
Was that my phone ringing?
My father gave up smoking.
Please keep this information to yourself.
Is there something that you wish to tell me?
Is this made in Switzerland?
It's my job to help people like you.
It was the happiest time of my life.
The small country is making great efforts to keep up with other developing countries.
I've had my ups and downs.
Who gave you this?
Why did you put it there?
He was learning a poem.
Do as I told you.
Tom has never ever cried.
I arrived in Tokyo at noon.
It is difficult to speak three languages.
This is a little gift for you.
Would you care for my plants while I'm away?
What's changed since then?
How did Tom win?
I've been silent for a long time.
"They sell apples, oranges, eggs, and so on."
Tom has an electric rice cooker.
Thank you for considering it.
He changed his mind.
We go fishing once in a while.
I like candlelight.
He does twenty push-ups every morning.
Are you friends with Tom?
"When I was in Tokyo, I ate sushi every day."
Are you all ready to go hiking?
I hope it'll be nice.
What he said would happen has happened.
The result was very good.
What do you want to eat for lunch?
It's no use asking him for help.
My brother is good at mathematics.
"The moment that I met Tom, I just knew that we'd get along."
Do you want to grab lunch?
She stayed there for a moment.
They are able to speak Spanish a little.
How much longer do we have to wait?
"Hurry up, or you'll miss the train."
We know that that isn't true.
My father is three years older than my mother.
He is still not accustomed to city life.
Please call us if you need anything.
May I do it right now?
There's some cheese in the fridge.
Will he come tomorrow?
He's going to get fired.
My brother gave me some pants.
Thank you just the same.
This is my favorite restaurant.
What's everyone talking about?
He hid his toys under the bed.
I feel better today.
My father is as busy as ever.
Do you remember his name?
I can't get my dress zipped up.
I saw a dog crossing the street.
"Tom is lying on the sofa, watching TV."
I heard that that boy traveled from Hokkaido to Kyushu by bicycle.
I wonder who these scissors belong to.
Could you please bring some aspirin to my room?
I got a haircut three days ago.
Would you please send this letter by airmail?
I heard someone knocking.
She is no less beautiful than her sister.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a wedding ring.
We should do away with this regulation.
Go now.
You're not going to make it in time for school.
I intend to stay at a five-star hotel.
A fish can swim.
We're pretty pleased with that.
Take it apart if necessary.
I'm so lonely.
Tom locked himself in the bathroom and started to cry.
What's the stop after Nagoya?
This is the flag of Japan.
What is the total amount?
What does Tom plan to do?
"If you permit me to speak, I can explain everything."
This library is always open.
Do you need help in the kitchen?
Are you saying it's not safe here?
Have you ever been bitten by your dog?
I sold the books.
When are you going back to Boston?
We've run out of water.
"I feel better today, but I'm not well enough to work."
You're still green.
He's standing on his head.
My husband is always reading in bed.
"At our high school, French is an elective."
"She lost her money, her family and her friends."
He is anxious to read the book.
My grandfather speaks very slowly.
He is a good swimmer.
When's Mother's Day?
Can you ski?
How is it that you are always late for school?
I come here to study.
We're like brothers.
I heard him go down the stairs.
Nobody seems to know who did that.
Is this bag Tom's?
I want to leave school.
May I talk with you in private about the matter?
Mary thought she could change Tom.
She was indignant at the way she had been treated.
"Your English is grammatically correct, but sometimes what you say just doesn't sound like what a native speaker would say."
I'm studying French grammar.
He is not always busy in the morning.
Tom said he thought I was dead.
That shirt is too large for me.
Is Tom still on the job?
I accept the statement as true.
These cars are made in Japan.
I have some stamps in my bag.
I didn't feel like dancing.
I was caught in a shower and got drenched to the skin.
How come you know French so well?
"When I'm sleepy, I sleep."
I finished my math assignment.
He is my boss.
Tom ran quickly up the stairs.
Stop joking around.
Do you think I'm fat?
That's my favorite place.
Tom plays the violin well.
My house is near the station.
I've got longer legs than Tom.
Tom taught Mary how to drive.
When can we see each other again?
Keep writing.
She was born in America.
The ice cream melted.
This side of the house catches the morning sun.
I haven't seen you for a long time.
How did you come by these rare books?
You had better ask him in advance how much it will cost.
"My father does play golf, but not well."
"How do you go to school? ""By bus."""
A large amount of money was spent on the new bridge.
Not many people will come.
He has asthma.
Tom doesn't know it yet.
The boy hugged the puppy to his chest.
Tom believes in vampires.
I'd like my coffee after the meal.
The baby started crying.
He has absolutely no respect for other people's feelings.
I got on the wrong train.
I don't know when I'll get around to visiting you.
I don't need an explanation.
They could hardly see.
I report to work at 9 o'clock every morning.
"We're Canadians, and we love our country."
Leave a space between the lines.
"Without your assistance, I would have failed."
I thought that movie wasn't very good.
Many runners passed out in the heat.
The rumor turned out to be false.
"It was raining, so I stayed home."
He arrived safely.
He has an estate in the country.
Eat what you want.
I knew you'd come.
He died at the age of seventy.
Washing clothes and sheets is my work.
I want some ice cream.
Tom's friends couldn't help him.
I have pliers in my car.
I did not notice how she was dressed.
I can't give this dictionary to anyone.
Is Tom helping Mary?
We're building a new factory not too far from here.
Did Tom eat anything?
The parents succeeded in calming him down.
Would you care for another cup of tea?
Hunger is the best spice.
That's ridiculous.
She liked him right off.
This is the wallet that I found.
It's very beautiful there in the summer.
Tom will be here in five minutes.
The police arrested the burglar.
Both you and I are men.
I think I have a gum infection.
When will you be busy tomorrow?
I'll show you my room.
You must not live beyond your means.
Tom uses honey instead of sugar.
Use it or lose it.
Strike while the iron is hot.
We stayed at a farm house.
I am a teacher.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
The word is on the tip of my tongue.
This material never wears out.
She showed me her new car.
"Even though I was sitting in the sun, I still felt chilly."
I just saw a shooting star.
"The older he grew, the more modest he became."
It takes us a long time to master a foreign language.
Tom is very knowledgeable about Japanese art.
Come to my house.
Don't drink beer before going to bed.
When are you coming here?
Where are you going today?
How long have you had this pain?
I wouldn't buy that even if I had enough money.
Thank you so much.
We turned left at the corner and drove north.
I like Tom's smile.
I locked all the doors.
They don't know what difficulties Tom went through in his youth.
I'll buy this desk for him.
Which course do you recommend?
I go to any party I am invited to.
"I wanted to see Tom, but he wasn't there."
It seems obvious that he is sick.
I have a lot of work to do.
May I enter?
I think it's unlikely that aliens similar to what we see in the movies have ever visited our planet.
Please read this book.
"Can you pass me the salt, please?"
I don't think that it's weird at all.
Where's the nearest station?
He soon grows tired of a thing regardless of how much he liked it to begin with.
Can you see the picture?
I enjoyed talking with him at the party.
Nobody knows what the future holds.
Be a good boy and eat your vegetables.
How would you like your steak?
She was obliged to give up the plan.
Everyone is different.
"Between sobs, that lost girl said her name."
When is Santa Claus coming?
Are you angry with Tom?
We should obey our parents.
He finally had to step down.
She brought me a cup of tea.
She is a selfish person.
I'm expecting my baby in the middle of January.
There's hardly any wind today.
Tom is a pushover.
The train has arrived.
I don't want to go if you don't go with me.
Tom still sometimes writes to me.
"Will you phone me later, please?"
The child has a case of chicken pox.
Love alone isn't enough for a successful international marriage.
Go for it.
I want something hot to drink.
It's two miles from here to the station.
This milk has a strange taste.
Now sit down.
Team members are provided with equipment and uniforms.
Those are my sister's books.
Please give me a definite answer.
Why don't you give your mouth a rest?
You'd better take an umbrella.
When does it end?
Show me your tongue.
What time did the plane arrive at Narita?
This church has beautiful stained glass windows.
Switzerland is a beautiful country.
I don't feel like eating out this evening.
Have you finished your preparations for the trip?
I'm afraid of bears.
Do you like dark chocolate?
"Which shirt do you like better, the red one or the blue one?"
I know that Tom is a good teacher.
I knew you'd be mad.
They rented the upstairs room to a student.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Where did you buy this tennis racket?
This is my daughter.
"If possible, I'd like to meet you tonight."
Still waters run deep.
I can't afford to keep a car.
She has a degree in biology.
Are they Japanese?
Don't move.
Tom likes going out for walks alone.
I'll go get a bucket of water.
Tom closed his speech with a beautiful song.
I went to see the baseball game yesterday.
Do you know how far it is from the station to city hall?
"While you're young, you should read a lot."
"I know that Tom dislikes me, but I don't care."
"Tom isn't your boyfriend, is he?"
My brother's in Australia now.
The explosion was so powerful that the roof was blown away.
They're useless now.
Are wakame and kombu different?
I'm going to throw up.
The team is up for the game.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
I can afford neither the time nor the money for a trip.
They are having lunch in the garden.
Tsunamis are very rare.
It is absurd to believe that young children can run faster than policemen.
I went to the store that was very nearby.
"Do you love me? ""I don't know."""
Tom said that he's been to Boston before.
Someone tapped me on the shoulder.
Thank you for rescuing us.
The professor spoke too fast for anyone to understand.
The ink stain will not wash out.
They failed the exam.
Which one do you recommend?
Keep an eye on my suitcase while I buy my ticket.
It's very interesting.
Leave it to me.
The lovers were walking arm in arm.
He rescued the child from the fire.
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Would it be OK if I took a vacation next week?
Put a dash of brandy in my tea.
Time to get up.
Tom likes sitting on the floor.
They've been on good terms with their neighbors.
I'm starving.
I have a dream.
Tom hates to get his feet wet.
He came in person.
I appreciate your advice.
Tom shed tears.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
I had met her many times before then.
Why did you think that Tom liked heavy metal?
I don't like either tea or coffee.
Is anyone hurt?
The transportation system in that city is quite good.
Tell me what to do.
Did you intend to kill Tom?
I apologize for yesterday.
Tom ate at his desk.
"No, I'm not a teacher. I'm just a student."
It's important to follow a strict diet.
That isn't my fault.
It was surprising that she said that.
I can speak English a little.
I don't feel like working today.
The house has been sold.
I speak French almost as well as I speak English.
All were silent.
Do you understand the difference?
"What time is it? ""It's 3:20."""
I've drunk three beers already.
Is this room Tom's?
You look very happy this morning.
Answer the phone.
"So long, have a good time."
I'll call you after dinner.
Don't worry about the result of your test.
It's so kind of you to come to see me off.
The box that you're looking for is in the storeroom.
I'd rather stay home than go on the school trip.
"The fog was so dense, we could hardly see anything."
Is Tom in a better mood today?
Someone has torn two pages out of this book.
Mary's husband's name is Tom.
There are lots of things I want to talk about.
Fire is always dangerous.
We've got a real blizzard going on here?
Are you looking for somebody?
Tom and Mary are a nice couple.
I worked all night.
Don't worry about that girl.
This is my father's house.
Let's ask the boy who lives next door.
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself.
"I felt uncomfortable, so I left."
I drink a glass of milk every morning.
Tom took his clothes off and put his pajamas on.
Would you like to go to a movie?
"There was no taxi, so I had to walk home."
This is gibberish.
He didn't like to ask for help even if he was starving.
Would you like to walk to the station with me?
I'd prefer not to get home until after 2:30.
It's a lot of fun playing outdoors.
What medicine do you recommend?
"It's not what he said, but the way he said it."
"Give me some water, please."
This airplane is capable of carrying 40 passengers at a time.
May I take a message?
Are you a friend of theirs?
Was anyone else injured?
Get lost!
"I'm tired, so I'm going to go to bed early."
"Shall I close the window? ""Yes, please."""
"Nowadays, we often use the term ""senior citizen"" to refer to old people."
Tom is usually quite talkative.
May I try it on?
Is this where your mother works?
I'm afraid that I'll be a burden to you.
I don't really care either way.
Tom has already sold his car.
It's terrible.
She got married against her father's will.
"Surprisingly, there are people in Japan who keep penguins as pets."
I've got Tom's address.
She talked him into buying a new house.
This is the house where she used to live.
"When I'm finished with what I'm doing, I'll come."
I know him by sight.
Don't throw things at me.
They died trying to rescue others.
Thank you for your advice.
I met my teacher on the way to the station.
The decision was postponed.
I was fined a dollar.
These are all quotations from the Bible.
"It snows there a lot, doesn't it?"
Tom is able to swim very fast.
I am going to stay here for a couple of days.
Tom is a very kind person.
He can be trusted.
You've won.
This room is big enough.
We'll go on foot.
Japan is located in the eastern part of Asia.
Iceland has a lot of volcanoes.
I was absorbed in reading a novel.
His father died after his return home.
I had a cup of coffee at the coffee shop.
I made this.
I'm 30 years old now.
It's too big.
"It wasn't my lucky day. First, I got a parking ticket and then things went from bad to worse when I got pulled over for making a U-turn."
Don't exceed the speed limit.
I'm very sorry about that.
My father made me a nice lunch.
"I am seventeen years old, too."
The cat slept on the table.
That's a good idea.
I lost the hat that I bought in Boston.
There were quite a few passengers on board the ship.
I don't believe it!
Your hair is a mess.
Don't forget to bring a pen.
It rained hard yesterday morning.
I'm going to take a quick shower.
We went to the airport to pick Tom up.
I thought that you wanted a divorce.
The city was wrapped in fog.
They are on good terms with their neighbors.
I haven't slept for several days.
Don't get an upset stomach by eating too much.
How much is this racket?
He is a golfer.
It's very cold this winter.
"Actually, I don't live far from here."
It's up to you to decide what to do.
The storm had a bad impact on the crops.
See you tomorrow.
That's it for today. We'll see you next time.
I gave my sister a pearl necklace on her birthday.
He might not be happy.
No medicine can cure a man of discontent.
You can search me!
"A glass of red wine, please."
This is going to be the hottest summer in thirty-six years.
Tom owes what he is today to his wife.
Wait one moment.
"I was tired, so I went home."
I got to Australia three days before Tom.
Would you please take a picture?
I represented my university at the conference.
This search engine is really slow.
The signal turned green.
"The other day, I bought a camera."
Give me some paper to write on.
Keep it quiet.
I lost my keys yesterday.
We should leave him alone for a while.
Why did you buy the flowers?
I'd like to have this camera.
I can't get the door to shut properly.
The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
Don't worry about us.
I can only pay 100 dollars at most.
Her first appearance on the stage was in 1969.
It's against the rules.
Tom and Mary are both fast asleep.
"In case of trouble, please call me."
It's me!
He goes to London once a month.
We could hear a foghorn in the distance.
This is the boy.
Let's get together and talk it over.
Tom wants to go abroad.
It looks like a model gun.
I can't help thinking about the future.
I studied for perhaps two hours.
My life is meaningless without you.
Tom knows Mary very well.
When will you give me your answer?
"During the performance, I was so nervous that my legs were shaking."
I heard that footprints of an abominable snowman have been discovered in the Himalayas.
So long.
I'd like to talk to you in my office.
I don't think I can eat all this.
I'm going to apply for a scholarship.
Ridiculous!
Look at the sign just ahead of you.
Do you play any sports?
John is two years older than I am.
I would like to address two questions.
The plane arrived on time.
Did you skip school yesterday?
I stretched out my legs.
Tom finally told us the truth.
I'm glad that I came to Australia.
Lightning can be dangerous.
What're you saying?
I need some money.
I know you guys are friends.
I have a black eye.
I don't think that we'll make it on time.
This is strange.
The day is sure to come when your dream will come true.
Are you responsible for this mess?
Can you wait?
Are you aware of any problems?
I've always wanted to try this.
"This summer, I plan to read every book on these three shelves."
We finished the job at noon.
Nobody came.
"How are you feeling this morning? ""Pretty good, thanks."""
What are you doing there?
You should stay in bed for three or four days.
Is this Tom's bag?
We admired the beauty of the scenery.
I am Tom.
"He shouted, ""Get out!"""
He drinks a lot of milk every day.
Black phones are more expensive than white ones.
That is a good idea.
May I turn the radio off?
Tom is wearing glasses with black frames.
I'm not as influential as you think I am.
I wanted to make some telephone calls.
Phone me later.
I'm looking forward to the concert.
I was very hurt.
"I went to the movie thinking that it would be fun, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth."
I expressed my thanks.
He's very good at playing baseball.
Tom stopped talking when Mary walked into the room.
"Those are cheap, aren't they?"
"Because I don't have children, I can spend more time volunteering than parents can."
This tree is too young to bear fruit.
She loves coffee.
"Every time I read the Bible, I am deeply moved."
Candy is bad for your teeth.
I want to live here for the rest of my life.
I'll be back in an hour.
"Tom's annual income is more than $100,000."
You must go home at once.
Those pants are too big.
Everyone has faults.
I'm busy at the moment.
Please keep this secret.
Is there something you'd like to do?
I seized the cat by the neck.
I would like to try this dress on.
He lives in a large house by himself.
It was raining heavily when I got up this morning.
There is too much furniture in this room.
How many days will it take?
January 1st is a day when many Japanese go to the shrine.
"If there's anything I need, I'll ask."
We will talk over the matter later.
Congratulations!
I had a big lunch today.
Is it going to rain?
"So, did you get kissed?"
I'm not that stupid.
I stayed up late last night reading a novel.
Tom doesn't listen.
I saw a boy get hit by a car.
It's nice to meet you.
Please develop this film.
Could you please speak a little slower?
"In Japan, the new school year begins in April."
I was really upset.
The girls were sitting side by side.
Tom and Mary often talk to each other using Skype.
I've been as busy as a bee for the past two months.
My wife is a doctor.
The moon came out from behind the cloud.
Should we get up earlier?
I'm sorry I have no pencil to write with.
Two people riding on a bicycle at the same time is dangerous.
Tom just now got home.
Please tell me what you think.
I should've called Tom before I went to see him.
It had been snowing for a week.
When did you hear the sound?
I prefer walking to riding.
She was aching all over.
I'm leaving.
What time does school begin?
Did you turn off the heater?
"How do you like your coffee, with or without sugar?"
He likes to read books.
Do you have the keys?
Are you the one who called the police?
Whose house is across from yours?
Please close the door.
Tom fought.

Let's stop talking about this.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
This is really delicious.
That's a book.
My children had eaten all the cookies by the time I got home.
You never can tell what might happen if Tom meets Mary.
Three years have passed since he died.
Run.
The picture is true to life.
I have to go now.
Is it true that you kissed Tom?
I feel nothing but contempt for such behavior.
Three students made short speeches and introduced themselves and their countries.
There's nothing in the refrigerator.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
They got married on Christmas Eve.
He participated in the debate.
"Fortunately, nobody died."
Why don't you want to go home?
She went to the market to buy fresh vegetables.
I can't be in two places at the same time.
He acknowledged it to be true.
My neighbor's dog often comes into our yard.
Tom opened the safe.
"Between sobs, that lost girl said her name."
Christmas is rapidly approaching.
The rain shows no sign of stopping.
Tom was the first person to enter the cave.
Do you know this man?
Camels have either one or two humps.
He is bound to make a fortune.
Please tell the chef it was delicious.
No way!
He left home early in the morning so he wouldn't miss the train.
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
I'm afraid it's not a good idea.
Her anxiety almost drove her wild.
It looks like it'll be clearing up.
I give my mother a birthday present every year.
I've already removed your name from the list.
I happened across an old friend in the street.
He set off to Paris.
My brother and I shared the room.
Is Tom dangerous?
He's good at mathematics.
"If I were you, I'd buy it."
That's hard to say.
He betrayed his country.
What is love?
That's not my favorite topic.
Were you alone all week?
Dentists take X-rays to examine your teeth.
The children looked bored.
I don't go for men of his type.
Tom isn't smiling.
Statistics show that the population of the world is increasing.
A thousand meters is one kilometer.
I don't like her.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
Tom weighs more than I do.
This definitely tastes better than what we ate yesterday.
Does Tom play football?
Tom isn't a designer.
Do whatever you want to do.
"No, I can't do that."
What is the cat up to?
The wind has died down.
Have your own way.
What are you planning to make for dinner?
I pretended to cry.
I wonder whether Tom will come tomorrow.
Let's not get carried away.
Mother Teresa was born in Yugoslavia in 1910.
I bought a camera for 30 dollars.
He is old enough to drive a car.
Tom was in the shower.
He accidentally hit his thumb with the hammer.
Don't fail to mail this letter.
You still have much to learn.
I don't think you need that much money to buy what you need.
He walked slowly so the children would be able to follow.
"I don't mean to be unsociable, but I'm tired."
I can't do this work alone.
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
Why didn't you have breakfast?
Who's your favorite movie star?
You drink too much.
They formed themselves into a circle.
He held his breath for a moment.
I don't like to speak in public.
I couldn't leave right away because I had something I had to do.
I've made some changes to my resume.
I didn't understand the meaning.
Stay away from that.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary wanted him to do.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
We need to scrub the floor.
The baseball game was called off due to rain.
Don't talk to me now.
I like this watch.
Smile.
Take care not to catch a cold.
I stayed up late last night.
School will open on Monday.
What's in fashion in Paris?
Two hundred houses were burnt down in the fire which broke out yesterday.
I appreciate you coming here.
Can I leave now?
He was very old.
Throw the ball.
"At that time, Tom was in Boston."
"Will it rain tomorrow? ""I hope not."""
"I'm the one you're waiting for, I think."
That bridge is made of stone.
Tom is particular about what he eats.
She had nothing to do yesterday.
"This tape recorder was 40,000 yen."
Isn't it true?
The French president is scheduled to visit Japan next month.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
I trust him.
A few days' rest will do you good.
Several children are playing on the sandy beach.
This is the same car that was left at the scene of the crime.
There is a river beside the house.
Tom said that he'd like to visit Australia.
Set it down there.
You must prepare yourself for the worst.
He ran away with the money.
That handbag is mine.
People are clearly fed up.
Is it OK if I turn off the light?
My sister married one of her high school classmates.
I'm not always free on Sundays.
It's hard to believe anything you say.
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
That store sells many things besides furniture.
What does this word mean?
I bought a slow cooker.
That's disappointing.
Washing clothes is my work.
You won.
I felt as if my life had been shortened.
Paris is in France.
Tom got soaked and caught a cold.
The airplane ascended into the clouds.
Tom sat up slowly.
She has a daughter named Mary.
I found the credit card I thought I'd lost.
Tom and Mary fight constantly.
I'll send my mother a letter.
I was disappointed.
Looks like I might have to burn the midnight oil tonight.
Is there a bank near the train station?
She helped her brother out with his picture.
He seems tired.
Did you vomit?
"Could you pass me the salt, please?"
We have to rent a room for our party.
Her hat looked very funny.
How much do you think this suitcase weighs?
Are they still angry?
Did you order this?
You may sit wherever you like.
I fell in love with her the moment I met her.
Are you good at math?
My father will support me financially.
She looked at him angrily.
She's dieting.
He has access to the American Embassy.
"Sooner or later, Tom will master French."
Don't be a copycat.
I want to travel around Australia by car.
I think the soup needs a bit of salt.
Tom is definitely bald.
Why did you decide to study French?
He excused himself for his bad behavior.
Nothing seems to grow in this soil.
She knows many proverbs.
He took off his coat.
When was the last time you ate a pomegranate?
"I think Tom didn't do that yesterday, but I'm not sure."
Tom and Mary built their own house.
Tom hired a lawyer.
It looks as if it is going to rain.
I want to ask you something.
I heard the news on the radio.
I don't get it.
It isn't a difficult problem.
No one could solve the puzzle.
I got hurt today.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
That may be true.
The Titanic sunk on its maiden voyage.
I know your older brother quite well.
Do you sell batteries?
Tom sat on a chair.
It's ideal weather for a picnic.
Don't hesitate to ask a question if you don't understand.
"I tried to be calm, but finally I lost my temper."
When did you buy that?
It's hot today.
I think that it's possible.
I'm happy to see you again.
There was a storm the day before yesterday.
Don't work too hard.
They're eating sandwiches.
Now I remember.
What did you do at night?
You have no right to oppose our plan.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
It's not that far to the airport.
Thank you for your time.
What time will you have breakfast?
I was with Tom last night.
The priest blessed the marriage of the happy couple.
October twentieth is Tom's birthday.
What time do you turn the lights off?
I'll just go for a walk to clear my head.
I've decided to keep doing that.
Tom can't do that.
The clock's ticking.
He lived a hard life.
I just need to find Tom.
Nobody here knows my name.
I don't want to go bald while I'm still young.
I want to know how I can gain weight.
Tom is wearing a name tag.
Do you like kids?
It happened that the day was my birthday.
I bought a pair of leather shoes.
Do you require our help?
You must not enter the room.
How did you guys meet?
There was no furniture in the room.
You're supposed to always pay your rent on the first of the month.
Don't be late for school tomorrow.
They acclaimed him their leader.
Show me what's in your hand.
Tom is waiting at the gate.
I hear he was released after five years in prison.
It's fun playing football after school.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
I need a couple of empty cardboard boxes.
Would three o'clock be OK?
I got up about six.
People don't like to swim against the tide.
I'm not saying Tom is to blame.
"How are you doing? ""Not bad."""
"She spoke too quickly, so I couldn't understand."
Tom wasn't able to do everything he had to do.
Happy birthday!
Take as much as you like.
"When Kawazoe pinned me down at the meeting, I broke out in a cold sweat."
"Honestly, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher."
I haven't paid for my ticket yet.
I recommend going by train.
I don't feel like talking to anybody.
My mother teaches flower arranging.
I like this one better.
Keep still.
Please tell me your name and telephone number.
"Today, at the pool, Tom jumped into the water from the ten-meter platform for the first time."
"Tom's annual income is more than $100,000."
What time does the next train bound for Tokyo leave?
I'll wait at the bus stop.
He can't be older than I am.
Please tell me what I should do first.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
He writes letters to his mother.
Tom slipped out of the classroom.
"Daddy, let's make faces at each other and see who can keep from laughing the longest."
A brewery we finance has made a new sweet sake and brought some to us asking us to try it.
Don't scare the girls.
There has to be another way to do this.
How can I update this software?
Do you want my email address?
I'm a bit tired.
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.
Why does Tom need my help?
Not a single star could be seen in the sky.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
Listen to me carefully.
I am very glad to see you.
You know I'm married.
Whose turn is it?
I left the store disappointed.
Why did Tom have to do that?
I am a college student.
I just asked because I thought that you would know.
I eat bread every day.
She was moved to tears by the story.
I'm glad I could be of service.
Don't worry about what others say.
"I ate ice cream, too."
How are you?
Your French pronunciation is terrible.
I would like to ask a favor of you.
You're a liar.
Do you have any foreign books?
Tom's hands are bigger than mine.
I like that sweater.
"I'm still young, too."
He told us an interesting story.
I'm seriously considering getting married.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Don't worry.
Why can't you come?
"I have a fever, so I'm taking today off."
I don't see anything.
I wish I had had a camera then.
I substitute honey for jam.
He accepted my present.
We are giving Tom a party on his birthday.
"You know who I am, don't you?"
I bought these flowers for you.
These are the basics.
We will take care of this for you.
Tom can play tennis very well.
It's getting dark.
Cats hate to get wet.
Turn right at the end of that street.
It was a very pleasant afternoon.
My father bought the book for me.
Who designed the White House?
The bus is here.
My car is older than you are.
That's ridiculous.
I want to be able to write as beautifully as Tom.
I was living in Boston a few years ago.
I want a box three times as large as this.
"A beer, please."
I could swim well when I was a child.
Help me find someplace I can stay.
Tom is so full of himself.
Tom has finished eating.
Take care of yourself.
Either day would be all right with me.
See you again.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I don't agree with either of you.
"Tea, please."
I left it unlocked.
"Take this medicine, and you'll feel better."
I haven't spoken with anyone today.
"Frankly speaking, I hate him."
What movies do you want to see this summer?
Tom used to live in Boston.
"The concert was short, but it was really good."
Your name was on the list.
It looks like those two have made up.
I wonder if Tom is coming to Boston next weekend.
I am not getting involved.
Will you give me a sip?
What on earth are you doing here?
You don't look very well. You had better not go to work today.
Somebody's waiting for you outside.
I just wanted to see what would happen.
"We have lots of questions, too."
Tom was very depressed.
I didn't do the homework.
Somebody help me.
I want to walk a little slower.
I do a lot of worrying.
It is impossible to read her handwriting.
This plan is currently under consideration.
I like that a lot.
Nothing tastes as good as the food that you make.
They said that they didn't eat meat.
Go home.
Why did Tom commit suicide?
I want you to tell me what happened.
You may choose what you like.
Modern finance is becoming increasingly complicated and sophisticated.
Are your parents going to be home tonight?
Many people think children don't spend enough time playing outside.
Take care not to turn the box upside down.
We need more workers.
"Last year, it snowed a lot."
"At last, the baby fell asleep."
I've read three books since this morning.
I usually get up late.
I have a bad feeling.
It would be good to make a backup immediately.
Tom felt someone tap him on the shoulder.
I'm a little annoyed.
It's an old Japanese movie.
Tom is the breadwinner in this family.
Are you sure Tom is coming?
I'll meet you at three o'clock tomorrow.
I shave every morning.
Tom said he thought that I looked bored.
The ball bounced over the wall.
I'll lend you one if you like.
I am Japanese.
Were you the one who closed the door?
He proceeded to the next question.
It looks like rain.
I've dealt with this store for years.
We need to hurry.
She looked as though she had seen me somewhere before.
He works us too hard.
I awoke to find myself lying on the floor.
You'd better do it at once.
He has more books than he can ever read.
We're going to the movies.
I don't like it when it's very hot.
I think this is the only way to get rid of cockroaches.
I know that you're busy.
"Do you think it'll rain? ""No, I don't think so."""
You are always complaining.
I graduated last year.
"Where have you been? ""I have been to the station to see a friend off."""
"If you are not going to the concert, then neither am I."
Are you going to cut down all the trees?
The teacher excused me from the examination.
That's Tom's.
Tom was caught in the rain and his new suit got ruined.
The company deals in a variety of products.
I'm a banker.
This plan might work.
Could you please tell me your room number?
I thought that Tom had a day off.
This is the way he learned English.
My father works for a bank.
My little brother never helps around the house.
Tom doesn't like me.
He always keeps his room as neat as a pin.
I confessed.
The room charge is $100 a night plus tax.
Tom currently works for his father's company.
I'll speak slowly.
Tom broke his ankle when he tripped.
I'm Tom.
I think there has been some misunderstanding here.
What did she say?
You should thank Tom.
Is it OK to smoke around here?
I'd like you to translate this report into French.
Would you mind picking up something on the way back?
My brother has never climbed Mt Fuji.
Keep off the grass.
It's expensive though.
Can you open the door for me?
She hired him as a programmer.
You're free to use this room.
It's a little too complicated for me.
I would act differently in your place.
He can swim on his back.
I think I've told you this before.
I think you can get that.
Life is hard. Death is easy.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
Let's take a ten-minute break.
That was less interesting than I thought it would be.
I've already finished reading this book.
Do you know what time it is in Boston?
No one talks that way in real life.
The sky was filled with stars.
This apple tastes sour.
Tom had to return to Boston.
I'll order this later.
"I wanted to help you, but Tom told me not to."
"The more time you spend talking about what you do, the less time you have to do it."
Japan is a country that is completely surrounded by oceans.
He is as good as any player on our team.
I know Tom could do that.
The instant I saw him I knew he was angry.
I left it unlocked.
The moon shone brightly.
This problem is a real challenge.
I'm aware that you failed.
I will make you happy.
"If a man had 11 sheep and all but 9 died, how many sheep would he have left?"
I got an IV at the hospital.
I had breakfast at seven-thirty.
We're sunk.
You look very happy.
I think Beethoven is the greatest composer who ever lived.
I'm not a robot.
He stood on the edge of the cliff.
I don't think she is fit for the job.
I prefer tennis to baseball.
I like your apartment.
We haven't seen each other for such a long time.
You can leave the room now.
Does he go to school by bus?
I didn't remember her.
I'm not sure that'll work.
Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard.
"Do you have the key? ""Yes, I have it."""
I'll go look for that.
I don't have enough RAM.
I'll go out after having dinner.
He likes tigers.
I'm not interested at all.
I have to do this alone.
I told him to leave the room.
They raised their glasses and toasted to their success.
It is not as good as it looks.
Do you want to be my friend?
I received an item that I did not order.
He is married with two children.
I put some cream in my coffee.
Do you mind if I smoke here?
Look. There's a plum tree.
"It isn't snowing, is it?"
I know you're shocked.
He is standing on the hill.
I really respect Tom.
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
"She was born at six a.m. on July 17, 1990."
"It's not Tom's ability, but his character that is at issue."
Have more confidence in yourself.
I will have him come here the day after tomorrow.
He searched for the key.
I hate carrots.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
"Speech is silver, silence is gold."
Tom and Mary said they'd rather do it alone.
We have a cat and a dog.
My dog isn't that big.
"A cup of coffee, please."
I took a bus so I wouldn't be late for my appointment.
"I appreciate it, but I think I shouldn't."
"In all my travels, I've never seen a more beautiful mountain than Mount Everest."
Where are you going?
There is no point in pretending to be sick.
Tom died a few weeks ago.
Are these all the same price?
I can hardly work now.
Can I go to work?
I couldn't think of anything.
The clock says two.
Will you have some more tea?
It was really muggy.
Let's have tea at 3:00.
Let's not do the work.
I came to Australia to look for work.
Motorcycles are very cheap.
Please take your hat off.
It's a nice day.
Don't you think it's rather warm for December?
Tom was here before sunrise.
I have to be absent from school for the moment.
I didn't eat breakfast this morning.
Tom needed some food.
"Since the war, Japan has advanced greatly in science and technology."
Why don't we eat pizza for lunch today?
I'll go for a walk.
I am not cut out to be a politician.
I thought you understood.
That's a lie.
Please listen carefully.
Which brand do you prefer?
I would like you to leave immediately if possible.
Have you ever done any volunteer work?
My grandfather gave me a birthday present.
Who do you think will win?
"If you have a better idea, I'm all ears."
It won't last long.
Are there special evening rates?
"Having seen him before, I recognized him."
A gentle wind was blowing.
Tom likes Mary.
I'm tired.
She met him for breakfast.
Nobody knows the truth.
It's two-thirty.
Tom and Mary live in an old castle.
"Just close your eyes, whispered Tom, and when Mary closed her eyes, he kissed her softly on the lips."
Take this medicine after each meal.
Would you like coffee or tea?
His novel is beyond my comprehension.
Thanks for caring.
Miniskirts have gone out of fashion.
Is your password really your birthday?
It was yesterday that I went.
"At times, it snows even in April around here."
"By the way, how many children will be going?"
I've taken you off the list.
Those shoes are a perfect match for this white skirt.
Can I leave a message?
That company is managed by a foreigner.
I'm not worried about that in the slightest.
How did you meet your wife?
Wait a minute.
"She looks young, but actually she's older than you are."
Dinner is almost ready.
Why is nobody visiting my website?
He came about two.
Tom put on his sunglasses.
"As the proverb says, ""Time is money."""
"Tom hadn't washed clothes in a long time, so he searched through his dirty clothes to see if there was something clean enough to wear."
What does this stand for?
It has been almost 50 years since World War II ended.
I'd rather stay home than go fishing.
It rained for three days on end.
My phone is always on mute.
Come over here.
You've made the very same mistake again.
I must go there.
It was such a shock.
We lost sight of them over half an hour ago.
This song is really cool.
Tom only had three dollars with him.
Will you let me at it?
My mother made me a white dress.
Mind your manners.
We can't drink milk.
There are a lot of tall buildings in New York.
I attended the meeting though my father told me not to.
"Don't pour hot water into a glass, or it may crack."
She hit him with a hammer.
Where's your home?
Only Tom can do that.
The media has a lot of influence on the outcome of an election.
I'd prefer not to do that now.
I stayed in bed all day.
Tom gave Mary the picture.
My water bottle is empty.
Could you help me for just a minute?
I was deeply moved by his speech.
Tom has a little brother.
Is Tom always here on Mondays?
Could you keep it down? I'm trying to study.
Where can I see a football game?
Don't write in ink.
Please remove your hats.
It was obvious that the driver had not been careful enough.
You can stay with us for the night.
I do not have a cat.
I'm starving.
"He got up quickly, splashed cold water on his face, brushed his teeth and shaved."
I haven't met him before.
I didn't think you'd get here so soon.
He returned at six.
The car is waxed and shining.
May I sit here?
You shouldn't eat anything spicy.
"Hold on, please."
What I want now is hot coffee.
A blood vessel burst inside his brain.
Would you like a ride?
I don't want to hurt his feelings.
Are you deaf?
May I ask your name?
You may as well stay where you are.
Today is our school field day.
"If my wife calls, just tell her I'm in an important meeting and cannot be disturbed."
Tom was smiling from ear to ear.
"It's interesting, isn't it?"
"Today, automobiles have taken the place of horses as the principal means of transportation."
I don't know how to play hide-and-seek.
I've known Tom a long time.
Would you like to be a writer?
I just wanted to sleep.
I don't remember the next part of the dream.
I wonder whether Tom is able to understand French or not.
We have a big dog.
Is Tom a good kisser?
You will stay at home.
You look busy.
That lake looks like an ocean.
"Large, isn't it?"
You ought to stop smoking.
We are men.
I feel as if we've already met.
I have known him since he was a baby.
Do you mind if I join you?
The apple trees blossomed early this year.
I left.
I heard a call for help.
A cat has nine lives.
I'm going to give you one more chance.
I'll be there at once.
Tom's window was open.
I try not to eat anything after dinner.
I am in the house.
Tom told Mary to go home.
I'll buy a pen for Tom.
I'm going to lock the door.
Tom was late for dinner.
Can I see that one?
The bursting of Japan's so-called bubble economy sent shock waves through international markets.
Your father is proud of you.
Don't make me laugh.
That's unusual.
Twenty police have arrived on the scene.
"Once you've decided when you'll be coming, let me know."
"He said he did not know the man, which was a lie."
No one had a flashlight.
"On the other side of the park, there's a beautiful river."
Tom took a shower before breakfast.
How can I reach you?
Tom contacted Mary.
We felt the house shake a little.
Does Tom teach French?
I suspect Tom and Mary are lost.
Have you ever milked a cow?
Tom tossed the ball to Mary.
Get me all the information you can on this matter.
"We have the extra-large size, but not in that color."
Do you think it'll rain this weekend?
I can't imagine that Tom will get here on time.
Both of them are from Boston.
"Since it was cold, we made a fire."
Let me know if you can't make it in time.
When's the big day?
There's an interesting article in this magazine about education problems.
Tom is my younger sister's husband.
Tom tried to wash the blood off his clothes.
I don't like summer.
I'm too excited to eat anything.
I felt very awkward.
The clock stopped.
Don't walk so fast.
"See you later, everyone."
It's now 3:00 a.m. in Japan.
My father has been dead for three years.
"As far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the plan."
Keep the money in a safe place.
I don't drink alcohol.
Which house did you live in?
I couldn't make out what he was saying.
He hunted for his missing cat all day.
There are many reasons.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
I don't believe anything that Tom says.
The conference drew 150 diplomats.
Swimming at night is dangerous.
Where are the restrooms?
You can do that.
Shall I have him call you?
I'm an Olympic medalist.
Can I have some scratch paper?
Stay close to Tom.
I waited by myself in front of the hotel.
Hold still a moment while I fix your tie.
"It's hot, so be careful."
"Insofar as we know, he is guilty."
I've kept a diary for three years.
Do you want rice?
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Did you live here?
My turn comes next.
There were two children playing on the street.
You've got to wait.
How many people live on this island?
I haven't been sleeping well recently.
I like it very much.
The tornado destroyed the whole village.
"If it's raining, we don't plan to go hiking."
Mary is a working mom.
He added to his savings.
"Help me, please."
I had lunch with Tom yesterday.
I don't have much faith in his ability.
My parents told me that we should respect the elderly.
How do I eat this?
This coat fits you.
I need a bag. Will you lend me one?
Could I borrow your phone?
The room is cluttered with newspapers.
That seems like a personal problem.
He is a friendly person.
Take off your socks.
Tom is my brother-in-law.
Don't play with the key.
I want to make new friends.
Cats like to play in the sun.
You must take care not to break it.
Yesterday my father caught three fish.

There is very little hope of his success.
Driving a car is a lot of fun.
I was fortunate to escape unharmed.
Tom and Mary stayed at a fancy hotel.
This apple is sweet.
Do you accept this card?
I wonder whether both Tom and Mary have left.
"Even though we were supposed to meet at 10, I've had no contact with them. I wonder if they've had an accident."
I got the ticket for nothing.
I thought that that went well.
The stream is not very swift.
I've had enough.
The tower is three hundred and twenty-one meters high.
You should quit drinking and smoking.
We got on the bus there.
He had almost no formal education.
Please let me know the truth.
My wife died in 2013.
You have absolutely no fashion sense.
This coffee tastes bitter.
She has never fallen in love.
I first used a computer about 40 years ago.
Santa Claus knows whether you're naughty or nice.
Education does not consist simply in learning a lot of facts.
Nuclear weapons are a threat to all humanity.
I like jazz.
Tom didn't know all the facts.
Mary's kitchen is bigger than my living room.
Let me help you with the dishes.
The tall man looked at Tom and smiled.
Tom doesn't have any brothers and sisters.
Mary is older than her husband.
My sister plays the piano every day.
"For the record, we're just friends."
Can I kiss you?
We'll talk to Tom later.
There's a lot of snow in the winter.
Could I please have one more can of beer?
Do you have a favorite actor?
I'd like to hear more about that.
I don't think that we can do this.
The court acquitted him of the charge of murder.
Do you object to my idea?
How long do you think we'll have to wait?
I have to go to the library.
Tom still doesn't know about Mary's death.
Is it too much?
Is it OK if I leave my homework here?
Keep an eye on my bag for a while.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
I've noticed that.
Did you forget?
Beware of pickpockets here.
Tom scored the game-winning goal.
Twenty teams entered the tournament.
I wonder if Tom likes Mary.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
There are still a lot of things to do.
I'm alone.
Look out for bees.
He's a mere child.
This is a very quiet room.
You can do it.
I want to sleep in my own bed tonight.
I'd prefer a hotel that's close to the airport.
I'm just sleepy.
Most salmon die after spawning.
"Hey, long time no see."
Tom flatly refused.
Could someone hand me a knife?
I took a cab to the station.
"If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home."
Have you already had breakfast?
He looked left and right.
This desk is as good as that one.
I'm sorry. I'm a stranger around here.
She is a charming and reliable person.
That's not very important to me.
I don't put sugar in my tea.
There are no food stores in the immediate area.
My mom wants me to study in Switzerland.
It rained for three days on end.
It may rain in the evening.
Most students study hard.
Put the book where you found it.
How long are you going to stay here?
I don't know which is better.
Who'll go?
Mind your own business!
Would you please wait for a few minutes?
I haven't yet visited Boston.
We hired Tom yesterday.
Tom told me he didn't have a passport.
That's a little unfair.
It's not a joke.
Is this OK?
I think that Tom was impressed with your work.
Where can we buy the things we need?
I wish I could give up smoking.
It's not anyone's fault.
He lives with his parents.
This is it.
We've had a poor crop due to lack of water.
I have nothing to do with this matter.
He succeeded in solving the problem.
I have a friend waiting for me in front of the library.
Where did you buy these shoes?
I don't speak French fluently.
Do you spend more time with your friends or with your family?
Is that real?
The climate here is mild.
"For me, it was a special day."
Our university has a dormitory.
I took the radio apart to repair it.
Please wait a little while.
The coffee was so hot that I had to sip it.
My sister is engaged in social work.
I need to get a new pair of glasses.
"Don't worry, I'll help you."
Can you drive?
It's improved.
Tom left.
I'd like to join the club.
Japan produces a lot of good cameras.
Someone called.
I think you'd better take a break.
Is this seat taken?
Are those buses air-conditioned?
That's so silly.
What is his name?
I don't like hitchhiking.
I had been in Tokyo only three days when I received news of my father's death.
Your lips are turning blue.
I don't like people who are stupid.
My stomach hurts.
What are you laughing at?
That plan was unsuccessful.
The old man lived by himself.
Is that bike Tom's?
"Due to the bad weather, the game was called off."
The couple was walking arm in arm.
Do you want a pretzel?
I saw my mother hide the cake.
Call me if anything changes.
She seated herself on the bench.
Is Tom always here on Monday?
This is the place where my father was born.
"I'd like to hold a staff meeting first thing tomorrow afternoon, so could you reserve the conference room?"
We're getting married in October.
I think that you should do it yourself.
Please speak more loudly.
Please telephone me before you come.
Tom tried to translate a book into French.
Save me some ice cream.
It isn't broken.
I shouldn't have done it.
It's very close to the station.
Tom's cheeks were bright red.
I married young.
Give me something to drink.
"The Hilton Hotel, please."
Tom comes here every single day.
Did Tom have school today?
It isn't easy to catch a rabbit with your bare hands.
Tom has a cat.
"Could I have a subway map, please?"
Put out the light.
This bed is too hard to sleep on.
Whose guitar is this?
I want to listen to Japanese music.
I don't know what I'm going to tell Tom.
There's a difference between silly and stupid.
Tom said that he was hungry.
Tell us what to do.
I don't like men like that.
What time did you close the store last night?
Are you freaking kidding me?!
I want you to meet my cousin.
She disapproved of my trip to Vienna.
"He said he would give me a call, but he hasn't yet."
My car was damaged in a hit-and-run accident in a supermarket parking lot yesterday.
I thought Tom had gotten over Mary.
The doctor told me I had a concussion.
Can I use a calculator?
I'm skeptical when I hear someone claim to speak more than five languages fluently.
I found it difficult to walk in the deep snow.
"Some people like classical music, while others like popular music."
The students presented their teacher with a gold watch.
It is important that you attach your photo to the application form.
Don't talk.
Where's the rest of your money?
I thought that book was difficult to read.
It might rain tomorrow.
Please be here by eight at the latest.
Tom and I decided to go to Australia together.
The boy who had been missing was identified by his clothes.
I woke up late yesterday.
I've left that line of business.
She spoke with tears in her eyes.
I have three cats.
Is that so difficult?
Don't fix it if it ain't broke.
Tom was dismissed from his job.
This glass contains water.
The professor treated her as one of his students.
I have a great deal to do today.
The traveler reached his destination at last.
Please don't turn up the volume on the television.
Why are you so ugly?
I thought I told you to trim your beard.
The drama on TV was so popular that it stirred up people's interest in the period.
Let's go right away.
I can't decide which to choose.
She stared at him in astonishment.
I've never eaten anything as delicious as this.
I can't see anything except water.
This is my house key.
You're not as young as me.
"Tom was injured, but not too seriously."
Tom speaks French fluently.
When will you visit me again?
Tom likes animals more than people.
The match ended in a draw.
Did Tom tell you where he bought it?
Do you wear a kimono?
You may choose any book you like.
Tell her which train she should get on.
I know what I've got to do.
Welcome home.
Are your bags packed?
He was exiled to an island for the crime of high treason.
Tom didn't bring his keys.
"If you press this button, the window opens automatically."
We were faced with an unusual situation because of the accident.
Do you follow?
The baseball season opens before long.
I hope that neither of them was involved in the traffic accident.
She sat beside me in church.
"If you don't plant the seeds, they won't grow."
"If you have something to say, just say it."
Milk is nutritious.
They had nothing to eat.
"You're upset with me, aren't you?"
"I didn't eat anything for breakfast, so I'm really hungry right now."
I can recommend this restaurant.
Your daughter's a beautiful girl.
"My father rarely, if ever, goes out on Sundays."
We should obey the traffic rules.
Is Tom really busy?
Is there anything special you want?
I read this book when I was in elementary school.
Tom could tell that Mary was bored.
It was her wish to go to Paris.
The prisoners tried to escape.
When does the next train leave?
He lives in the western part of town.
Let's swim over there.
"For Hawking, writing this book was not easy."
Have you ever dated?
You had no way of knowing that would happen.
An enemy of an enemy is not necessarily an ally.
Tom took the clock apart.
She didn't visit anybody.
I like the way you walk.
Can somebody tell me why Tom is angry?
It seems warm outside.
The result is all that matters.
Could you translate this sentence?
Don't let anyone come near the fire.
I wondered if I'd ever really understood anyone.
You're tallest.
He chased the thief.
"Even though he has a lot of money, he's not happy."
I want to work at my own pace.
You need to be here by 2:30 at the latest.
"Tom likes Mary, but Mary likes John. To make matters even more interesting, John likes Alice, but Alice likes Tom."
Do you know the difference between a microscope and a telescope?
The flight was canceled because of the heavy fog.
I dreamed about you last night.
What's the biggest difference?
How dare you say such a thing!
I had a good time at the party.
Tom said no such thing.
I can't believe Tom made such a mistake.
I'm awake.
The Pacific Ocean is one of the five oceans.
Where have you been the past couple of days?
I climbed Mt. Fuji.
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
How much do you feed your dog?
I just wanted to see her.
"Africa is a continent, but Greenland isn't."
Tom was irritated.
He has four mobile phones.
Tom said that Mary was single.
Have confidence. You can do it.
"If you get up early tomorrow, you can see the rising sun."
Cauliflower and broccoli are similar.
I wonder why karaoke is so popular.
"My family consists of my father, mother, and sister."
Tom brought some food.
"If you have the time, come along with me."
The moon is the earth's only satellite.
I would like to buy some aspirin.
He hasn't been here long.
If only the doctor had come a little sooner.
I'm getting married to her in June.
I don't have much time right now.
Tom always helps us.
My house is big.
I'm not scared anymore.
There was nothing in the basket.
He is an unpleasant fellow.
I'd like to know when you can send it out.
It's hard to say.
A bright idea occurred to me.
Don't you want to come along?
He has gone to Osaka on urgent business.
Tom didn't say anything about why he was late.
She has gone to the United States.
I forgot to turn off the gas!
Is it a compliment or an insult?
We took turns driving on the way to Boston.
The majority of large Japanese companies depend on exports.
We've lived in this town since 1960.
It was raining good and hard.
"It's very easy to sound natural in your own native language, and very easy to sound unnatural in your non-native language."
I was there for three hours.
Smoking is bad for your health.
"It may seem like Tom has forgotten all about the matter, but deep down inside, he's still torn up about it."
My older sister takes a shower every morning.
I've just finished lunch.
Do you have vertigo?
I'm to meet Tom at 2:30.
I'm not going to tell you.
"She asked him why he was crying, but he didn't answer."
I come back home at 6:30.
This is an opera in five acts.
Tom is a coward.
My sister is playing with a doll.
"So far, so good."
Tom's house is near the sea.
Please visit me tomorrow.
You're a good tennis player.
We heard several explosions in the distance.
I was uncertain whether to advance or to retreat.
What do you think of my new dress?
Have you done all your homework?
We should go there together.
I could hardly resist laughing.
Yesterday it was so cold that I stayed in the house.
I know all about it.
They abandoned their country.
He likes French more than German.
I don't remember.
"Of all these cakes, I like this one best."
Were you busy?
I am okay.
I bought flowers because my grandmother is coming today for a visit.
May I interrupt?
We must try to protect the environment.
Tom lives close to you.
"Being lucky, he was in time for the train."
Tom didn't want me to help him.
He believes that he is a hero.
Tom wasn't born in Boston.
"At first, they didn't believe me, but now they do."
It doesn't happen often.
I understand your anger.
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?
This is a very rare specimen.
We must tell him about it.
What's wrong with this?
He looks older than my brother.
Tom didn't turn up after all.
Many drivers don't obey the speed limit.
Until what time are you open?
What sport do you like best?
I love French.
I thought Tom was mistaken.
Are you sure everyone's already left?
How many books can I take out at one time?
The weather forecast said it's going to rain.
I wish I'd studied harder when I was young.
I don't want to talk to you.
There are no potatoes left.
Tom is insanely rich.
The train gained speed gradually.
He has a nice personality.
The whole neighborhood was surprised at the news.
Sometimes it's enough simply to nod in response.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
The Japanese take off their shoes before entering a house.
Tom always carries a knife.
I don't blame you for doing that.
Tom gave me this before he died.
I'm looking for a room.
We went to church.
Tom isn't really good at swimming.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Tom is in bed with a cold.
The wind is cold today.
"He tried hard, but failed."
I don't know where he went.
I'll ask you one last time.
"Tom, do you have a mobile phone?"
Are you sure you don't want it?
I'll do it.
I'd like to listen to pop music.
"In general, men are taller than women."
"Hi, everybody."
I spent last Sunday reading a novel.
I hope you have a good trip.
Students must not use this toilet.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.
They canceled the festival.
I didn't think anybody else had noticed.
The postmortem showed that she had been strangled.
We have a lot of snow in the winter.
"Help me, please."
Are you ignoring me?
Recently I have had no appetite.
Are you and Tom friends?
The cost of living has gone down.
He can't see the forest for the trees.
He was absorbed in the book.
Since my husband became sick he's lost 20 kilograms and his pants are now baggy.
No students could answer the question.
I must get up as early as I can tomorrow morning.
"Come what may, I'm determined to accomplish it."
I've been here several times this year.
Don't do anything dangerous.
What do you suggest?
Take it easy.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I'm supporting my family.
We'll miss Tom.
My hobby is visiting old temples.
It will rain in the afternoon.
I'm too tired to walk.
I got divorced.
That word isn't in my dictionary.
Tom spent the day in his room.
Can you help me after school?
Who made the doll?
He was the only one who came to the party.
Tom brought flowers for Mary.
Tom and Mary were both there.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
Does the room have air conditioning?
I'm not good at cooking.
What're you all looking at?
Tom left without saying a thing.
Tom really wants to kiss Mary.
"Hey, wait a minute!"
I've made a mistake.
The sky grew darker and darker.
Thoughts are expressed by means of words.
My ears are ringing.
Everything tastes good.
I have a cold now.
I don't understand this question at all.
Is Tom a university student?
Do you want to go somewhere else?
I've always wanted to climb Mt. Fuji.
He went out in a hurry.
It is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not.
How many steps does this staircase have?
That isn't the reason that I came to Australia.
This bread is very delicious.
"Everyone laughed, including Tom."
There are many tall buildings.
Can you finish it by noon?
I go to the country every summer.
You do look nice today!
This auditorium can seat up to 300 people.
"Tom speaks beautiful French, without any accent."
The rent is due tomorrow.
We must cut down our expenses.
I've stopped drinking beer.
That's right.
"Call me every few days, and in that way we can keep in touch if something happens."
Tom lives in an apartment.
That's a very good idea.
It was heartless of him to say such a thing to the sick man.
Tom sends Mary a birthday present every year.
My backpack is very heavy.
Do you feel pain in any other part of your body?
I saw tears in her eyes.
I'm a bit drunk.
"Turn the radio on, please."
Wait.
You're so picky.
The dog frightened the children away.
It takes 10 minutes to walk to the station.
There are many books on the shelf that I haven't read yet.
I must use this bike.
It always takes time to get used to a new place.
There were a lot of people on the beach.
"Mom, hurry up! Everyone's waiting."
They're all college students.
We shouldn't have to be dealing with this problem now.
I hope your wish will come true.
"If possible, I'd like you to come tomorrow instead of today."
That book is on my desk.
Tom writes with a fountain pen.
Do you know this person?
He became a nice young man.
What happened this time?
He was absorbed in the book.
Don't shut your eyes.
Please sweep the floor.
Where are you going to eat lunch?
Did you want to ask me something?
Tom's French is perfect.
Our parents live right across the street from us.
Why don't you come over after school today?
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
This is the town where I was born.
Tom is outside playing with his friends.
I am very pleased to hear the news.
Talk as quietly as you can. The kids are asleep.
Was what Tom said true?
Shall we begin?
The boys are all the same age.
"If it isn't broken, don't fix it."
Tom and Mary went to an expensive restaurant.
Talking during a concert is rude.
I asked Tom to clean his room.
We don't have classes tomorrow afternoon.
I built a house within a stone's throw of the forest.
I hope he'll get better soon.
Have you ever been harassed?
It is needless to say that an experienced person will do better than someone without experience.
He suddenly stopped talking.
My favorite restaurant is Chuck's Diner.
Are you good at calligraphy?
Tom loved Mary and Mary loved him.
There aren't as many trains at night.
"Tom is leaving Boston tomorrow, right?"
I don't have enough food.
Tom put the book down.
"London, where I live, used to be famous for its fog."
"I saw that movie, but it wasn't very good."
Do you know kabuki?
Which is which?
I saw flashes of lightning in the distance.
We only need water.
My grandfather is a bit hard of hearing.
I bought a lot of fish at the supermarket today.
My father is too old to work.
There is a boy near the door.
"By the way, where do you live?"
Please explain the procedure.
You do ask a lot of questions.
"I want to go, too."
The telephone is now out of order.
Who taught you how to do this?
I can't take my eyes off her.
Does anyone want some more pie?
No need to worry.
How is the family?
He asked for my advice.
This is too big for one person to carry.
I've finally got the whole set!
"Give me the bill, please."
"You know who Tom is, don't you?"
"Tom won't be late, will he?"
Are you still awake?
Tom is very good at debugging.
I didn't know you went to law school.
"I have a new boyfriend, but my ex-boyfriend doesn't know about it yet."
Have you ever seen Tom angry?
I know that you live here.
A good idea occurred to him.
She is constantly writing letters.
I'm not free today.
What are you doing?
You must be a good cook.
I can't believe that she is older than my mother.
There's one piece left.
Please give me some airsickness medicine.
It is up to you.
The two men sitting on the bench were Americans.
The plan will be brought into effect tomorrow.
I think that that's wrong.
Are you open on Sunday?
Did you just feel an earthquake?
How many hours have you been studying?
I think that's a little unfair.
Will you stay here for a while?
How long did you live on the island?
I just got by on the test.
I want to be a pilot when I grow up.
He is busy all the time.
Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
"Tom and Mary were childhood friends, right?"
It is up to you.
We never use this room.
I know this area quite well.
We saw the sights of the city this afternoon.
Tom is usually the first to complain.
My doctor told me not to eat between meals.
Do you think that you can come?
It's already dinnertime.
I have nothing in particular to do tomorrow.
Where would you like to go tomorrow?
My mother is making tea for us.
Do you have a ticket?
Mary looked at herself in the mirror.
The road was slippery.
I agree with you.
Please speak a little slower.
Is this seat reserved?
Tom is clever.
Well done!
"As it happens, I don't have any money with me today."
Can you pass me the salt?
Tom doesn't actually live within Boston city limits.
How many prefectures are there in Japan?
Cooking is fun.
Tom isn't usually as busy as Mary.
"Ten to one, he will succeed."
I'm looking at my reflection in the lake.
Tom called Mary.
How did you know I was hungry?
I ate smoked salmon.
No one's living in the house next door.
"When he finished speaking, everyone was silent."
Do you know the meaning of this word?
It will be dark soon.
I lost my ticket. What should I do?
Tom likes his new car.
The clock is above the fireplace.
Tom had a previous engagement.
"The sooner, the better."
The teacher asked us to clean our classroom every day.
Would you like sugar and milk?
What'll become of Japan?
There isn't any milk left.
There isn't much difference between the two.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss your train."
"One day, Tom will understand."
I can't agree with you on this point.
This fish has a bad smell.
Tom opened a law office in Boston.
Please tell me how to delete my account.
He came to Tokyo with the dream of becoming rich.
There's no way Tom will change.
I sometimes cook dinner.
I broke a string on my guitar.
"On sunny days, the beach is crowded."
"It's really cold, don't you think?"
The school drains the pool once a month.
Stop teasing Tom.
Tom's clothes are out of fashion.
A crowd collected to watch the fight.
He's above telling lies.
Please don't look at your mobile phone while we're eating.
"When I grow up, I want to be a French teacher."
Lay the book on the table.
Do you have an alibi?
He arrived too early.
I don't think we can do it.
Can you put the children to bed?
"I'll be back by 7:00, I promise."
I only got a short glimpse of the thief.
It's a very steep slope.
I'm feeling a little nervous right now.
John met Mary on his way to school.
She asked me if I would be free next Sunday.
Sorry for being so inconsiderate.
I saw him recently.
See you!
I don't know if Tom is dead or alive.
Would you care for another cup of coffee?
This handle just won't turn.
This is the last one.
I'd appreciate it if you could give me some advice.
I stayed so he wouldn't feel lonely.
I'm convinced that my daughter will pass the exam.
You must be careful with the wine glass.
You always wear a ponytail. Why not try pigtails every now and then?
I was held up on my way to the hospital in a traffic jam.
I can't get this splinter out of my finger.
"All of a sudden, the barn went up in flames."
The apple is not yet ripe.
Take care!
Do you think my French is good?
I think it's true.
I could hear someone calling my name on the noisy platform.
It seems that no one knew the truth.
I'd like to eat something.
I'm sorry. I'm partly responsible for it.
That's a big sandwich.
Those people are my friends.
Tom is the only one who understands me.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
He judged it wiser to remain silent.
I've heard that there's a new cake shop near the station that makes delicious cakes.
What are you worried about?
Tom lives abroad.
"You're not busy now, are you?"
Could you write your name here?
He accumulated a large fortune.
Do you want me to stay with you?
I often played soccer when I was young.
He often gets sick.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for your health.
Tom said that he was going to do that tomorrow.
It's difficult to catch a wild rabbit by hand.
This tie goes well with that suit.
It's OK to sleep here if you want to.
I think it's somewhere around here.
How's your new job?
She persuaded him to do it.
The building has twenty floors.
Some people enjoy solitude.
This rule doesn't apply to first-year students.
I have a grammar book.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
It says on the label to take two tablets.
The fire was put out before it got serious.
It turned out well.
Blow your nose.
I just couldn't solve this problem.
That's out of the question.
We'll increase the rent next month.
I didn't eat the bread because there was mold on the crust.
Some people like red wine and some people like white wine.
I don't know him.
Tom doesn't have to go to school anymore.
Tom was quite concerned about what was happening.
This bucket has a hole in it.
I want to buy them all.
Tom cleaned his glasses.
The music was captivating.
"After you finish reading this letter, burn it."
Tom was unmarried.
He became irritated.
Tom will be here all morning.
What do you want for your birthday?
What's in the box?
You're overworked.
It's getting cooler day by day.
I lost ten kilos in three months.
A promise is a promise.
What do you suggest?
I heard that it's going to snow tomorrow.
I don't remember getting paid for the work.
Have you ever bought a lottery ticket?
Tom spent hours looking at the fish in the tank.
She is very angry with her children.
Why don't you do your homework?
Tom's brother is a doctor.
I want to become better at managing my time.
The house next door has been empty for many years.
This elevator is out of order. Please use the stairs.
You will miss the train.
These scissors cut well.
I don't see what's wrong with that.
I'm going to write a letter.
Tom should've known better than to kiss Mary in public.
How did you two first meet each other?
I always walk to school.
He swims better than I do.
Is there an ATM close by?
It just started to rain.

He didn't want to talk about it further.
I wish that you'd told me the truth then.
That kind of talk will get you nowhere.
She must be over eighty.
I'm going to open a pizza place.
Tom is a rich man.
I don't think it's strange at all.
All aboard!
Spring will come soon.
I think that Tom was born in Boston.
The riot police arrived on the scene.
I did all the work myself.
Why didn't you call anybody?
Murder is punished by death.
Would you like a single room?
She decided to marry him.
I didn't know that you could cook this well.
Turn right.
I get a physical examination once a year.
I took my camera along.
"Because of rain, we couldn't go to the beach."
I have a lot of friends living in Boston.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
We should cancel the hike.
I've already returned the key.
It's really cold today.
You must have been working too hard.
I think Tom is persuasive.
Could you help me translate that into French?
I often wish I'd been born a man.
Tom has written several songs about his hometown.
"I'm driving, so I can't answer the phone."
I blacked out.
Old people get sick easily.
Charge this to my account.
There's no running water.
Give me the soap.
How's the project progressing?
"After supper, I washed the dishes."
Where is the registrar's office?
She has brown eyes.
He postponed the party.
Can jellyfish stings kill you?
She became a postman.
"This is an example of the survival of the fittest, as it is called."
I reserved my hotel room three weeks in advance.
Tom didn't like Mary from the start.
I will be back soon.
Are you taller than Tom?
She couldn't look me straight in the face.
I considered changing my job.
Don't stare.
Did that guy say bad things about Tom again?
My son is a journalist.
I've got a great idea.
He'll become a good husband.
"Is it OK if I come tomorrow, too?"
Is there an ATM around here?
The accident happened two years ago.
Let's drink our coffee first.
Kissing a person who smokes is like licking an ashtray.
I was first in line.
I prefer red wine to white.
Are you suggesting that I stole something?
I said that I'm not going to do that again.
How do you earn your living?
I've just received a text from Tom.
I just want a little more sleep.
Tom took off his coat and hung it over a chair.
He goes to school by bus.
She agreed to my idea.
She is particular about food.
Do you remember the first time we kissed?
I got this CD player for free.
I already know.
Everybody waited.
We saw a lake far below.
There's no chance of winning.
I work hard at a hotel every day.
You should relax a little.
I'm on my way to visit a friend in the hospital.
Show it to me again.
I don't have to go there alone.
"When I see someone eating hayashi rice, I want to eat it, too."
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
Tom said that he was sorry.
I wanted you to see it.
Can't you get by on your salary?
I like working.
Have I kept you waiting long?
"That's cheap, isn't it?"
I was just going to write a letter.
Where can I put my bag?
Tom called for Mary's resignation.
"She ignored him, which proved unwise."
She accused me of being a liar.
Is this medicine effective?
I like fish better than meat.
How do you feel?
It's time for dinner.
I wonder why he was suddenly dropped from the team half way through.
Let me get you something to drink.
His parents told him to get into a university.
Is this good French?
I closed my eyes to calm down.
I persuaded Tom to go to Boston.
"Tom, will you let me copy your math homework?"
It's because light travels faster than sound that we see lightning before we hear thunder.
I need money.
The car Tom bought was a lemon.
"Yesterday I had some free time for the first time in a long time, so I went swimming."
I want to get a divorce.
"I like his new house, but I had not expected it to be so small."
Spring has come.
"Since I haven't received an answer, I was wondering if maybe my mail never got delivered to you."
The Shinano is longer than any other river in Japan.
How did you know Tom would kiss Mary?
I have to go to bed.
These dogs are big.
My friend was arrested for speeding.
I wonder what the cause was.
Someone stole my bicycle.
It looks like the dog wants something to eat.
Stop laughing.
We have to put off the game till next Sunday.
I don't want to watch television.
Please remember to wake me up at seven tomorrow morning.
They are out of hand.
Tom and Mary didn't invite me to their wedding.
Tom rode his bicycle to school.
Why are you so good at cooking?
I never see this picture without being reminded of my childhood.
This store opens at eight.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
The commanding officer led his army into enemy territory.
I don't want to do that alone.
That's quite old.
Can you tell if it'll rain tomorrow?
Watch out for that man.
I'm thinking of buying a new car.
It seems to me that he is honest.
I'm afraid that I'll make a mistake.
No one will find out.
"Sooner or later, the hostages will be set free."
"If you buy me an ice cream, I'll give you a kiss."
Here's to your health.
Tomorrow we go to school to sign up for the classes we want to take.
I haven't seen him for a long time.
May I bring my friends?
She waved her hand to me.
The train will arrive soon.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
I'm sure about his name.
We call him Tom.
It's like summer outside.
He has two dogs.
Are you still in school?
Everything is OK.
My grandfather used to make his own furniture.
What's the name of this tune?
Have you seen a little girl with short black hair?
Can I leave a message?
I don't think it's a problem anymore.
She cried until she ran out of tears.
Take this table away.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I promised my parents I'd study French.
You ought to finish your homework at once.
We've never actually been out on a date together.
Give me some credit.
I have an appointment with him at six.
That isn't what I meant.
Tom often drinks green tea.
That is another matter.
Tom doesn't know a whole lot about racing.
This is not the entrance.
The cookies are under the table.
What's that big building ahead of us?
Both my sister and brother go to college.
Divide the pizza among you three.
I would also like to rent a car.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
Come quickly.
I vaguely remember meeting him.
A burning meteoroid produces a meteor.
You work too much.
You can't park on this street.
How many pencils do you have?
I couldn't do anything.
How many years have you been with this company?
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I figured Tom could do that.
Can I have some caramel ice cream?
It's too late to shut the barn door after the horse is stolen.
I'll be in Boston next Monday.
Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed?
Relax.
Is Tom still doing his homework?
Where can I find a shuttle bus?
There are a few books in the bag.
Is it impossible to live to be 150?
This is how the accident happened.
It is time you told her the truth.
It isn't a big deal. Don't worry about it.
I think Mary looks cute with bangs.
Does anybody have a pencil?
Thank you for your assistance.
I am accustomed to staying up late.
Let's cook dinner together.
I think what you need now is some sleep.
"See to this matter right away, will you?"
Go ahead!
We ran out of gas on the way there.
The steam has fogged my glasses.
How many children are there?
We arrived first.
Your secret will be safe with me.
No sooner had she found him than she burst into tears.
He gave his life for his country.
I hope that I can be of some help to you.
My mother has old-fashioned ideas.
"I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself."
It was cheaper than I thought.
I'm no fool.
Show me what you have in your hand.
I'm glad to hear that.
Here is a photograph of my family.
I'd like to tell you something in private.
I don't think it's weird at all.
Anyone who wants to come is welcome.
My laptop's stopped working.
The door will lock automatically when you go out.
Be at the station at eleven on the dot.
Everything is OK.
The movie that I watched last night was really scary.
I'm not sure about that. It depends.
Who broke the news of her death to you?
A calculator may be used during the test.
Spitting on streets is a crime in Singapore.
That's an excellent idea.
I work in a travel agency.
"According to the paper, it will snow tomorrow."
He wasn't the same as I thought he'd be.
"Seen from the plane, the island looks very beautiful."
Neither Tom nor Mary has ever lived in Boston.
My house faces the sea.
What time do you usually get up?
There is a crack in the glass.
Tom and Mary were both screaming.
The student left without saying anything.
"Because of the heavy snow, the train was 10 minutes late."
Tom has no money.
We had a bar of gold stolen.
They put off their departure due to the heavy snow.
I'll be home all weekend.
Can I call you later?
You really shouldn't use pirated software.
You have to be patient.
You may choose whichever you want.
I have enough money.
"I called home, but no one was there."
Why are we talking about Tom?
"Since there were no customers, we closed the shop early."
She's at home taking care of the kids.
There's no membership fee for joining.
Please sit down.
"It was you who told the teacher I cheated, wasn't it?"
"Believe it or not, I can actually draw."
"I love music, especially rock."
Don't leave here until you've done that.
You're always the cause of my worries.
How many times a year do you go skiing?
He has no eye for women.
A sudden illness prevented him from going there.
It's not at all rare to live to be over ninety years old.
When are you coming to Boston again?
Do you need this?
How will you dispose of this problem?
I was able to finish the work earlier than I had expected.
I had to work hard when I was young.
Who was the man killed on the hill?
We have a 20% share of the market.
A woman whose husband is dead is called a widow.
What's up with you?
Tom was lonely.
I believe that the story is true.
He has a big mouth.
He came into my room.
I can't afford to keep a car.
I like to write poems.
There were no chairs in the room.
Did you solve that problem?
Wait here.
I tried the shoes on.
Are you having any difficulty breathing through your nose?
I'm not sure if this is correct.
He goes to school by bicycle.
The point is they're too young.
My father often goes fishing in the river nearby.
Tokyo has a larger population than any other city in Japan.
Tom said that he thought that Mary was married.
I think that I understand.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I wouldn't let Tom do that.
Let me stay here a little longer.
Do you know this tune?
"You don't live around here, do you?"
"If Tom had been wearing a helmet, he wouldn't have been injured so badly."
This cheese is really good.
When's Tom arriving?
Tom made some scrambled eggs.
Leave it.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
There was a glut of cotton goods due to cheap imports.
I'll call you later.
My father doesn't do anything at home.
We are his sons.
It happened that we were in London then.
"Daddy, let's have a staring contest."
Why do we need to learn this stuff anyway?
I'm eating an apple.
Tom needs to practice.
Please look at the pamphlet for the details.
I like both this one and that one.
Use a calculator.
Take an umbrella with you in case it rains.
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
"In Switzerland, spring comes in May."
I went there yesterday.
Tom looked at the price tag once again.
He repaired his watch by himself.
I really hate dairy products.
I'm worried about you.
Tom is probably sleeping.
I always drink a glass of milk before going to sleep.
"It is a nice day, isn't it?"
We dissected a frog to examine its internal organs.
He came down with the flu.
I'll sleep here.
It's not even on the map.
That name seemed familiar.
Actions speak louder than words.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Do what you think is best.
Tom knew he had to buy a present for Mary.
She is quite satisfied with her new job.
Tokyo has a larger population than London.
Where did you learn that?
When will it start?
I accompanied her on the piano.
I'm always ready.
I wonder if Tom knows how to do this.
Tom went to the lake with Mary.
She keeps her hair in curls.
I wonder who started that rumor.
We live very near the school.
I'll bring flowers the next time I visit.
The door was slightly open.
What's your main reason for studying French?
Do you want to give it another try?
Give my shoes a good shine.
Do you know why she's so angry?
He wasn't long in making up his mind.
I have to return this book to the library.
Do as I told you to do.
I didn't know what to do first.
"I enjoy swimming, but I don't want to swim here."
I'm not used to speaking in public.
We have to decide before it's too late.
That couple are newly weds.
He went to America to study English.
I like rock.
This is clearly wrong.
Have you ever visited anyone in prison?
International disputes must be settled peacefully.
I'll arrive a bit later.
She has blue eyes.
How many times have you gone?
He's raking it in.
My knapsack is very heavy.
"If you have a cold, lack of sleep is very bad for you."
I work three days a week.
What time do you have supper?
I'm looking for my wallet. Have you seen it?
I managed to get there in time.
I like the one with a white belt.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
"Not knowing what to say, I remained silent."
Are you an only child?
Please fix it.
I need to buy more pens.
Tom never wanted to get a divorce.
Kids catch colds easily.
I had my room cleaned.
The total is one hundred.
The photograph is blurry.
I lost my mobile phone.
"We've had a heavy rain, so the playground is muddy."
This search engine is no good.
It rained again today.
This is the house where Tom was born.
I need to read more books.
"I'll do that for you, Tom."
What're your recommendations?
My heart beats fast each time I see her.
Tom got dressed and put on his shoes.
I'm OK.
He lost his eyesight.
This is very interesting.
I want to stay a few days.
We're learning French.
I was there until 2:30.
Tom and I are good friends.
I met her on the street.
Why do golf balls have dimples?
The bottle of wine that I bought this afternoon is in the fridge.
Don't cut down this tree.
He trusts his assistant quite a lot.
Do you know what you're doing?
He is a teacher and a novelist.
Tom checked the equipment.
She doesn't like the way I speak.
I need to stop smoking.
Tom died a few days ago.
He pulled his son by the ear.
Quit tickling me.
You may call me by my first name.
That candle isn't white.
I didn't understand that last sentence.
Was this made in France?
It isn't far from the hotel.
It's been my dream since I was a little girl.
These books are heavy.
My dream is to go to Australia.
The boy was permitted to go with them.
Did you buy a new car?
The obstacles to our progress have been removed at last.
I'm afraid of my wife.
I woke up with an upset stomach.
I became a member of the club ten years ago.
He's about the same age as you are.
Is there much water behind the dam?
I love cats and dogs.
I'll come back tomorrow.
What is in the box?
It's been three years since Tom started working for Mary.
I'm free on Sunday.
Look up the new words in your dictionary.
Tom does everything he can to save money.
I had to choose between the two.
You always take the lion's share!
Four is an unlucky number in Japan.
Have you ever kissed another girl?
I was in Boston last May.
Is there someone waiting for you at home?
They'll be here soon.
I have been abroad several times this year.
My mother put the cake in the refrigerator.
This isn't over yet.
I'd really like to drink a cup of coffee.
She left France for the United States.
The button came off.
I'll give you a local anesthetic.
I visited the village Tom was born in.
Is there anything you want to do?
Today is a beautiful sunny day and I feel good.
She is very pretty.
Why are you carrying a gun?
I studied French at school.
I've decided to go back to Australia with Tom.
Let's walk to the lake.
What's the weather like today?
He is every bit a gentleman.
He signed the check.
I started a new blog. I'll do my best not to be one of those people who blogs a lot right at the start and then quits blogging.
I'm in seventh heaven.
I was always proud of my mother.
"Well, it's worth a try."
Do as you like.
I'll carry this bag for you.
You should get home.
"Thanks for your help, Tom."
A bat is no more a bird than a rat is.
Is Tom good at playing the saxophone?
May I go swimming?
I was abducted by aliens.
Tom daydreamed in class.
Tom is more intelligent than Mary thinks he is.
Are you free tonight?
The loss amounts to a million dollars.
I'm a doctor.
Do you have any objection to this plan?
Tom carefully checked that the gas was turned off.
Light travels much faster than sound.
They didn't play tennis yesterday.
May I smoke here?
What's your name?
Give me three pieces of salmon.
Change your clothes.
"Actually, I'll stay in the city for a few more days."
Are gas prices going to go down?
"Your business is flourishing, I hear."
Tom looked up at the starry sky.
Tom won't change his opinion.
We're in luck.
Are both of you still single?
We're running out of patience.
I'll tell Tom everything.
"The dog followed its master, wagging its tail."
I don't know why I did that.
She volunteered to help him.
Calm down.
"Long time, no see."
Which browser are you using?
All is well.
Tom and Mary left through different doors.
Prices depend on the costs and the demand.
We have limited resources.
"If you aren't quiet, the baby will wake up."
Let me know if you are in need of anything.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Could you tell me how to call this number?
The problem was I didn't know Tom was dating Mary.
He's popular with the students.
I need a plate.
It is surprising that he should not know this.
I'm from Boston.
He played golf day after day during his vacation.
The game became exciting.
"If that works, I'll eat my hat."
Go exercise outside.
Tom seems to be in love with Mary.
I want some candy.
She wore a pretty hat.
I have been acquainted with her for more than 20 years.
I walked three-fourths of a mile.
How long will this rain go on?
Tom left after breakfast.
I've already bought my ticket.
He came to my rescue.
It is said that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day.
"She has 2,000 books."
The price depends on the size.
The issues listed have already been fixed.
Who else can't come?
Do you speak French well?
I don't think we'll make it on time.
He gave up cigarettes.
"Your plan is a good one, but mine is better."
I wish I had a car.
Tom accidentally locked himself out of his office.
He always works hard.
I have a wooden comb.
Swiss chocolate really melts in your mouth.
It sounds like a scam.
What are you doing?
Can I ask something?
Please don't quit.
When will it start?
He fought against racial discrimination.
I can't get rid of this cold.
We finally got to the lake.
There's a possibility that it'll snow tonight.
He left without saying goodbye.
Could you move the chair a bit?
I changed my address last month.
Does that taste good?
He walked along the river.
Who are you going to eat dinner with?
The printer's out of ink.
May I take a rain check?
There is a knife missing.
This fish has a lot of bones.
This town isn't as busy as it used to be.
I owe ten dollars to her.
Show me tangible data.
I'll have to catch the 8:15 train to Paris.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
I'll write you as soon as I arrive there.
I'd like to rent a compact car.
How many rooms are there in your house?
I know the name of this animal.
He was blind from birth.
"It's cold this morning, isn't it?"
"The train will come soon, right?"
The men are wearing short sleeve shirts.
I am interested in sports.
This flower smells nice.
Mount Everest is located in the Himalayas.
The money you sent isn't enough.
Could you tell me how to get there?
I'm broke.
They said they'd make the boarding announcement 20 minutes before takeoff.
We're looking for jobs.
Tom likes garlic bread.
I've got a cold.
She was really cold.
All the tickets are sold out.
When did you come to Japan?
Tom and Mary exchange more than 200 text messages every day.
Tom showed me what was in his wallet.
Have you seen my watch?
She will care for you from now on.
Who's eaten all the cookies?
Tom was made to wait for over an hour.
Has he gone already?
French is my mother tongue.
Tom is claustrophobic.
You should free those animals from the cage.
I can't excuse her.
Push the button here.
I'd like some more butter.
It's important to read a lot of books.
Put on your good shoes.
I get emotional sometimes.
Tom has his eyes closed and is pretending to be asleep.
"They aren't children any more, but not adults yet."
That man has very long legs.
How about some more roast beef?
Have you had lunch?
Keep in touch!
I have few books.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't know the answer.
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
He's always joking.
"Excuse me, are you a student here?"
I was so happy to see Tom again.
Tom went for a drive.
You need to be careful.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
"Put this on my tab, please."
Cheer up.
Tom can speak German as well as English.
"To begin with, you must be honest."
Tom might be frightened.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom would be interested in buying your old MP3 player.
My house isn't near the station.
Our main office is in Boston.
The match is starting just now.
I really love French.
I don't think Tom and Mary are engaged.
How did he react to the bad news?
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Dinosaurs are now extinct.
I can't stand this any longer.
Tom told me I walked like a penguin.
Stay away from me.
Tell us exactly what you did.
I'm somewhat dizzy.
This is homemade jam.
Tom has been expecting Mary.
He was absent from the meeting.
I had to get up very early this morning.
Paris is the capital of France.
"The phone rang, but no one answered."
I never want to see you again.
I don't like bad boys.
Tom has blue eyes.
She spends a lot of money on books.
You should write Tom a letter.
I'm scared of cats.
Is this the first time you've tried Japanese food?
I have some work to do this evening.
Were you drunk when you hit Tom?
Please lock the gate.
Did you ask the price?
This call is free of charge.
Let's quit and go home.
How much are the strawberries?
You ought to have come to see me yesterday.
Be sure to come here by the appointed time.
Don't use the black pen.
Do it quickly.
You can make up for lost time by taking an airplane instead of a train.
You are going too far.
A cat is sleeping over there.
Pick it up.
Use your common sense.
The human brain weighs about three pounds.
Have you already had breakfast?
I'll tell you when you're older.
How do you know Tom has a dog?
Tom tickled Mary.
I got this from Tom.
You have beautiful legs.
I'll let you stay one night.
My nose itches.
"When I was asked by an old man where the church was, I pointed it out."
Can we talk?
Tom doesn't listen.
Tom made a speech.
She bought a yard of cloth.
I'm sleepy.
Please wait five more minutes.
What do you do?
I think we should use our time a bit more constructively.
"It's your money, isn't it?"
I saw him go out.
I nearly had a heart attack.
She is good-natured.
Time passes quickly.
"I've been to Australia, but only once."
He can bend an iron rod with his hands.
"Beginning next week, we'll be using a new textbook."
The other day I went fishing for the first time in my life.
Take care not to catch a cold.
I forgot to shave.
Christmas only comes once a year.
I was at a loss for an answer.
You seem to have gained some weight.
"What is this? ""It's a peach."""
Do you think it's my fault?
When did you first come to Australia?
I had my money stolen in the park.
Fruit is rich in vitamins.
Modern art doesn't interest me.
Water evaporates when it is heated.
We worked all night.
I'm free tomorrow so I'm going to hang out with my friends.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
The economy still hasn't completely recovered from the financial crisis.
Several thousand people became victims of this disease.
You are being ridiculous today.
I can't do that.
You need to wear a tie there.
Tom and Mary said that they aren't busy.
I left Boston last year and haven't yet been back.
His wife is in the hospital because she was injured in a car crash.
I'm a little bit concerned.
He looked young.
You have no choice in this matter.
Write to me as soon as you get there.
What about a glass of beer?
Monday is my busiest day.
Nobody likes a wise guy.
I'll make you a sandwich if you want one.
He has a long nose.
I get up at six every day.
How do you eat this?
I still love this bicycle.
Tom couldn't come.
I think she's a witch.
Pardon me for interrupting.
Is she at home?
How do you say it in French?
Do you have a bicycle?
Is there a swimming pool?
The exception proves the rule.
A lot of people are starving in the world.
I've decided to eat out tonight.
Would you do something for me?
Love is blind.
Enemies of enemies aren't always allies.
Tom didn't invite me to his birthday party.
You ought not to say such a thing.
The weather has been nice all week.
I don't have any time to watch TV.
I always get up late.
Tom refuses to speak French.
He has a good chance of being chosen.
I can't wait any longer.
Do you have the latest version?
Hundreds of people work in this factory.
Tom called Mary up.
I've got nothing to do today.
He's afraid of the sea.
Tom and Mary like each other.
This ticket allows two people to enter.
"I'd like to stay here and chat, but I have to go to a concert my kid's playing in."
There aren't many good tunes coming out nowadays.
Do you have any siblings?
The number of murders is increasing even in a country like Japan.
Tom is a tennis coach.
There are a lot of fish in the pond.
Tom agrees.
Could you please delete this picture?
How long does it take from here to the station?
I said that as a joke.
Do you think that my work is easy?
Are you sure that's what Tom said?
Tom works as an interpreter.
"If something happens, feel free to call me."
Which wine goes best with red meat?
It is no exaggeration to call him a genius.
Can I buy things here duty-free?
I think three years is a long time.
Tom didn't know that he had a secret admirer.
"Please give me some water. ""All right."""

Everything is fine.
I never counted on his being rich.
Where are you living now?
Health is the most precious thing we have.

"You can do this, can't you?"
I have lost my umbrella.

We didn't have classes today.
What's your impression of the United States?
The dog ran after the cat.
How about going to the movies?
My watch is broken.

I hope to become a singer.
"Tom, did you eat anything?"
I have few friends.
I want to go abroad.
Are you going to go anywhere this summer?
Please turn right.
Why did you come early?
Tom probably died.
It hasn't been thirty minutes yet.
Tom took a blanket off the bed and wrapped it around himself.
How much did that dress cost?
Have you ever heard Tom speak French?
Don't get smart with me.
It isn't new.
He came several times.
This is the hottest summer we've had in thirty years.
How do you like living in Boston?
There's something I want you to see.
I thought the same thing.
Do you think there are aliens?
Wait just a moment.
She laid a blanket over him.
I told Mary that I just wanted to be friends.

You must take his age into account.
My parents were there waiting for me.
I disagree with the decision.
How many books does he have?
"I didn't win, but at least I got a consolation prize."
He gets hives when he eats eggs.
It makes no difference to me.
This game is really fun.
You can say that again.
Would it be OK if I kissed you?
I just want to know where you're from.
He's as poor as can be.
I'm pretty sure that tower is 330 meters tall.
We need to take care of this immediately.
Do you have a fever?
You should be careful with a knife.
You're not sick.
I don't suppose it's going to rain.
I love her.
I had not waited long before he appeared.

Back up a little.
Is it OK if I park here?
You're still young.
Where were you skiing?

She promised to meet him last night.
I saw it with my own eyes.
There are many people in the park.
Mary kept on working in spite of her illness.

Please show me this book.
I'm rolling in cash.
You don't have to bring your lunch.
My father is in his room.
We purchased a new house for eighty thousand dollars.
Who did you buy this for?
I was an idiot to believe Tom.
"A cup of coffee, please."
She is more pretty than beautiful.
Wait one second.
What made you think that?
I will be back soon.

I made a little mistake.
Tom switched the TV on.
Let's play.
There are so many things to tell you that I don't know where to start.
I never expected to meet Tom here.
It'll be easy to find someone to rent this house.
"If possible, I'd like to know the name of the author."
The plates are dirty.
I bought a new suit of clothes.
Will you teach me how to play the guitar?
I apologize for my bad handwriting.
Would you like me to get you a cab?
A book is on the table.
The bus fares have been raised by 20 percent.
What prevented you from coming yesterday?
You must be worn out after working all day.
She's smartly dressed.
Do you remember that girl I talked to you about?
My ears are frostbitten.
"If you don't want to get married, it would be better if you didn't get married."
Let me see it.
I wonder where I put my glasses.
She can't write or read.
I don't need a receipt.
Tom was angry at Mary because she parked in his space.
"It wasn't that bad, was it?"
It's been five years since my father passed away.
You shouldn't abandon your friends.
Tom left the office immediately after work.
This river looks like it's going to overflow.
I need to lose five pounds.
I have some news.
Tell me again where you live.
It's not easy to speak a foreign language.
I want to eat some cake.
What do you think of this plan?
I'm going to check out at eight.
I bought a camera.
Tom answered a few questions.
She insists on her son being innocent.
Words failed me.
Tom leaned against the fence.
I don't think he is truthful.
I'm doing that already.
The student insulted the teacher.
I don't drink.
Is everybody ready?
I can't put up with this any longer.
I borrowed some money from a friend.
You'll get a reward for your cooperation.
Do you have money for a cab?
Tom is battling cancer.
The boy caressed the girl's chin and kissed her cheek.
He plays the guitar well.
Tom is a chemistry teacher.
Let's get back together.
We're not going anywhere today.
"Although the sun was out, it was cold."
It's frozen hard.
Do any of the members agree with you?
The rumor turned out to be false.
Tom isn't usually as busy as Mary is.
"This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it."
I can hardly wait till I see you.
Tom didn't buy it.
We're better.
Please paint the door white.
I prefer to do it alone.
Tom took a taxi to the hospital.
China is the biggest country in Asia.
You never know what you can do till you try.
How long ago did the bus leave?
I think it's unlikely that Tom will get back in time for supper.
This water is safe to drink.
I remember the event as clearly as if it had happened just yesterday.
Do you believe in vampires?
New York is a big city.
Tom must've thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
The game was postponed because of snow.
Is the cafeteria open yet?
Let's dig up the potatoes.
The single rooms were fully booked.
What a gorgeous flower!
It was for Tom and Mary.
How many siblings do you have?
I was welcomed.
My brother has been much too rowdy lately.
No one has died.
I love traveling alone.
We sat next to Tom.
Tom told me that he'd give me that book if I wanted it.
There is no necessity for you to do that.
Tom has to meet a lot of people tomorrow morning.
He can come.
The most important thing in life is to be yourself.
I won't work overtime today.
"My sister hasn't come home yet, so my mother is worried."
Where's my room?
That's probably your toothbrush.
We have to live together.
We can't be sure which door Tom will come through.
The train went through a tunnel.
He had a strange dream.
We're getting off at the last station.
The price does not include the box.
I'll be staying at the Hilton Hotel.
I think I've figured out which horse is most likely to win the race.
Please excuse me for being rude.
I'd be willing to help.
This gift is for you.
He set out for Tokyo this morning.
Remember to take your medicine.
It sounds like a nice place to live.
How many blueberry muffins did you eat yesterday?
She went to Italy to study music.
"For the time being, I will wait for the result of the survey."
I went back to my village during the summer vacation.
You have to trust your instincts.
The train just left.
"Roll up your sleeve, please."
My older sister finally got married.
You'll get well in a week or so.
I think it would be better to tell Tom the truth.
I missed the bus.
Our children are grown.
I lived in that house when I was a child.
It didn't stop snowing.
It's no use trying anything.
Did you study by yourself?
Come to my place.
Someone is at the front door. Go and see who it is.
"Hey, I said I was sorry."
Ask Tom if he understands French.
It is not safe for a girl to go out by herself so late at night.
The responsibility is mine.
"A tea with lemon, please."
This is a book about stars.
Please say it once more.
Would you like to drink anything?
Let him in.
I don't usually sleep well the night before a test.
Tom likes ice cream.
Could you tell me all the details?
What's the matter? You look very angry.
When are you planning to tie the knot?
"I liked Mary, not for her looks, but for her kindness."
I'd prefer not to go jogging with Tom.
Tom is under surveillance.
Nobody could explain how the thing was made.
The doctor advised my father to give up smoking.
The speaker requested that the audience remain silent.
The price isn't reasonable.
Did you buy this book?
"In spite of the fact that Tom is thirty, he's still dependent on his parents."
Tom was relieved.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Why do you want to buy this book?
How much are these shoes?
Let's flag a taxi and go home.
"The fire, driven by an east wind, destroyed the center of the city."
How much time do adults spend watching television every day?
This suitcase is really heavy.
He's started writing a novel.
The boy threw a stone at the frog.
The rich are not always happy.
Tom seems to be very happy.
"That was cheap, but I couldn't eat it."
It's a kind of orange.
He is a highly paid man.
I'm not sure why that is.
Is that okay?
Tom's parents didn't like Mary.
"If a person has not had a chance to acquire his target language by the time he's an adult, he's unlikely to be able to reach native speaker level in that language."
"Feeling the house shake, I ran out into the backyard."
I want a guitar.
That's perfectly natural.
I don't think that Tom is intelligent.
Tom is very wealthy.
That eagle is beautiful.
Tom now lives with his mom.
Thou shalt not kill.
Was Tom the one who wrote this?
I will finish my homework by nine.
I'm a citizen of the world.
What happened?
Are you waiting for someone?
I can't find Tom. Has he gone already?
You are very kind to show me the way.
I finally got hold of that book I wanted.
I'm leaving for Chicago next week.
Not a sound was heard.
He is always cheerful.
We need a firm quotation by Monday.
This coat is ten thousand yen.
Nobody here tried to do that.
Tom said that he'd help us tomorrow.
I was plenty nervous.
It was only a dream.
Her car is two years old.
Gravity is the natural force by which objects are attracted to each other.
Are you pregnant?
Were you praised by the teacher?
Please keep this to yourself.
My sister often cries.
Tom bought us matching swimsuits.
Learning to speak a foreign language well takes a lot of time.
Let's grab some coffee.
We'll talk afterwards.
Please refrain from smoking here.
Please replace the empty ink cartridge in the printer.
They hated Tom.
We were caught in a traffic jam on the way.
I wish I had been with her then.
Why didn't you go to school?
"The radius of the earth is about 6,000 km."
Please reply as soon as you get this email.
There are a lot things that need to be done this afternoon.
It's quite clear to me that is the truth.
Is anybody else in the house?
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
Playing cards is very interesting.
Is it still for sale?
Don't get drunk.
The painter died young.
Who built it?
It's doubtful that Tom will come.
I'd rather use olive oil than butter.
Who told you how to do that?
Don't you ever do that anymore?
I admire you.
"Work hard, or you'll fail."
Tom introduced me to Mary.
Father is proud of his car.
Wait a moment.
She couldn't help from crying.
Is it OK if I borrow this dictionary?
What is your favorite animal?
At Christmas she went out of her way to buy me a really nice model plane.
I guess you're right.
The meeting will start at four o'clock sharp.
This car needs washed.
Those are the leftovers from lunch.
Tom looks rich.
There are no chairs in this room.
He seldom orders anything new.
My father is very angry with me.
Tom's mother's name isn't Mary.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Do you want to go by train or by bus?
Japan is in the eastern part of Asia.
You can't go against the laws of nature.
My father bought this house for us when we got married.
Please hold on a moment.
We had to wait over three hours.
I can't eat strawberries.
I tried it and found it very useful.
This time of year is my favorite.
I'm Tom.
The medicine had an immediate effect.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.
I wish my neighbors would get rid of their wind chimes.
Are these yours?
Hideyo Noguchi was a great man.
Is that a parrot?
I must use this bike.
It's just like walking on the moon.
That party wasn't at all fun.
My doctor told me not to snack between meals.
I really appreciate your kindness.
You can't live without water.
How long will we have to wait?
Maybe it would be better not to add pepper.
Have you ever been to Australia?
Thanks for your help.
What were you doing at the time?
It was that dog that bit my hand.
What are you talking about?
I had been in Tokyo only three days when I received news of my father's death.
The train was derailed.
Tom is making me dinner.
Tom told me that I could keep the book if I wanted it.
I want to punch you in the face.
Tom and I have an arrangement.
"As a matter of fact, I've gotten back with my old boyfriend."
He could do it.
Don't cut these trees down.
Tom's kidneys and liver are in bad shape.
Don't go out after dark.
How many students are on the list?
There were two cakes.
He's not stupid.
I don't know.
I'd like to learn how to arrange flowers.
I gave a flower to my father.
I have just been to the station to see my uncle off.
Who's playing the violin?
Eating too much is bad for your health.
When are you going to get back from Boston?
I'll be seeing him tomorrow.
I found the boy sound asleep.
How well does Tom know Mary?
Apologize to them.
Tom got a small portion of pie.
"With a little more patience, you would've succeeded."
My shoes are the same size as his.
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
I've been anticipating his arrival.
"Tom is from Boston, right?"
I was impressed by his music.
Your eyes are red. What happened?
We found out that the house is infested with garter snakes. They're everywhere.
I did everything I could.
Tom and Mary have been friends for three years.
Tom doesn't like chicken.
Why are you crying?
Tom is really a nice person.
"When the rain stops, we'll go for a walk."
Tom was unaware of the danger.
He is hard to deal with.
This paper doesn't absorb ink.
"Generally speaking, boys can run faster than girls."
Are Tom and Mary working together?
I have a cold.
Are you 18?
I love strawberries.
My pack is very heavy.
The blood test is normal.
Don't make any noise.
Can you make it cheaper?
This tie goes with your shirt.
Tom blamed the teacher for his failure.
Shall I help you look for your keys?
Tom and Mary say they just want to talk to you.
It rains a lot in June.
Do you have any interest in sports?
This chair is really comfortable to sit on.
I already sold that.
Do you know what time the class will start?
Tom arrived at noon.
That's a completely unfounded rumor.
Are you sure you don't want to go to Boston?
I'll go tomorrow.
How's the new job?
You're no longer children.
Please keep it a secret.
Who was it who left the door open?
Are you planning on eating that all by yourself?
Wash your hands.
Do you know what the population of Tokyo is?
They're both from Boston.
Nobody tried to help Tom.
He learned the poem by heart.
May I borrow your car?
I get emotional sometimes.
"It is windy today, isn't it?"
I'm looking forward to the summer vacation.
Dr. Tom Jackson is a famous doctor.
Do jellyfish stings kill you?
Tom didn't tell me the reason why he was late.
Thank you for everything.
It's time to go to bed.
The Japanese population is shrinking.
I'd study if I were you.
The two ladies smiled at each other.
"We'll go to Hong Kong first, and then we'll go to Singapore."
Halloween is almost here.
Those are my CDs.
I don't like his way of talking.
Do you want to eat?
I never said that I wanted that.
We were just talking about you when you called.
Please eat.
"It isn't that weird, is it?"
There's no hurry.
Are you sure Tom isn't here?
"If you want to change your opinion, then go right ahead."
I don't know how old Tom is.
She's sometimes late for school.
A cup of coffee cost 200 yen in those days.
Please give me another pillow.
Tom will regret it.
I'm traveling by myself.
He studied the way birds fly.
I don't like Easter eggs.
"Some people write books for money, others for pleasure."
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss your train."
Who's that guy?
He made up his mind to marry her.
I wanted to buy some chocolate.
What's your destination?
I'm not in the mood for pizza.
See you next week.
You shouldn't give up hope.
He didn't attend the meeting.
Come over here.
Is this the first time that you've ever given blood?
This is my favorite dress.
I pretended to be working.
I ate too much and got sleepy.
I bought a sweater to give to Tom.
Please hold on a moment.
I still haven't washed the car.
He is seriously ill and unlikely to recover.
I've been busy today.
I usually wake up at six.
Glass breaks easily.
Tom honked at Mary.
Shut your eyes.
She advised him to give up drinking.
I could eat a horse.
That's a piece of cake.
The police continued their investigation.
Today is a special day.
I like history.
You're prohibited from smoking here.
I hope it does not rain tomorrow.
"This belongs to you, I think."
He earns a great deal.
I won't be able to pick Tom up at the airport.
Why do you have your umbrella up? It's not raining.
We're men.
The vase Tom broke is Mary's.
That's my teacher.
I've decided to stay.
Tom looks exhausted.
I'm not very good at drawing.
Is that all?
I wanted to buy a book to read on the plane.
I am willing to agree to your request.
Their losses reached one million yen.
"I'm sorry, but I have to go to the gym."
It isn't expensive.
That's a good plan.
Are you and Tom still dating?
I'll give you a call before I visit you.
It seemed impossible that Tom would succeed.
She was as thin as a rail.
I like it very much.
I'm going to shut up now.
You looked angry.
Tom couldn't swim.
You should take it easy.
Tom was stabbed to death.
I love math.
We conducted our investigation with the greatest care.
She's in the hospital now.
Mary gave me a kiss on the cheek.
Do you want to help me?
"It will cost around 10,000 yen."
Tom has a weak heart.
It turned out that he was her father.
The ground was covered with frost this morning.
Are there any issues I should be aware of?
My younger sister has already gone to sleep.
How far is it from here to the station?
I hope nothing happens to Tom.
Why don't you believe it?
The sky cleared up.
Thank you for the detailed explanation.
Can you tell us more about it?
Straighten your tie.
Ten miles is not a short distance.
May I speak to you a minute?
Tom has no sense of fashion.
I thought it would be fun for us to go skiing together.
Please translate this into French.
There's nothing to eat.
Nothing has to be done.
Tom couldn't decide which camera to buy.
Do you know what color she likes?
I don't agree with you.
My house is just across the street.
Let your imagination run wild.
It is easy to work in jeans.
I pushed Tom back into his room.
Did you understand the moral of this story?
I broke my nose.
Tom was born and raised in Boston.
"I went to bed, but I couldn't fall asleep."
Is someone calling me?
Does your country have nuclear weapons?
My sister can't start the day without reading her horoscope.
Did you call a tow truck?
The lights are out.
My English is anything but good.
Tom is a policeman.
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
This road is too narrow for trucks to pass.
I was glad to hear of your success.
That has nothing to do with him.
Neither Tom nor Mary know how to speak French.
You've got the wrong guy.
She hid behind the door and held her breath.
You can use my desk.
I'll show you how to catch a fish.
My dog is really smart.
Is it true that Tom can't swim?
Do you want to drink tea or coffee?
They admired the lovely scenery.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
The debate is continuing.
I cooked supper last night.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I wonder why Tom isn't home.
Are you afraid of insects?
He noticed her embarrassment.
Don't use this pair of scissors.
Tom said that Mary has been having fun doing that.
I can't trust you.
I'll never forget what happened last summer.
It's so nice to be by ourselves.
Mary is my girlfriend.
He apologized to me for his rudeness.
Who is that boy?
My father works for a bank.
I just did what my boss told me to do.
Is it true that Tom and Mary are going to get married?
It's next to impossible to finish it in a day.
Don't beat around the bush.
Tom gave a big yawn.
The young man burst into laughter.
She substituted margarine for butter.
She was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
These apples are for you.
What kind of stone is this?
His story sounds true.
I think he has something to do with that scandal.
"No, thank you."
The teacher and I sat face to face.
You were loved.
I'm going to Europe next week.
I can fly.
We surrender.
Tom told Mary about what he'd done.
Does it have a bathroom?
I told you not to tell anyone.
I'd like you to read this book.
Tom is combing his hair.
Tom went there alone.
It might rain before evening.
Various kinds of flowers will be blooming soon.
There is no hope of his coming back safe.
"After walking for five minutes, we arrived at the park."
Let me help you with your baggage.
You can see the sun peeking through the clouds.
Don't screw around with me.
"Basically, I agree with your opinion."
I went to bed much earlier back then.
This answer almost amounts to a threat.
"Since Tom is honest, I like him."
The system is working very well now.
Look at that girl. She's really cute.
Are cats smarter than dogs?
Tom became a doctor.
He accommodated the traveler for the night.
What's so funny?
Will he be able to come tomorrow?
Please give my book back to me.
Tom is a true sportsman.
It'll be difficult to find a replacement.
Here are the documents you asked for.
Shall we take a cab?
How did it come to this?
This is my hometown.
Can I eat in my room?
Tom called me on the evening of the 20th.
Why's Tom here?
Are you through?
My father gave a nice watch to me.
My grandmother lives in the country.
Does anyone have a charger for an iPhone?
Winter is coming soon.
My watch is accurate.
Why don't you come visit us?
My grandmother made me a new dress.
My son is studying economics.
The students protested against the unfair exam.
He is tired from overwork.
"My wife is a scientist, too."
"Nobody's perfect, except me."
I eat an egg every morning.
Prices are high these days.
I live at Akasaka in Tokyo.
Let's get off the bus.
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
He thinks that he is a great poet.
It's no concern of mine.
I'm simply looking.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
He visited the coast of South America in 1499.
I admire him for his courage.
You should not despise a man because he is poor.
Don't let me down.
I'll come tomorrow without fail.
She gave a ready answer.
Please keep me informed about whatever happens in my absence.
This movie is exciting.
He comes from the middle class.
May I come in?
I'm really tired.
Is Tom still living in Australia?
What's the exact time now?
You can't be too careful about your health.
We'll help you.
I'll come to visit you at your house tomorrow.
We'll visit you one of these days.
My brain doesn't seem to be working well today.
I am thinking of going to the mountains.
Write it in pencil.
Call me at 9 o'clock tomorrow.
I don't believe that ghosts exist.
I wish you had told me that.
You must be back before ten.
I'm waiting for the store to open.
Did you buy a car?
How many books did you borrow?
It was awfully hot yesterday.
I'll see you at 2:30.
Did you see the lunar eclipse yesterday?
He can play the piano better than I can.
Greece was the cradle of western civilization.
Thank you very much for everything.
Only time will tell which one is right.
I should've come earlier.
I don't have time to read.
I can hear a cat scratching at the window.
I stepped aside so he could pass.
I'm also a teacher.
Ten thousand yen will not cover the expenses.
Is there somebody here who speaks French?
I'd rather stay at home than go out.
What was it that you wanted?
Who should I believe now?
The bridge saved us a lot of time.
What are they after?
Do you go running every day?
I'm pleased that you have passed the exam.
Run and hide in the mountains.
I know that Tom can swim.
Is there a gas station near here?
I think Tom would know the answer.
I took a taxi because it was raining.
I really want to meet you.
She didn't know what to do.
The rain has just stopped.
What's your favorite color?
"No matter where Tom goes, he has a good reputation."
It was only a dream.
"After a baseball game, there's nothing better than a beer."
The helicopter is flying very low.
"Does your throat hurt? ""Yes, a little."""
Would you explain it in more detail?
He doesn't like to wait until the last moment to do something.
That knife is very sharp.
We discussed the new plan yesterday.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
Today is my birthday.
I forgot my debit card at home.
"Sorry, but I'm a little slow-witted."
The town is always crawling with tourists.
Tom can't possibly know Mary.
It looks like rain.
I spent a lot of money remodeling my house.
"Tom did it, didn't he?"
Tom swam with the dolphins.
I returned to Japan.
The train will come in at platform ten.
Don't come.
She must be sick.
Do you intend to help Tom?
Tom is more intelligent than me.
Mary bought a skirt and a blouse.
I don't know who to trust anymore.
The road was slippery.
This temple is famous for its cherry blossoms.
You should go home now.
Tom used to bake us cookies.
Japan is a strange country.
I'll do it tomorrow. I promise.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Don't mention this to Tom.
What are you doing today?
I got another job.
Write your name at the bottom of the paper.
I'm not good at fishing.
My house is right across the street.
This tastes like tea.
I can't forgive you.
Are there any Japanese restaurants near here?
Not a soul is here.
Are you going to work until 10:00?
Tom had to cancel his lecture because he was sick.
Tom may need to wait.
"You're new, aren't you?"
We carried our children on our backs.
I need new speakers for my computer.
We moved to New York last fall.
I am at a loss what to do.
Do you have a favorite color?
I have three grown sons.
Tom is praying.
A good idea came into my mind.
Oranges are rich in vitamin C.
He was wrong in thinking that she'd come to see him.
Is that scientifically proven?
I forgot his name.
The price of land in the center of the city is soaring.
Let's change channels. This program isn't very interesting.
Meetings are held every other week.
That's my fiancé.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I don't want to go out.
Where are you off to?
Our teacher gives us a lot of homework.
Children like cake.
I thought Tom might be sick.
I've made a lot of friends since I entered college.
Are you sure Tom isn't allergic to peanuts?
I'll call you later.
She accepted his gift.
I bought a watch and I lost it the next day.
She was a medical student.
Do you know how to fix this TV?
It's a nice day.
Why do I have to work overtime?
Do you like surfing?
I can stay.
Tom can't afford to buy a house.
There's a drinking fountain by the tennis court.
You're not consistent.
I can't find my luggage.
Is there a shopping mall near here?
He is sometimes absent from school.
She's handy with a needle.
He has left his family.
"It took us a long time, but finally we were able to find it."
"Of course, it's a joke."
Some people think talking back to an adult is rude.
My mother is right.
The oven's hot so be careful not to burn yourself.
I told her to stay indoors.
This is all the money I have.
Let's get a picture of us with the sea in the background.
Tom had never used the washing machine before.
Tom just announced that he would be moving to Boston.
Don't act rashly.
There are many new programs to watch this spring.
It's free.
Don't move.
"At the age of seventeen, he fled his native village."
What are you reading?
How many pages does this book have?
There are a lot of toys here.
She had a pleasant dream.
I thought you were going to stay home.
Luckily nobody died.
It is not surprising that he resigned.
The attempt ended in failure.
Many foreigners come to Japan for work.
We met in secret.
Here's a book for your mother to read.
Be proud of yourself.
"Every time he meets me, he brags about his car."
Almost one-third of all office workers wear glasses.
What shall we do today?
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
I'm looking for my dog.
"I'm sorry that I'm late, but I had a lot of things that needed to be done."
You should throw these out.
Were there a lot of people in the library?
"Starting next year, my older brother will be working for a bank."
My brain is full.
Is that your mother?
He advised caution.
This bread is moldy.
He can speak Thai as well as English.
Do you think Tom loves Mary?
Many birds are on the branch.
Tom found the keys he thought he had lost.
"I'm not going, and that's that."
Won't you come in?
He teaches us English.
The tickets I bought are non-refundable.
Have a nice trip!
We must deal with this problem right away.
"As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away."
"The Great Wall of China is more than 5,500 miles long."
I don't know his real name.
I spilled some fruit juice on my new shirt.
It's no big deal.
Tom is crazy.

I wonder how many they need.
You can rely on him.
She showed me which dress to wear.
Can you check if the phone is out of order?
I use it every day.
She's good at getting around rules.
Hurry up.
Housewives have a hundred things to do.
You left your lights on.
Happiness is in the little things.
What's your rush?
What're you planning to do?
I've got a frog in my throat.
I wasn't feeling well and was late for class.
I was up all night studying.

Tom has been living here three years.
My little brother was injured in the accident.
He is very clever for a boy of ten.

Children play in this park every day.
This is the bathroom.
May I see your passport?

Where is the bathroom?
I often look up words in that dictionary.
Do you have a problem with this?
Tom and Mary were always together.
I went to the park yesterday.
Were you serious?

Tom can speak French fluently.
The boy must have broken the window.
She drinks a little wine at times.
What is it that you're afraid of?
I have a wonderful plan.
The bus just left.
Tom appeared from out of nowhere.
"Tom was furious, but he tempered his language because there were children present."
I was sure of it.
"To tell the truth, I'd rather stay at home than go out."
Parallel lines don't intersect each other.

Let Tom try.
"What is important is not how many books you read, but what books you read."
They sat in the front row of the concert hall and heard the orchestra clearly.

Are you going to have dinner at home?
He sat up late last night.
"Which shirt do you like better, the red one or the blue one?"
I will try again.
"Yesterday, the weather was very nice."
What's the big idea?
My mother prepared our lunch.
I confessed my sin.
Was Tom really able to win?
Let's leave her alone.

How are you getting along these days?
Hailing a cab in Manhattan at 5:00 p.m. is nearly impossible.
I like blue.
Let him in.
He has made a significant decision.
You should try that.
It cannot be true.
Why don't you stay in Boston for a few more days?
This library was built in 2013.
I won't see him anymore.
Are they in the gym?
That's a very good idea.
Please send this by special delivery.

I think you should change your profile picture.
I've always liked football.
What's the suitcase's weight?
Are you sure you don't want to go with us?

Is your name really Tom?
She avoided answering my questions.
Eat your soup before it gets cold.
How did you hit upon such an idea?
I'm happy to see you again.
Why did he run away?
Have you ever skipped school?
All the students in my class are friendly.
Will you look after my dog tomorrow?
We were glad to hear of his safe return.
I want to know who killed Tom.
Tom is lazy.
Could you drop me off at the library?
I did what I could.
Has the shipment arrived yet?

It's easy to make and it's cheap.
Tom put on his pajamas and climbed into bed.
There is nothing God cannot do.
It'll snow tomorrow.
What do you plan on doing tomorrow?
I said I'm sorry.
Happy holidays.
Tom felt like dancing.
I know how to make it.
Were there any tickets left?
Tom did that to survive.
The world did not recognize him.
Who's that girl?
Tom seemed cool.
She is my girlfriend.
I have my own theory.
The police dusted the van for fingerprints.
Accidents are inevitable.
Why doesn't Tom like this hotel?
I'm all set to start.
I saw Tom throw something at your dog.
Am I really sick?
Stop arguing about money.

One of my teeth came out.
What will you have?
I'm not a baby.
I won!

I've decided to go.
See you about 7.

Is Tom really married to Mary?
I missed the train by thirty seconds.
"In those days, few people went to college."
Just what do you mean?
He put up his house for sale.
This event isn't open to the public.
Tom slammed on the brakes.
I'll come back for my suitcase this afternoon.
He broke the window on purpose.
His mother said that he had been sick in bed for five weeks.
Haven't you begun yet?
"Oh, take your time. I'm in no hurry."
Why don't you help him?
You can't live without water.
I won't say another word.
She was absent from school with a cold.
"I left home later than usual, but I was still able to catch the train I usually catch."
Could you teach me French?
We managed to swim across the river.
Don't you know I'm going out with Tom?

Can you lower the price?
We have a few surprises in store for her.

The reason for my absence is that I was ill.
Tom said that he'd never eaten such a delicious meal before.
My hair is so messy!
I should have taken the money.
I eat breakfast at eight o'clock.
More than half of the residents are opposed to the plan.
Both Tom and Mary are in their thirties.
My grandmother is still vigorous at 82 years old.

If only I'd noticed that earlier.
I don't want to give up.
I have two cats and one dog.
That's enough for today.

Did you speak at all?
I need to work.
I think Tom is afraid of Mary's dog.
I saw him in the park.
I come here very often.
I am slow to adapt myself to new circumstances.
"I stayed at the hotel, but the others went shopping."
"You're right, I think."
Are you going to the station in a taxi?
What time is it now in Boston?
Is this my fault?
I'd like to study in Paris.
"You love your mother, don't you?"
Tom filled the bathtub with hot water.
Sometimes I doubt your intelligence.
She kept crying all night long.
Which historical figure would you want to meet if you could?
The car started.
"If I knew the truth, I'd tell you."
A strange man was walking back and forth on the pavement.
He jumped out of bed.
It seems I'm going to be up all night tonight.
The new guy's name is Tom.
"If Tom goes, I won't."
My battery is running out.
This is the house where I live.
I've already apologized for doing that.
Don't tell lies. Tell the truth.
Thanks for letting me know.
Tom should have known better than to kiss Mary in public.
The water in this river is very clean.
She's sure to succeed.
It's not my fault.

This is an imitation diamond.
Yes. That's right.
I say that all the time.
I don't want any more.
I hate it when that happens.

What time do we leave?
I got into trouble with the police for driving too fast.
I don't like you anymore.
I check my horoscope every day.
She raised the boy to be a fine person.
Tom isn't as busy as Mary is.
A screen divided the room into two.
He adopted her idea.
Tom and Mary started walking.
I had to sip the coffee because it was too hot.
I don't think that Tom knows that Mary is a vegetarian.
I trust the teacher.
Look up the word in the dictionary for yourself.
The children have gone to school already.
I'd like to be alone now.
She wouldn't let him in.

I'm adding the finishing touches now.
We played soccer yesterday.
I don't like him.
Tom and Mary grew up in Boston.
Get out of this house.
I'm reading things like famous novels which have been rewritten in simplified French.
I did the washing while the baby was sleeping.
"That man was standing a little ways away, but he turned when he heard Tom shout."

Are you still willing to help?
Tom flipped off the lights.
Do your best.
You'd better do it at once.
Why do I have to help Tom?

Oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I was just trying to help.
There's a funny smell in this room.
I think that's correct.
He had a strong alibi.

He bound old letters into a bundle.
Tom isn't afraid of spiders.
"Durian stinks, but it's said to be very healthy."

Do you have anything to declare?
Let's discuss the problem with them.

Tom is plastered.
Nobody thinks about it.
Whose glass is this?

My life is full of regrets.
My father is in.
I figured out how to do that on my own.
There's a lot of snow in the park today.
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
He left the house without so much as saying goodbye.
I'm really pleased with my new car.
I wonder where Tom went.
Don't talk so loud.
It's so cold in here.
Yesterday was Thursday.
Please speak louder.
Why don't we go out next weekend?
You must do it yourself.
"Don't say anything, OK?"
"When I saw her recently, she looked very happy."
You need to do that right now.
I'm so lonely.
I'd been working for two hours when I suddenly felt sick.
"No, that's not true."
Somehow you don't sound too good today. Is anything the matter?
I want to send a message to my friend Tom.
"Does she have a dog? ""No, she doesn't."""
I hope not.
He fell into a deep sleep.
Have you heard from him?
Do you mean that you've never seen a panda?
Who is that man?
When will you call me?
Do you really care when I get this done as long as I get it done?
She is in the habit of writing in her diary every day.
Are you calling me a thief?
He was present at the meeting.
She was on her way to school.
My girlfriend dumped me.
I'm afraid that we're going to be late for school.
He would often swim in this river.
How did your weekend go?
Are you planning to take part in the meeting?
Tom is absent.
I thought nothing of it at the time.
Show me where the pain is.
I was feeling blue all day.
I'm catching the 11:00 train.
Do you know where Tom is?
He goes to the office by car.
Won't you come and see me next week?
I'll call tomorrow morning.

I left the key in the room.
Write it in French.

Do you want to take a walk?
Tom doesn't know when Mary is leaving Boston.
I'm sure Tom will come back soon.

I could not find it anyplace.
"You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours."
"It was cloudy, so I took an umbrella with me."
May I use your toilet?
I'm really out of it today. It must be because of my fever.
I'll let you know my new address.
The restaurant is always packed.
They embarked on the new project full of hope.
I can't keep pace with you.
He's very interested in Japanese.
Tom caught a mouse.
I'm sure that she will not come to see you.
"Welcome home, Tom."
My backpack is very heavy.
I thought we all had plans tonight.
She's far better off than she was the year before last.
I'll burn the midnight oil tonight.
The book is now ready for publication.
Are Tom and Mary still there?
How about around 3:00 p.m. on February 28th?
Tom went splashing through the shallows.
Were either of your parents born in Australia?
It's cold here.
I heard you're looking for a job.
He sat listening to the radio.
"Tom doesn't have a pet now, but he used to have a dog."
Can your mom drive a car?
Tom spent all day goofing off.
Everybody loves him.
We took advantage of the good weather to play tennis.
I had an unexpected experience.
Tom is just like his father.
Do you know the reason why she is so angry?
Lending money to such a fellow is as good as throwing it away.
Don't talk!
Put your trousers on.
Do you have a student ID?
"Are those your books? ""No, they aren't."""
I've been lucky.
The news of his son's death was a great shock.
This is certainly surprising.
I have no idea how long it'll take.
It rained five successive days.
I'm sorry.
I can't remember the last time I laughed.
Why don't you get into the pool?
I read The Great Gatsby when I was in high school.
Our goal is to build thirty houses before the end of the year.
Let me make you some coffee.
"You can't say no to Tom, can you?"
Tom reached for the dictionary on the top shelf.
Don't play baseball here.
I live with my two children.
The flight was canceled due to heavy fog.
Tom didn't like Mary from the start.
The loss will amount to one hundred million dollars.
Our native language is Japanese.
You promised not to do that again.
Tom's curtains were closed.
He was delighted to see you.
Tom made us wait a long time.
He often appears on TV.
We do not know him.
Could you please pass me the pepper?
Don't let your imagination run wild.
Why are you angry?
I'm having a very hard time.
Tell me. I'm all ears.
"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride."
She lives on her own.
This is how I made it.
I'll think about it.
I'll heat up the soup for you.
Why are you wearing a tux?
I wish I could figure out how to control my appetite.
"Don't fall asleep. If you fall asleep, you'll die."
I laughed so much my stomach hurts.
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
"It cost me 5,000 yen to repair my bicycle."
Tom's rude reply provoked Mary to slap his face.
He checked the documents carefully.
Do it the way you've been told to do it.
It happens to the best of us.
Do you think I'm a cute kid?
I want a drink of water.
Please bill us separately.
Is this camera for sale?
Please limit your presentation to 30 minutes.
Don't raise your voice at me.
I hid in the tall grass.
"He said that if he knew her address, he would write to her."
I'm certain of that.
Excuse me for interrupting you.
They armed themselves with rifles.
I like mahjong.
Let's go someplace warm.
What time did you get home last night?
She crossed the street.
Tom is wearing short pants.
Please take off your hat.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
I shouldn't have lied to Tom.
Tom is my best friend.
Gum got stuck to the bottom of my shoe.
You can come and get it today.
Fasten the gate.
This machine was manufactured in France.
"You're married, aren't you?"
Tom turns thirteen in two days.
You shouldn't snack between meals.
Tom appeared relieved.
I don't like bread crust.
Tom looks very sleepy.
Memorize the poem by next week.
I got my hair done yesterday.
Tom asks us the same questions all the time.
She is five years old.
This factory makes car parts.
Tom picked Mary up the same way a man carries his new bride across the threshold and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
Tom has never been good at baseball.
I think I'm a good cook.
"According to statistics, world population is on the rise."
Tom arrived yesterday.
How's married life?
Where's the ticket counter?
I'm very glad you didn't get hurt.
This place is an accident waiting to happen.
My back feels stiff.
"How about another piece of pie, Tom?"
Is this drinking water?
I went swimming with Tom.
"Trust me, he said."
She likes music very much.
Take the weight off your feet.
What did you try to do?
Her way of speaking irritates us.
I'm not too tired.
Wait a sec.
Mold grew on the boots.
Please send me a letter.
Tom takes care of Mary.
Tom started taking his shoes off.
I've lived here all my life.
May I take a message for him?
This piano has probably not been tuned for years.
I don't remember when I last cleaned it.
I bought a new suit.
You'd better see the doctor.
May I open the window?
"The more I know him, the more I like him."
It was dark in the room.
The townspeople looked curiously at me.
I hope you'll be happy forever.
Why isn't Tom here at this crucial moment?
Tom hugged his father.
Please take off your shirt.
It doesn't look expensive.
He achieved his aim of studying abroad.
I belong to a swimming club.
This is the house where Tom was born.
Does that name ring a bell?
She felt like crying.
He was in a traffic accident.
Tom can't see without glasses.
May I come to see you at your office tomorrow morning?
He is a rude person.
Stick with me until we get out of the crowd.
Do you have a toothache?
I've been looking for my keys all day.
"You studied hard for the test, didn't you?"
Tom let out a big sigh.
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
You're right about that.
"After dinner, we take a walk on the beach."
I'm going to bed.
"You lied to me, didn't you?"
Everybody is wearing a mask.
I don't think this is a very good idea.
Don't cut down these trees.
We must pay taxes.
I was dizzy.
"If you cook, I'll do the washing-up."
Tom had to admit defeat.
There hasn't been any rain for two months.
"Come in, the door's open."
The tongue of a cat feels rough.
A revised edition of the encyclopedia was published.
Please tell me where to go next.
Tom bent down and picked something up.
That sounds really interesting.
Tom needs an interpreter.
Tom is in the restroom.
Who spoke French?
He speaks English like a native.
My grades have improved since first semester.
Look at it.
Am I missing something?
Is Tom better at French than Mary?
Tom closed the door quietly and tiptoed into the room.
World War I broke out in 1914.
The dog must be hungry.
My whole body was in pain.
"For the time being, let's sit here."
Why not try it on?
My favorite drink is coffee.
They abandoned the fort to the enemy.
He is good at gymnastics.
This is worth one million yen.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I spent a lot of money on the house.
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
It's time to take my pills.
I know her address.
Tom doesn't like potato salad.
I'm going to kiss Tom.
Tom has started to write a novel.
I bought a book about animals.
Even a child knows that.
I'm nervous.
Tom and I have an arrangement.
Women often wear skirts.
Tom answered some of the questions.
The summit of the mountain is covered with snow.
This hotel can accommodate 500 guests.
I'm going home now.
Tom stopped talking as soon as he noticed Mary wasn't listening anymore.
We went for a walk in the forest.
Pandas are cute.
He sat next to the stream.
"Meat, please."
I usually eat lunch here.
Is it OK if we use calculators?
I looked in the cupboard.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Are there any risks?
This is all the money I have now.
There are more than six billion people in the world.
Tom thought Mary was lying.
I've been there before.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
I've decided to study French.
Will you come back home soon?
I love mushrooms.
The floor was covered with blood.
There was nobody in the room.
I wish I had a better memory.
What's that bird called?
Can I have this orange?
I live very near here.
Have you ever gone to Boston?
There are some stores that will discount the price.
Is that a real tree?
The river is very low.
We wandered round the shopping center.
Have you read today's paper?
You have no right to pass judgement on these people.
I'll go if the weather's good.
May I turn on the lights?
"He's a famous physicist not only in Japan, but throughout the world."
They hated each other.
"There was a sale on apples today, so I bought a lot."
Don't tell lies.
I found my name written on the blackboard.
Tom didn't tell me about this.
Those heels are really high.
I think it's unlikely that plants feel pain.
"Mom, can I go swimming?"
That's a good answer.
I think that Tom is introverted.
It may snow.
Who is that guy?
My father allowed me to go swimming.
I didn't find it funny at all.
I can't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
Have a good time.
She will leave for New York next Sunday.
Do you have a picture of Tom?
All living things will die someday.
He was expelled from school.
"When I hear that song, I think about the place where I grew up."
"I looked around, but saw nobody."
Anyone can do that.
Tell me about it.
We'll purchase a new car next week.
She has a bag under her arm.
He could not live up to expectations.
Tom isn't smart enough to do something like that.
Help me move this stone.
I have a ton of stuff to do.
Many villagers were killed by soldiers.
What was Mary's last name before she got married?
Have you seen my coat?
It's the end of the year.
I found my father's diary which he kept for 30 years.
He's not cut out for teaching.
I'd be delighted if you could come with us.
Please be sure to let me know your new address soon.
Does Tom like spaghetti?
Can you recommend a good book?
I'm a baker.
The phone rang.
"Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning."
I'm sorry for you.
The breakfast menu hasn't changed for decades.
I went down by elevator.
They say he is very rich.
Do you drink alcohol?
"Even though I'm sitting here in the sun, I still feel cold."
How many apples are there?
"I was busy packing, because I was leaving for France in two days."
"If you don't want to go, you don't need to."
He saved me from danger.
Please bring me a clean knife.
When will you get married?
Were you there when the fire started?
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Neither of us can drive.
How far is it from here to the airport?
Brokers struggling to make a profit don't always play by the book.
I have no idea what that is.
I saw him go into the toilet a few minutes ago.
"Which do you like better, summer or winter?"
Where did I put my reading glasses?
We should've departed earlier.
The rain finally stopped.
The question is where to buy the book.
I have a slight fever.
There's a lot of traffic on that street.
Tom drinks a lot.
"Give me a hand, please."
Who is the boy swimming in the river?
I got tired of lying in bed all day.
Shall I help you?
What unanswered questions remain?
Have you ever shot a gun before?
"When the time is ripe, be bold and go for it! I'll stand by you."
He was beside himself with joy.
I have a terrible toothache.
Tom is one of the best golfers I know.
Can you show me that picture?
I can't believe Tom knows where Mary lives.
Tom is pessimistic.
I plan to stay in Australia for three days.
You're all talk and no action!
"I want to buy a new laptop, but I don't have the money."
I can wait no longer.
I'm busy now.
It takes fifteen minutes to walk from here to the campus.
Their house is far from the station.
Mary is a tomboy.
Tom has fallen for Mary's trap.
I think you worry too much.
Wake the children up.
Don't forget to take your medication.
Stay at home.
Perhaps I'm wrong.
The bread is still hot.
We still have plenty of time left.
I am tired of my work.
I didn't want to stay home all day.
He thinks that planes are safer than cars.
"This book is mine, not Tom's."
The town is famous for its hot spring.
"Actually, I didn't know that."
I keep a journal.
"He said he would write to me, but he hasn't."
He encountered a friend on the road.
He admonished his son for being lazy.
I appreciate you stopping by.
People who ignore history tend to repeat it.
That looks like a model gun.
What did you say?
Don't come back here again.
The weather turned better.
You can do it.
Nobody argued against choosing him as chairman.
What're you all looking at?
"After finishing lunch, we went skating."
Why did you think Tom liked heavy metal?
She didn't tell me her name.
He drank himself to death.
"If he had taken my advice, he would now be rich."
I pricked my thumb with a needle.
I think Tom hates Mary.
I don't have an older brother.
I have no money on me.
Tom isn't John's twin.
I think that that book isn't so interesting.
Tom said you spoke French.
What should we say to Tom?
I've never seen him in jeans.
The news made me happy.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
When was the last time you went on a date?
You must not give up.
"When I got up, it was snowing outside."
Tom was the one who cooked breakfast.
The context is crucial.
This tree is about 300 years old.
"Last summer, I worked part time on the farm."
Tom cut his hand when he fell.
"If it's fine tomorrow, we'll go on a picnic."
The rich are not always happy.
I want to go and see cherry trees blooming.
"I have no job, so I can never save money."
I think what you're saying is correct.
Tom said that he had been cleaning the house all day.
You can always count on him in any emergency.
I wrote my name on the paper.
Are you really a police officer?
Where will you be staying?
Tell Tom I'm sorry that I hurt him.
That's impossible.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
He acted like a madman.
You speak so quietly I can barely hear you.
A monster lay on a rock near the top of the mountain.
There's a skunk on the porch.
They split up after a year of marriage.
My apartment is near here.
Is there anything you want to do this weekend?
Bookmark this site.
What's happening tonight?
Your kid bit me.
He's an absolute fool.
Is it OK if I eat this hamburger?
We'll all die sooner or later.
I always get nervous in her presence.
French is her first language.
Tom doesn't need to do that.
Tom is running.
Mary's my niece.
I think it's better to stay here.
I've ordered a book from Amazon.com.
I want to eat fresh fish.
I had my bike repaired yesterday.
Tom is going to be here until noon.
Don't underestimate me.
It looks like rain.
Are you sick?
Is there a photo shop in the hotel?
I'm immediately behind her.
Only six people were present at the party.
Dinner is ready!
I finally got a driver's license.
You promised that you'd do that with me.
This winter has been mild.
All thirty people on board died.
What horrible weather!
Don't be noisy here.
He called at my house.
Do you have some kind of hobby?
We postponed our departure because of the storm.
What'd the doctor say?
"When we were kids, we played together every day."
How many times has Japan hosted the Olympics?
He lay on the mat at full length.
He changed his name to Tom.
I have to get this done today.
I have a great deal to do.
I can't look at Tom.
I can barely understand what you're talking about.
"You've never been in love, have you?"
There is a clock on the wall.
Stop talking about this.
Isn't that a girl's name?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
It really depends on when.
I'm a member of the baseball team.
Tom linked to my website from his blog.
She wants to be a tennis player when she grows up.
This is a fantastic idea.
It has started raining.
My friends celebrated my birthday.
Beauty is but skin deep.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I don't think that Tom did this.
There are various reasons.
There's no such thing as a money tree.
I haven't laughed in a long time.
What'll you do with it?
Vegetables have gone up in price.
Thank you for the wonderful dinner.
"Where's the wrench that you were using yesterday? ""It was there earlier. Have you asked Mary? Maybe she has it."""
I can't afford to take a day off.
This car is my father's.
I have to study.
He is as strong as ever.
What exactly is the difference?
It's getting dark outside.
Tom is a little more patient than me.
She's trying to repaint her house.
I concocted an excuse for missing the party.
There are many rivers on that island.
I didn't mean to give you that impression.
Do you want to talk about it or not?
When was the last time you went fishing with Tom?
How many people are there in your family?
Those are my books.
"I'd like three twenties, six fives, and the rest in ones."
"In both appearance and personality, Tom is exactly like his father."
He turned up an hour later.
They agreed on a price.
I left your umbrella on the bus.
He is proud of the fact that he has never consulted a doctor in his life.
I won't lie.
I know you are rich.
We play volleyball every Monday.
We must clean up the kitchen.
It's dinner time.
Be serious.
It was very interesting.
I'm not in the mood to go out right now.
We plan to leave tomorrow.
I wish that every day were Saturday.
"As we get older, we have a harder time keeping up with new technology."
I don't think we can do that.
My parents never let me go to my friends' houses.
I don't care for wine.
I wasn't in time for school this morning.
Are you certain it was an accident?
She is wearing a nice watch.
It's hard to explain.
May I say it in French?
I've been spending a lot of time at home recently.
I'll teach you French if you teach me English.
Can I help in any way?
Don't die.
Boys run fast.
I laughed so hard I almost cried.
I'll have Tom go right away.
It is impossible for us to cross that river.
Our dog ​​is really clever.
It looks like a nice place to live.
I don't have a microwave oven.
We haven't had much rain this year.
Close the door.
You may invite whoever wants to come.
"No matter what you say, I'll do it my way."
I got some sand in my eye.
You can watch TV after supper.
Do you have any other requests?
I'm going to driving school.
This is surprising.
I'm so happy for you guys.
I had some pudding for an afternoon snack.
Did you not know that?
Are you prepared for the worst?
Bring the washing in.
We will have a math quiz tomorrow.
The prophecy came to pass.
Tom sings better than you.
Yesterday I was caught in a shower on my way home.
I want to become a lawyer.
The plants must've died because nobody watered them.
What did you see?
I got out of the taxi.
She's not the marrying type.
Her son is a mama's boy. He has to be with her all the time.
I'm coming back next week.
How high is Mt. Fuji?
Get out.
Why people do that is beyond me.
There's a hole in the bottom of the bucket.
Tom was talking louder than he needed to.
I'll bring my sister when I come next time.
Tom was grinning.
The government will provide interest-free loans to firms that participate in the program.
"For Tom, getting fired was an unexpected shock."
"He's very smart, so everybody likes him."
I'm not good at multitasking.
They looked very happy.
Are you waiting for anybody?
I opened it and found it empty.
He traveled around the country.
Give me your telephone number.
Those apples aren't ripe yet.
I'm in the classroom.
Please say hello to your parents.
Could I please borrow your pen?
The station is nearby.
Tom turned on the lights.
Does anybody have an iPhone charger?
It's not easy writing a love letter in English.
Would 9 o'clock be all right?
I forgot to buy a birthday cake.
Tom's phone rang.
Can I stay at your place for a while?
Tom didn't think his boss's plan was a viable one.
Do you subscribe to any magazines?
Tom moved.
I'm an early riser.
I don't think Tom was involved in the scandal.
Tom has volunteered.
Can you hear the frogs croaking?
"That's your problem, not mine."
I hope that you will like it.
"Next time I see you, please give me your answer."
"I can play chess, but I can't play checkers."
Tom was the life of the party.
Do you want fruit juice?
Cats are animals.
We invited him to our house.
That isn't her real name.
She came home in low spirits.
I've been to the post office.
Can you zip me up?
Do you eat seaweed in your country?
Tom has been working for the same website design company for years.
Stop talking loudly.
I don't want to go outside.
I doubt that Tom will get here on time.
Tom cleaned the toilet.
This is strictly between us.
There is only one truth.
Tom is in a bad mood so it's best if you stay away from him.
Tom hasn't cooked the eggs yet.
Who did you meet there?
I'm sure it was an accident.
You'll feel better after a hot cup of tea.
One of the answers is correct.
Are you free Monday night?
I hate interviews.
I want a friend.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Will you please put the baby to bed?
You're much prettier than I remember.
Are they the people you saw yesterday?
How sad!
Could you please repeat it slowly?
Have you ever seen Tom when he's mad?
Put on some sunscreen.
Tom shared his piece of cake with Mary.
This is the first time I've heard that word.
There are two chickens in the backyard and two in the front yard.
He never tells lies.
Tom started getting impatient and frustrated.
How much do these pants cost?
Eat wherever you want.
The baby cried herself to sleep.
I can't keep doing this.
I'm just living from day to day.
I was homeless at the time.
I have something that I want to say to you.
The castle is across the river.
Babies cry when they're hungry.
The person in the middle had a gun.
A good idea occurred to me then.
Is this your book?
Tom drinks.
What's his name again?
Where have you been lately?
"Red wine, please."
Tom has never seen Mary so angry.
Tell me the reason you were absent from school yesterday.
It's hard to get a job in this country.
I can be there in thirty minutes.
Tom will be going back to Boston tomorrow.
Did you bring your ID card with you?
Don't read while eating.
The medicine is hard to swallow.
I got up at six.
I guess I've come at a bad time.
Tom said he'd never tried water skiing.
There are many Japanese restaurants in New York.
Make sure that the door is locked before you leave.
"I always raise my hand, but the teacher never calls on me."
The young man came running to meet her.
Is it true Tom used to be rich?
Tom fell in the pool.
Can you bring my trunk down from upstairs?
Tom pulled an MP3 player out of his bag.
Tom is making some french toast.
"Unfortunately, my mother isn't at home."
I just wanted Tom to be happy.
Your blood pressure is low.
That boy speaks like an adult.
May I use your toilet?
The old school building burned down.
I'd like to go to London someday.
I'd never commit suicide.
Tom is more experienced in business than I am.
There is little water left in the canteen.
The hotel was burned down.
I had a bad dream.
Did you bring wine?
Don't believe what she says.
How are you doing?
Tom has stopped smoking.
Mary is a dish.
The news that he died was a shock to me.
I couldn't understand his joke.
My whole body itches.
They built this library in 2013.
"Sister, don't let this patient out of your sight."
They work in the fields.
Tom can hardly speak any French.
I have lunch with the manager almost every day.
Would you like to take in a movie?
"If you'd told me about it earlier, I could've been free. However, tomorrow I have plans to go back home."
I just want to visit Tom.
Each year is different.
This book sells well in Japan.
I was very sleepy.
When are you planning to return?
Bad habits die hard.
You dropped your handkerchief.
Tom can speak French pretty well.
Let's get takeout.
Where's my mama?
Let's draw lots to decide who goes first.
I go to school by bus.
Tom likes oranges.
The weather promises to clear up.
I forgot to lock the drawer.
I'm the youngest.
Thank you for helping me write my resume.
I have to take two pills every six hours.
I need something to write with.
"The station is near, so let's walk."
How much time do you intend to stay in Boston?
Mind if I join you?
I thought that you said you were afraid to do that.
"Tom was supposed to come with us, but he didn't show up."
I was young at the time.
I knew that you had a girlfriend.
I just can't believe they're getting married.
There are many wild animals in this area.
I haven't touched a tennis racket in years.
I'm getting along with my mother-in-law very well.
I'm a locksmith.
He added up the figures.
Tom deserved everything he got.
I don't know what'll happen.
"When the weather had cleared, the children began to play baseball again."
Can I call home?
I'm no longer a child.
Tom is waiting for you.
Does that clock work?
How did you pay for this computer?
Where did I put my keys?
Are you interested in Japanese music?
It's a comedy movie.
I should head out.
"He told me his address, but unfortunately I had no paper to write it down on."
Be careful not to catch a cold.
It's very humid.
I'm very short of money.
There were many children in the room.
She can speak French.
I am in favor of your proposal.
He stood up and took a deep breath.
Hurry up or you'll miss the train.
The heater is broken.
I'm busy.
Did you ever see that movie?
Tom is a liar.
She called me many times.
Tom has already finished his lunch.
Buckle down and get to work. Do you think we're on a Sunday picnic here?
He was tired from his long walk.
That makes no difference.
You should go home now.
Tom was worried about his friend.
This is my third time in Boston.
I bought myself a hat in that store.
We wear uniforms at our school.
He is an able engineer.
It has stopped raining.
Is that enough?
I didn't know Mary was Tom's daughter.
What anime do you recommend?
He succeeded because he worked hard.
They agreed to look into the causes of the accident.
How is your wife?
Tom played the piano and Mary sang.
What's your favorite way to spend time in Boston?
I want to raise my son the way my father raised me.
Mary fluctuates between having an exaggerated sense of her own importance and an inferiority complex.
I'm no longer a teacher.
Where's the shirt that I bought you?
Tom rode the roller coaster.
Where's the ticket counter?
"Where are you going? ""To get a stapler."" ""What's wrong with this one?"" ""It's out of staples."""
Don't be too dependent on others.
Please tell me. I really want to hear it.
I'm sure Tom won't lend me his car.
It's been raining since last night.
Can you get off work tomorrow?
I hope that you have a good time in Europe.
Have you ever traveled by plane?
Can you change the room for me?
I ran as fast as I could.
I'm not asleep yet.
She owes him a lot of money.
Was someone in that room?
Tom said he was sorry.
You cannot learn the truth unless you hear what both parties have to say.
We saw a bird in the distance.
We're not open on Thanksgiving.
Can I rest a little?
They announced that a storm was coming.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
This tea is too bitter.
The taxi abruptly turned left.
I still haven't had enough to drink.
It's a long way to Boston.
"As soon as he arrived at the airport, he phoned his office."
"When I returned to the parking lot, my car's windshield had a crack in it."
I stared at the man.
Would you like something to drink?
I was just about to go out when the phone rang.
Stay thin.
We have breakfast in the kitchen.
The bubble burst.
I hear that the number of the unemployed has been increasing recently.
What's the point?
What would you like to eat?
I thought you might come.
Let me take your temperature.
He's different than he used to be.
I'd rather not do that today.
Scorpions are dangerous.
Get a move on.
Tom passed away three years ago.
"If you set the table, I'll get dinner ready."
"You've already decided not to go, haven't you?"
Let's be friends again.
My mother can't come.
I drink coffee without adding milk.
I have a lot of things to do today.
It's incredibly annoying.
Tom admitted that he had no idea where his wife was.
"As I was leaving the house, Tom called."
That name rang a bell.
I've never had such a large sum of money.
Please forget what we talked about earlier.
Can you cook a meal?
Don't quit.
Are you telling me to kill Tom?
I appreciate your help.
Massive amounts of carbon dioxide are generated every day.
Tom ate a bagel with cream cheese.
You don't sound convinced.
The humidity is quite high.
Are you angry at Tom?
Tom is ignoring me.
Barking dogs seldom bite.
Are all the windows shut?
Which one do you think is correct?
My parents objected to my studying abroad.
Tom hurt his knee when he fell down.
He's had many unhappy experiences.
My older brother was treated badly.
He sat smoking on the bench.
How many are there?
We must clean up the kitchen.
He was very excited.
Which one is mine?
Is Tom really going to go to Australia by himself?

She agreed with my idea.

Are you through with your breakfast?
What a waste of money!

I know the perfect place to do that.
This must be good news.
It was overcast yesterday.

I can see why Tom likes Mary.
I like the smell of pizza.
How was the trip?
Tom pretended to be Mary's friend.
It's a piece of cake.
Do you have to stay at home today?
He angrily tore up the letter from her.
Is it clear?
"If you climb up that hill, you can see the ocean."
She sings as well as plays the piano.
Their eyes met.
I thought you'd agree.
What number bus do I take?
No Canadian would ever say that.
They painted the window frames yellow.
Old people need something to live for.
Did you turn the living room light off?
I have heartburn.
Mary rubbed her forehead.
I couldn't get out of my garage because there was a car in the way.
This is a watch made in Japan.
How do you plan to get home?
I wish I were clever.
It is a book.
Hi.
Did you know about this?
Who gave it to you?
It'd be better if you didn't associate with men like that.
The rumor is true to some extent.
I spent all day at home today.
May I kiss you?

He should have finished it by now.
I can speak French well.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
I had my hands full taking care of my own children.

There are more stars in the sky than I can count.
Someone entered the room.
I think it's unhealthy to eat more than 20 oranges a day.
He gave me back the money.
It is raining.
I got my eyes tested.
What happened?
Tom deserves to know what happened.
My father's gone fishing.
What a big dog!
"In Japan, there are lots of hot springs."
He's eating an apple.
We should rest for a minute.
Can you remember the first time you went swimming?
Drink less and sleep more.
What's the average temperature here?
Tom will probably tell his friends that he's going to Boston.
I spent yesterday reading instead of going out.
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the monkey.
Will you make a list of issues to discuss?
It can't be repaired.
Tom swims almost as well as Mary.
You're soaking wet.
They are beginning their homework.
Nobody has come up yet.
I haven't spoken with anybody today.
Winter's coming.
"It's really humid, isn't it?"
This is my sister's.
I can wait four days at the longest.

He just returned from abroad.
Is French taught in schools in Australia?

May I ask you a personal question?
This book is not available in Japan.
Will you take part in the ceremony?
I looked up the words in my dictionary.
What kind of places do you like?
Do you know the lyrics?
This is an excellent wine.
These figures indicate three in five college first-year students are indifferent to politics.
Tom certainly has a nice voice.
"You drink beer, don't you?"
The fire started in the kitchen.
Is this an express?
I don't like homework.
You're going to be OK.
Almost everyone that I know can speak French.
Tom and I went to the same high school.
Water has zero calories.
Which company do you work for?
I didn't know where I should wait for her.
What are you doing?
The origin of the fire is unknown.
"In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult."
I started this job last summer.
"As requested, we are submitting our final report."
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
It's time to go home.
The branch broke under the weight of the snow.
I don't eat the crust.
This newspaper has a large circulation.
Did you get hurt in the football game?
I suppose it's going to rain this evening.
Don't talk about business at dinner.
Tom put some butter on his toast.
I go to school on foot.
The soldiers got to the foot of the hill before dawn.
My father used to eat at this restaurant.
The town was exactly the same as before.
The air conditioner is out of order.
I can't do my work without my computer.
The house was built several hundred years ago.
He finally kicked the bad habit.
Tom is the same age as Mary.
I'd prefer not to do that right now.
He was sentenced to death.
I'll do the same thing that you do.
I must make a call.
Tom went for a walk with Mary.
I'm sorry I made you cry yesterday.
Might is right.
"Don't get angry, OK?"
He became rich.
She told her superior what she thought.
I like your motorbike.
He went to the United States to study English.
It's part of my morning routine.
It was a nasty trick.
That's why I was absent from school yesterday.
Would you care for something to drink?
I've already heard this story.
You may use my car.
Tom was directly in front of me.
Your efforts will pay off one day.
"I ought to go there, but I won't."
She was occupied with household work.
He kept his hat on.
I was fast asleep when the alarm rang.
I'm sure that it'll be fun.
Neither Tom nor Mary can play the clarinet.
What made her do that?
I had no idea of what she intended to do.
It depends on how tight it is.
I received an item that I didn't order.
Just don't go.
"Is that really true? ""Yeah, probably."""
I'm having a hard time with German grammar.
"With Christmas just around the corner, I should do some shopping."
You don't need to suffer in silence.
I've been to Boston numerous times.
"If you hadn't had my advice, you would have failed."
I really like this house.
She's a cutie.
Tom has never killed anybody.
What do you say to calling it a day?
I don't want to be a burden.
I thought that you'd agree.
Tom did well in his own way.
We ate sandwiches for breakfast.
Tom kissed Mary in front of everybody.
Look both ways before you cross the street.
Sing a song with me.
I didn't have the heart to tell him the truth.
I promise I'll mop the floor tomorrow morning.
I think it's important to keep promises.
This could happen to anybody.
I ate lunch in a hurry.
I can't sleep at night.
What do you do in Japan?
"Before you cross the street, look both left and right."
Tom was killed in a plane crash.
Are you done with your homework yet?
Watch your step.
"You have lovely eyes, don't you?"
There's nothing like ice cream in the summer.
"At last, we reached our destination."
Why didn't you look at the picture?
Christmas is fast approaching.
Don't you think you're a bit old to go trick-or-treating?
He's a world-famous writer.
You should go there this week.
Can you tell me when the next bus will arrive?
The train was delayed for an hour.
Please wait a bit.
Paper burns quickly.
Is Tom left-handed?
You'd better not drink the tap water.
Men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 have the most stressful lives.
It rained nonstop.
Tom started playing golf when he was thirteen.
Nuclear power is used to generate electricity.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
He stole a glance at the girl.
I'm interested in photography.
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
He was standing at the side of the road.
I will never forget your kindness as long as I live.
"This is really cool, isn't it?"
I'm stuffed!
At one time it was thought impracticable for man to fly.
I'm tired.
It'll be easy to find a renter for this house.
Thanks anyway.
He translated a Japanese novel into French.
"Come on, try again."
I've just started playing tennis.
I'm tired now.
I think it tastes good.
I told him to be quiet.
"This is mine, and this is yours."
He has red spots all over his body.
Have you sent the email yet?
"I arrived at the stadium at 4:00 p.m., but the game had already started."
I have to take the dog out for a walk.
Mary says she's thinking about getting married.
What color is this?
Have you ever lent Tom money?
I don't think I can do this without your help.
I traded in my old car for a new one.
Could you just give me a minute?
I used to try really hard to get straight A's.
I bought a new suit of clothes.
I gave Tom the money he wanted.
Don't interrupt when others are talking.
It's eight o'clock at night.
There was a fire in this town last night.
I had my suitcase carried to my room.
Do what you like.
You look as though nothing has happened to you.
I can't decide where to eat lunch.
Why didn't you call me before you came?
"Hey, you seem a bit down."
Is this your first visit?
Both Tom and John married younger women.
Here is a letter for you.
What's happened?
Please remove your shoes before entering the house.
My native language is French.
What's this flower called?
It's on the sofa.
I need your passport and three pictures.
"What's that sound? ""It sounds like a woodpecker."""
Is there something in particular that you want to study?
He will win the first prize.
Tom turned off the computer.
She knew better than to smoke a cigarette in his presence.
Don't throw in the towel.
She prides herself on her skill in cooking.
I have read this book before.
Forty people can't fit in here.
Did you drink milk today?
Are you afraid of bugs?
Something did happen.
I've lost three kilograms.
This sentence is in the present tense.
Tom couldn't stop talking about it.
Tom is playing over there.
The atomic number for iron is 26.
He came back after dark.
Have you finished it already?
It was a week before she got well.
"Who's better at baseball, Tom or John? ""Well, I think they're about the same."""
"In those days, I made it a point to take a walk before breakfast."
The dress Mary was wearing was white.
Oranges have a high vitamin content.
"At last, they were reconciled."
How much does this shirt cost?
I was roused by the sound of a bell.
The snow prevented me from going out.
A smile is the best cure for a bad mood.
Don't play catch in the room.
She is trying to save as much money as she can.
I think that's better.
This room looks like a pigsty.
It's not as cold today as it was yesterday.
Cats are smart.
Who was sitting here?
I'd like to rent your most inexpensive car for a week.
Someone has left a bag on the bench.
Please don't waste water.
Items with a red price tag are on sale.
She tried to make both ends meet.
He's had many bad experiences.
Tom isn't as fat as he was before.
Let's play basketball after school.
She comes to school in her car.
This university was founded in 1843.
We used to talk over a cup of coffee.
Only the strong survive.
All humanity will suffer if a nuclear war breaks out.
We were glad to hear Tom got back safely.
"If you have a fever, it would be a good idea to go to the hospital right away."
"Do you still need the light on, or can I turn it off?"
Who's next?
I can't keep pace with you.
Be punctual.
I can't keep my coat on in this heat.
My ankle is swollen.
Let's split the bill today.
Hi. How are you?
Tom says he's busy today.
Tom is sound asleep.
All you have to do is to write your name and address here.
Dinner's ready!
I think she can't answer.
There was an awkward silence when he appeared.
I can't afford to shop at such an expensive store.
They say seeing is believing.
I had a tooth pulled a week ago.
She has a bottle of milk every morning.
"When I was a child, I used to play in that park."
Take a seat. You look tired.
You're old enough to know this.
"She promised that she would pay me this week, but she didn't keep her word."
Do you want to be rich?
There's no one in the house.
The exam was too difficult for me.
Do you have a car?
Mow the lawn.
This supermarket is cheaper than the one I usually go to.
"I've apologized, so get off my back."
It's Tom's turn to speak.
Aren't you glad Tom isn't here?
Tom couldn't make it to school because of the typhoon.
I don't like either of them.
I'll drive you anywhere you need to go.
I noticed that she was wearing new glasses.
I broke your ashtray.
There were few people on the beach.
I have nothing to write.
I'm a junior in high school.
The men are smiling on cue.
We bought a house.
Just a minute.
Have you worked out the answer yet?
I don't care if it's a bit cold.
I'm in Hong Kong right now.
We'll be staying in a hotel.
He nodded yes.
Who runs the fastest of the three?
I want to buy a new trombone.
There are no parking spaces left.
Please wait thirty minutes.
She looked like she'd been drinking.
I don't wash my hair in the morning.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
Are all of them ready?
I have nothing to say about it.
Help Mary take her coat off.
Why do you think Tom and Mary are planning to get divorced?
You have to clean your room.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
"Isaac Newton was born on December 25, 1642."
Is there anyone living in that house?
Do you have a part-time job?
I think that Tom is still homesick.
We'd like a double room with bath.
I need to keep my hands clean.
Everybody is here.
I drink a glass of milk before I go to bed.
My youngest daughter goes to the same school as Tom.
I've been here for a week.
I'm not going to go in there.
Tom doesn't have to go to work today.
That's a flat-out lie.
You're wearing your sweater inside out.
Tom's friends are nice.
He gave me what money he had.
"You've already read this book, right?"
It rained three days on end.
The weather will be nice tomorrow.
"If you do something that crazy, you'll be laughed at."
I dove into the river.
Tom finally got a job.
Tom fell off his bicycle and injured himself.
The atomic number of iron is 26.
I have a headache.
What he said was over my head.
My neighbor is nice.
Air the futon.
This is a picture of the airport.
I told you guys to go home. Why are you still here?
I'd like to go cycling.
This is the first time that I've ridden a horse.
Maybe someday you'll understand that.
Merry Christmas!
I don't know the right answer.
Everybody knows that Tom can speak French well.
Tom was standing right behind Mary.
My sister works in a bank as a secretary.
Tom is a good reader.
The book is easy.
I don't want you to talk to Tom.
Do you have any further questions?
It's awesome.
Tom repeated the question.
There's one thing I'd like to know.
My car broke down on the way.
May I request a favour of you?
That was actually really fun.
How far is it to the nearest hospital?
I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth.
They relaxed.
Mary is wearing a colorful kimono.
The red and white flag fluttered in the wind.
"Having finished it, he went to bed."
We've missed our bus.
I'm going to get changed.
I have a couple questions.
I have a slight headache now.
I love that author's books.
Please turn the light on.
Tom is three years old now.
Perhaps I could come back tomorrow.
What's your occupation?
My favorite instrument is the harmonica.
I like pie.
Did you say something?
This book is small.
The bed I slept in last night wasn't very comfortable.
Roses have a nice fragrance.
Could you pass the salt?
Get down!
I regret having done it.
I hear you have a new girlfriend.
I know how old you are.
I couldn't believe my eyes.
"Unless I'm mistaken, I've seen that woman before."
I'm dying for a cold drink.
I live with my uncle.
Broken glass lay scattered all over the road.
I'm a member of the glee club.
I like spring better than fall.
Did you see Tom hug Mary?
That's too bad.
"All of us, except him, went."
He has a strong sense of responsibility.
Don't let go of the rope until I tell you.
Mary says she's OK.
I'm very thirsty.
She comes from a good family.
That's no way to talk to your teacher.
Why are we running?
You need to see a doctor.
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
I want to improve my penmanship.
I'm going to a concert.
That baby carriage is ours.
"If you don't like doing that, it's OK to stop doing it."
I burned the letter.
You're in a good mood this morning.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for so long.
Tom and Mary found what they were looking for on the top shelf.
I'd rather not.
We could hear the bells ringing from a nearby church.
It's fairly warm today.
Tom is very mean to me.
Did you like Boston?
My uncle has been dead for three years.
Don't be sad.
I promise that I won't do that.
I hate making mistakes.
Take care of yourself.
That was a close call.
I'll probably be late.
I think I'll go skiing.
The committee consists of fifteen people.
I still have a lot of work to do.
She is a beauty.
The wind feels great today.
The car crashed into the guard-rail and rolled down the hill.
One page is missing.
Are you still going to wait for Tom?
Tom is having lunch with the police chief.
Is this a hoax?
I bookmarked the page.
I entirely approve of what you say.
Send the kids to bed.
Mary won't listen to her friend's advice.
What did you have to eat?
Tom is very good at playing the violin.
I'm a photographer.
You're smart.
Is Tom right?
No one will bother to do such a thing.
"As soon as he comes back, let me know."
I like watching TV.
He's got money to burn.
Watch TV here.
She began to sing.
It was real hard work.
That's the part I liked best.
Tom groaned in his sleep.
Admission is free for preschool children.
What're you referring to?
They escaped.
The shipment has reached us safely.
Do what feels right to you.
The blood was a dark color.
I bought two pairs of trousers.
He asked for a beer.
I play in a band.
"At school, we're taught reading, writing and arithmetic."
This is making me really angry.
My sunburn hurts.
I'm keeping a secret.
Little did I think there would be a typhoon.
Please leave a message on my answering machine.
Sorry for being late.
"If you can't lick 'em, join 'em."
Let's move this.
I wanted to go back to your village.
Swimming in the ocean is fun.
Are you bored?
The girl and her parents were very sympathetic.
There's no need to go to school today.
Eat everything.
Sugar replaced honey as a sweetener.
Tom was friendly to me.
I like dogs better than cats.
I always hated this place.
Why are you so sad?
I'm a bit busy.
I've never seen anybody do that before.
The number of people who prefer to marry late is gradually rising.
There's no place like home.
"Me, too."
Six months ago I had an operation for the cataract in my right eye.
Tom was kissing Mary when I walked into the classroom.
The truth is that I don't know anything about it.
I'm glad Tom passed the exam.
The doors will close.
I bought an umbrella.
I wonder whether it'll rain tomorrow.
I met him by chance on the train this morning.
The train was on the point of leaving when I got to the station.
Let's ask him.
That belongs to us.
You learn more from trying to repair a TV than from watching one.
I gave my mother a birthday present.
Tom and Mary got married about three years ago.
Please feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge.
Tom is crazy about Mary.
He made heaps of money by ripping off naive suckers.
Can he speak English?
I've always wanted to ride a horse.
Has Tom broken something again?
I like Tom more than you.
Tom is absent.
This is too spicy.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be hiding?
I have three computers.
"At the end of every day, his back was tired and his legs hurt."
I hope to see you again before long.
I've been on my own these past few months.
"That is a large force with 5,000 soldiers."
Is that near here?
What did Tom say about me?
Was Tom handcuffed?
May I have a sip of your coffee?
I might not be able to do that alone.
She took the tablecloths to the laundry.
He hardly ever works.
You don't have to be scared.
I can't feel at home in a hotel.
We stopped over in Los Angeles for two nights on the way to New Zealand.
Are you going to eat that cupcake?
I've been living here for these ten years.
This course teaches basic skills in first aid.
I want to eat ice cream.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary in French.
"Tom is asleep in bed, isn't he?"
We should provide for unexpected events.
It's not such a big problem. You're worrying way too much.
He devoted his life to education.
There is no use crying over spilt milk.
"If Tom had been wearing a helmet, he wouldn't have been injured so badly."
I can't understand this sign's meaning.
"A long time ago, there was a bridge here."
Did Tom understand it?
She is looking for a job where she can make use of her foreign language ability.
"Tom is left-handed, but he writes with his right hand."
I think we should lower the price.
I can't feel my toes.
Please pass this note around.
This makes no sense.
Tom and Mary have decided to get divorced.
Tom is our youngest son.
Is it sunny outside?
We weren't at home yesterday.
He found it difficult to make himself understood in German.
Would you like some tea?
I prefer coffee to tea.
I want to become a journalist.
Tom turned off the television.
Stay quiet and rest.
Where's the restroom?
Tom was still alive.
Tom is a math nerd.
"Fill out this form, please."
We're thinking about buying a new house.
I want to change the world.
Please let me take a day off tomorrow.
He is a fast runner.
This is your responsibility. It's not the kind of thing you can laugh off.
Tell me about your son.
"My leg's gone to sleep, so I don't think I can stand up right away."
"Tom got in trouble, didn't he?"
Let's start jogging together from tomorrow morning.
Would you like some of those pictures?
It's too dark to play outside.
I'm going to have to pass on that.
What did you think of that book?
Is Mary a pretty girl?
I'm not in pain.
I wish to visit Egypt someday.
We have a good opinion of your invention.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
I'm glad you've returned safely.
Are there wolves in Australia?
You'll have to try a bit harder next time.
"The peace talks failed again, with both sides blaming the other for the failure."
The admission is ten dollars a person.
My watch was stolen last night.
Bring that over here.
It's Monday today.
I need a pencil. Can you lend me yours?
There is a pen on the desk.
"If you're sleepy, you should go to bed."
Tom was one of my first students.
That guy annoys me.
Is there somewhere I can lie down?
"In case of fire, call 119."
"Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, and is the second biggest city in Spain."
There aren't many books on these shelves.
I'll come as often as possible.
"We tried it again, but couldn't do it."
He accommodated me with a night's lodging.
What are you hiding behind your back?
You won't regret it.
It makes no difference to me whether you kiss Tom or not.
He looks like he's drunk.
We were surprised at the news.
Dinner is ready.
The twins are so much alike that I cannot distinguish one from the other.
Please stop the car.
Man is the only animal that can use fire.
I can't for the life of me remember her address.
Do it at your own pace.
The rain lasted a week.
Do you play tennis?
He is not as intelligent as his older brother.
I believe Tom can get home by himself.
What're you getting at?
Is Tom nervous?
This area has completely changed.
I hope that Tom gets well soon.
The computer has a virus.
She isn't afraid of snakes.
Why don't you go upstairs and lie down for a while?
He'll come soon.
I can't shake off my cold.
I'm sure that's no fault of yours.
Have you eaten dinner?
They live near the school.
Are you sure this is Tom's suitcase?
Tom asked me who the man standing in front of the statue was.
Can you help look after the kids?
I have caught a cold.
That's not true.
I shouldn't have drunk so much wine.
"Oh, I'm terribly sorry."
She gave me a necktie which was completely to my liking.
There's no membership fee for joining.
Tom has a white cat.
I didn't know that you went to law school.
"Just a moment, please."
Would you care for another glass of beer?
My eyes are burning.
Where's the remote control for the TV?
Which is the most delicious?
It's raining again.
This doesn't fit.
I'm never late for school.
Most car accidents happen because drivers aren't paying attention.
He held his breath.
Mary is a dish.
Please wait for me at the station.
When was the last time you ate pizza?
It's our turn.
I'm kidding.
I want something to read.
We may meet again in the near future.
We still have a lot of food left.
Tom wants to become a French teacher.
Don't forget to turn off the gas before you leave the house.
"If I take the 2:30 train, when will I arrive in Boston?"
Don't make me laugh!
Tom will definitely be here tomorrow.
How dare you say that!
Spring is just around the corner.
I began playing golf years ago.
I saw Tom in there.
I'm really good at figuring out problems like this.
I'm engaged in a new business.
Thanks for the info.
I found this movie very interesting.
Tom is a little kid.
He's sitting in the waiting room.
How long did it take you to get to Boston?
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.
Tom shot the bear.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
"I'm at work now, so I'll call you later."
You'd better have breakfast.
I have to finish this job by tomorrow.
Are you going to go to Tokyo tomorrow?
I'll lend you this book.
Do you like trips?
I'm not interested in chess.
I just want to crawl into a hole and die.
I can't find my suitcase.
She was beautiful in her time.
I don't want to work here anymore.
Shame on you!
How you've grown!
Many of the buildings were destroyed in World War II.
What are you getting at?
He may not want to see her.
I didn't want you to know.
I cycle to work.
What're you waiting for?
Tom is too old to go trick-or-treating.
The lake is four miles across.
How long did it take to get to Boston?
The shop sells expensive accessories for women.
Do you think Tom knows I want to go to Boston?
She lost her new watch.
What on earth did you put it on the menu for?
I had to pay another five dollars.
I bought a present for Tom.
Jump!
I know that Tom is your friend.
She has spent hours at the gym trying to lose weight.
She is neatly dressed.
We finally decided to give him over to the police.
This is Tom's cup.
Are you still angry with me?
"No matter what the cost, I'll accomplish that."
Knead the dough.
I'm available now.
Please take another one.
What exactly did Tom say?
I am interested in music.
He spent his sixtieth birthday in the hospital.
You should've phoned.
Tom did really well.
You're going to be famous someday.
It was worth it.
Tom ate the last one.
I have a request.
Let's have sushi.
This is all the money I have right now.
The volcano has become active again.
This fruit can be eaten.
We were dead tired from the five-hour trip.
I fixed it.
"To me, it's important."
When did you start working here?
I really do love it.
I found this restaurant by accident.
I skipped breakfast.
I've just come home.
Do you know what this car cost?
I didn't recognize him at first on the train.
I have to buy dog ​​food.
I thought you might be able to give me a hand.
Mary joined the army when she was eighteen.
I'm not going to tell you what to do.
"As is often the case with him, he didn't show up on time."
"Excuse me, please check the oil."
Tom answered in detail.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
You know where the problem lies.
He told me that he likes you a lot.
The girl who lives next door is very pretty.
Let Tom know that I'll be late.
I ordered two teas and three coffees.
I'm afraid something is wrong with my watch.
Please replace it.
Please take a seat and be quiet.
He lacks experience.
What year were you born?
Let's get the show on the road.
What do you think of that new restaurant?
I'm thirty years old.
Is it true Tom doesn't know any French?
The company incurred a deficit of $400 million during the first quarter.
The temperature is going up.
Please send an ambulance.
My business has at last gotten on the right track.
Where did the accident take place?
How are we going to do that?
Tom's father was an alcoholic.
Stop bad-mouthing him.
Stand in line.
"Hey, your dog just bit me."
It's quite different.
How long have you been learning English?
Tom has filed for bankruptcy.
"You will keep your word, won't you?"
Sit on the bench.
I agree to your proposal.
Today is Tom's thirtieth birthday.
A closed fist can indicate stress.
He bored us with his long stories.
"I'm sorry, I can't stay long."
You're disgusting.
It's now or never.
I often watch night games on TV.
You can't be serious.
Your composition has a few mistakes.
This box is empty. It has nothing in it.
My daughter is getting married in June.
"No, thank you. I'm just looking around."
"If there's anything at all that you don't understand, you can ask me anytime."
I hope nothing happens to Tom.
Wait one minute.
I shouldn't have said that.
She was in the United States last month.
Who's that man?
Goodbye.
She was injured in a car accident.
Do you have rice?
You should be careful when you drive a car.
Are you listening to English?
He told a funny story.
Fallen rocks cut off the only access to the village.
I'm looking forward to your visit.
Privacy doesn't exist.
There was nobody in the garden.
"Hey, is everything all right?"
I didn't know that Tom had three children.
Tom has fallen for Mary's trap.
I don't need a tissue.
Everything is all right.
"The nights are cool, but the days are hot."
She closely resembles her mother.
"If you'd been a little more patient, you would've succeeded."
I've been reflecting on what you said to me.
It never occurred to me that he might be an escaped prisoner.
Your salary is based on commissions.
How long have you been waiting for Tom?
"If it's raining tomorrow, I'll stay home."
I took Highway 58.
Why is French so difficult?
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
My kid brother is twelve.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back tomorrow.
More often than not I lay awake all night.
I've just been to the post office to send a package.
I'm not a boy anymore.
He has quite a few valuable paintings.
Tom committed suicide yesterday.
The hotel I'm staying at is near the station.
Could you open the curtains?
I work for McDonald's.
Tom was totally snockered before the party even began.
We had to wait three hours.
Women usually live 10 years longer than men do.
I'll make dinner tonight.
Don't open your book.
Whose pencil is this?
I had an asthma attack.
They just had a healthy baby boy.
I like butter better than cheese.
She assumed an air of indifference.
My front tooth fell out.
May I use this pen?
The boys are playing football right now.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in your cap and gown.
This beer contains 5% alcohol.
I don't feel up to running to the station.
I'd prefer not to go swimming today.
The whole neighborhood was surprised at the news.
This book is really interesting.
The couple posed for the photograph.
Are you still open?
I gave him a book.
Wait a few more days.
Please let me know.
Are you listening?
I'm not able to lift this stone.
"Tom is my friend now, but we didn't like each other at first."
Tom doesn't like talking about politics.
The soldiers are exhausted.
I wonder whether or not it'll rain tomorrow.
He added that he didn't believe it.
I'm the only one here that doesn't know French.
Don't let that dog go.
Tom retires next spring.
Where are you going dressed up like that?
Praising children is an important thing.
I heard that he'd died.
Whose pen is this?
I watch television.
You should stay in the hospital for treatment.
I was leaving home when Tom telephoned me.
I think it's wrong to tell a lie.
I can teach French.
Tom is making stew.
I teach French in Boston.
I'll gladly come.
I want to eat fried rice.
I like the smell of pizza.
I have nothing to do today.
Have you ever been mugged?
Fashion in the eighteenth century emphasized the bosom.
The situation is horrible.
Speaking English isn't easy.
Is this Tom's house?
I don't know why Tom doesn't like me.
That's none of your business.
I entered the restaurant and had lunch.
I don't care what people think about the way I dress.
Please tell Tom I'll be a few minutes late.
I kissed Tom.
Someone's still in the shower.
"After the lightning, came the thunder."
She made me hurry.
Tom will be staying with us for a few days.
He became irritated.
Take good care of yourself.
"The first time I drank beer, I didn't like it."
Yesterday's test was very difficult.
The defendant was granted an appeal.
Tom likes to fish.
Why are you blaming me for what happened?
Tom will likely be absent tomorrow.
Not everyone can be a poet.
I hope I pass the test.
"It's your own money, right?"
The cake was crawling with ants.
"Come downstairs, Tom."
I think that it'll be easy to do the job.
She sang a Japanese song for us.
The wall was covered with graffiti.
I slept twelve hours yesterday.
I thought that it went OK.
My nose is so itchy.
Tom ordered orange juice.
Keep back.
I have three mobile phones.
Let's sell it.
Peaches taste sweet.
How did you meet?
You shouldn't let children play with the kitchen knife.
I wonder whether life exists on other planets.
I thought that it was a great idea.
I'll give you a check-up.
He promised me to come by five at the latest.
The end does not always justify the means.
I called him a coward to his face.
What do you think of Tom?
He's a party animal.
There were few students remaining in the classroom.
I want Tom to tell me the truth.
The sun is rising.
You'll have to ask at the newsstand.
You have only to push this red button.
Is it large enough?
It's perfect.
"I'm sorry, but I can't answer right away."
It's up to you whether you study or not.
Tom's book was translated into French.
Tom kissed Mary's cheek.
You hurt Tom pretty bad.
I didn't ask Tom why he wanted this.
He took a short cut.
She majors in child psychology.
Don't rush me.
This is the third longest river in the world.
Everyone was very happy.
He had a hasty breakfast.
It's too early to go to bed.
I hope Tom isn't frustrated.
He lives in Tokyo.
"Be sure to telephone by Friday, OK?"
I bought it at a department store.
It began to snow heavily as I got off the train.
My piggy bank is almost full.
The murderer is still at large.
Everything is fine. Don't worry.
You should be careful about your health.
I could make nothing of what he said.
Sometimes my hands shake.
Tom was unfriendly.
The taxi has arrived.
"You're in trouble, aren't you?"
I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
The first one wasn't the best one.
He is not altogether wrong.
Tom's my friend.
Do you have earphones?
Please say the alphabet in reverse.
This curry is too hot to eat.
Did you make a reservation?
Is it going to snow?
Do you use bath salts?
We'll begin work soon.
Mary helped her mother cook.
Nothing really happened.
"Once more, please."
I thought Tom was going to kiss me.
He has been studying for two hours.
Do you want to be a father?
I always feel sleepy.
I see a house among the trees.
I make it a rule to brush my teeth before I go to bed.
Can you come and help me zip up my dress?
Kids like snow.
I'll never do this again.
Australia is a hard place for me to live.
We live in that apartment just over the street.
Would you mind if I turned off the radio?
The horse would not move.
Tom can speak German as well as English.
Why am I still alive?
He was too old to swim.
Could you please say that again?
This ink is the best.
Tom arrived three days ago.
Why didn't you tell me you could speak French?
He tried getting closer to her using every possible means.
He married my sister.
"Frankly, I don't like him."
It's like magic.
I wish to say a word of apology.
It's a common symptom.
Mary said that she was going to Boston.
What was your grandfather's name?
The figs in the bag haven't been washed yet.
"Of course, it's a joke."
Is your baby sleeping?
I'd like you to pay the money in advance.
It sounds like you had a good time.
Is that answer right?
I have never eaten a mango before.
Grandma is three and a half times your age.
"Excuse me, are you a student?"
He sent the letter back unopened.
"Which is larger, Japan or England?"
They are my sisters.
Can I use my laptop in the bath?
The motor stopped.
I really tried.
You'd better hurry up if you want to get home before dark.
That's too bad.
I don't think an exception should be made.
I don't care what happens.
What made you sad?
Please show me a cheaper one.
He wanted to come with us.
Doing that will take too much time.
I was surprised that Tom spoke French so well.
"It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?"
I don't mind.
Don't say such stupid things.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
My heart beat faster.
Feed the dog.
I'm uncomfortable in these new shoes.
Rabbits have long ears.
"Bring me a cup of coffee, will you?"
What's the difference between jam and marmalade?
I didn't realize I had my shirt on inside out.
He was covered with sweat.
I feel sort of dizzy and I feel like throwing up.
Hang on!
It will not be long before he comes.
It's about time we bought a new microwave oven.
"Does he like music? ""Yes, he does."""
I just wanted to see him.
You're thinking too much.
I think it'll take more than a year to finish building our house.
Tom only thinks about making money.
I don't want to get involved in that business.
He did not put up his hand.
Two weeks went by.
Tom has many friends living in Boston.
Are you already drunk?
"Since there was no bus, I had to walk."
Is Tom sleeping?
"In order to do that, you have to take risks."
This book is too hard for me.
The lawyer decided to appeal the case.
I prefer rice to bread.
We waited for three hours.
Whose umbrella is this?
"With those results, you won't be able to go to university."
Tom said he'd never water skied.
I don't go to the gym.
Today is your birthday.
Did you understand the question?
I couldn't go out because of the rain.
The house was struck by lightning yesterday.
"Speak louder, please."
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You ought to see a doctor.
Tom locked his sister in the closet.
I usually go on foot.
Aren't you spending Thanksgiving with Tom?
It failed.
Please take this away.
I think my girlfriend is kind of cute.
The only person that I trust here is Tom.
You should give up smoking since it's unhealthy.
He doesn't understand you.
I'm sending you a picture of my family.
Natto is sticky.
There are a lot of legends in Japan.
A crowd gathered at the scene.
I've read all of those books.
Don't ask me such difficult questions.
What a pity!
My mother and father were both born in Boston.
This translation is wrong.
Get away!
You could've told me earlier.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss your train."
What are you majoring in?
Let me carry it for you.
"A ""shiitake"" is a type of mushroom."
I won't give up on the stolen money.
Why are you looking at me like that?
"Thank you. ""You're welcome."""
She's gotten fat.
We're going to the hospital.
No mountain in Japan is higher than Mt. Fuji.
Can you identify which coat is yours?
Tom will join our team.
I don't have as much money as I used to have.
She's concerned about your safety.
"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying."
Can I have your telephone number?
I think I'm going to throw up.
Can you use a computer?
Put out the fire.
Our dog was run over by a truck.
It is just out of the question for me to finish the work in a day.
I'll take a shower.
Don't ask me why.
No one can predict what'll happen.
Don't tell Tom anything.
This egg is cracked.
She is good at playing tennis.
I've eaten enough.
"Cities are exciting places, but also stressful."
There is a hole in his sock.
It is getting dark. Let's go home.
"Sorry, I've got to go."
Would you like some more bread?
Get out of here.
They are arguing about their share of the property.
Could you please speak a little more slowly?
That river floods every year.
I played tennis.
Are you the one who wrote that report?
Play some Chopin.
I usually go home at five.
Tom read somewhere that short people need more sleep than tall people.
Smoking is bad for your health.
I ran as fast as I was able to.
Yelling about it won't help now. You should have done that when it counted.
Where did Tom learn to dance like that?
It's within walking distance.
He came to Tokyo at the age of three.
This house has a thatched roof.
I have nothing to do this afternoon.
"I had something to do, so I couldn't go home right away."
When's the next meeting? I hope it's not on Monday.
I don't belong to any club.
Tom doesn't like drinking.
I can't believe that three years has already gone by.
Please open your bag.
I know that Tom is a really bad driver.
Do you think that it'll rain tomorrow?
Please tell me the correct time.
"Close the door, please."
Forgive Tom.
I have lived here for a long time.
I want somebody to talk with.
I'd shut up if I were you.
He took back everything he said.
Tom put away his clothes.
I only had one Canadian boyfriend.
Do you have a vision of your future?
This is what we want to know.
I could've tried harder to get along with everyone in the class.
I want to become both physically and mentally stronger.
Get me the key.
Please don't tell Tom anything.
The movie we watched last night was really scary.
Did Tom say anything about that to you?
He skis in Hokkaido every winter.
I'm different from my father.
Are you going to walk home?
I wonder if Tom is free now.
She acknowledged having made a mistake.
My father will be back at the beginning of next month.
I will answer within three days.
Mary didn't keep her promise.
I think what you're doing is right.
There are many earthquakes in Japan.
Your fly's open.
He is a childhood friend.
Keep it.
What's the name of your horse?
Don't lean against the wall.
"I have goldfish, too."
You should go to see a doctor.
I hate reading.
What on earth are you looking at?
She is accustomed to doing her homework before dinner.
We can see things in the distance using a telescope.
Please answer the phone.
Is it OK if I kiss your wife?
The police found evidence that the man committed the crime.
"You're in pain, aren't you?"
Is there any more beer?
"Is Tom a Canadian, too?"
She does nothing but complain.
I'm pretty good at cooking spaghetti.
Please give me a sheet of paper.
I want my own house.
What should I get Tom for his birthday?
He asked me to pass him the salt.
This house is not for sale.
He decided to marry her.
How would you translate this sentence into French?
Let's eat dessert.
"I saw a wolf, a fox, and a rabbit."
I was rather drunk.
We play chess every evening.
"Anyway, I'm glad you were able to broach this difficult subject."
He asked if I liked Chinese food.
I avoid reading the news.
He picked up the book.
Tom has a small peach tree in his backyard.
"When I came back, my car was gone."
They are a good couple.
The train departed on time.
"I don't have a license, so I can't drive."
When do we eat?
I didn't mean to hurt Tom.
He's likely to come.
The lake is deepest at this point.
What if the unthinkable should happen?
We don't have a lot of food.
There were no students who went to the party.
I often went fishing with him.
You've got bags under your eyes.
Your book is here.
I was surprised as well.
Can I see a menu?
What I hate is looking for work.
We believe in God.
I didn't like beer the first time I tried it.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Come and see me once in a while.
Don't talk to Tom about this.
Which shall I begin with?
Please come back in thirty minutes to get it.
I usually got up at five in those days.
It's gradually getting colder.
We could continue.
This desk is a bit too low for me.
I'd rather die than give up.
The end justifies the means.
Leave the books as they are.
This is the first time I've smoked.
Hand me that bag.
I was embarrassed by that.
"You're a busy man, so I'll adjust my schedule to yours."
I get nervous when I speak before a large audience.
I need Tom now.
I forgot to bring my I.D. card.
I'm not a bit tired.
Are you sure that guy's name is Tom?
Please pick me up at the airport at five.
I can't stand that noise.
I'll call you in a couple of days.
I'll take care of your kitten while you're gone.
He wore a mask so that no one could recognize him.
Which subject do you like best?
Tom set the table.
I thought that it was a good idea.
I presented my ticket at the door.
Be a good listener.
It's not cold in the house.
Tom took off his mask.
I would like to borrow fifty dollars from you.
The morning sun came in the window.
I was just in time for the last train.
I'm fine.
"Let's eat, drink, and be merry."
This is very important.
"Tom told me that Mary was good at playing the piano, but I didn't really believe him until I heard her play."
Cats don't like getting wet.
Can I borrow your ladder?
We have been married for three years.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Tom won't return my calls.
This has been a long week.
Don't be rash.
"It looks easy, but it's pretty exhausting."
I'm trying to save room for dessert.
Tom arrived at the station at 3:00.
I can understand why you don't like Tom.
My headache is gone.
"Wonderful weather, isn't it?"
My father used to read to me at bedtime.
How can we kill time?
What class is Tom in?
Let's take a break.
Three men broke out of prison yesterday.
How did you come by all this money?
He has no chance of recovering.
Do you sell mineral water?
Why do rabbits have long ears?
They're eating apples now.
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.
I'm dying to see it.
She wrote in ink.
What's your younger brother's name?
What do you call this vegetable in English?
Tom promised.
I love fresh bread.
I think I spoke too quickly.
You are not a child anymore.
I usually go to school by bicycle.
Tom arrived three minutes early.
We grew up together.
He is a man of wisdom.
"If they were Canadians, this problem wouldn't exist."
Please help me.
That race was fixed.
Where's the toothpaste?
He works at a bank.
Tom leaned on Mary's shoulder.
Please drop in on us.
Did you do your homework by yourself?
Don't make me hurt you.
Please relax.
Tom is now three years old.
French is useful.
I was up all night studying.
"May I call you tonight? ""Sure."""
"After an absence of ten months, he returned home."
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
Please have some cookies.
Tom got hit by a stray bullet.
Tom likes country music.
He isn't lonely anymore.
The train will come in at platform ten.
"Generally speaking, the climate of Japan is mild."
Where's the cafeteria?
I think I've met you before.
It's hard for me to go down stairs.
"Well, I have to be going."
Tom and Mary are very comfortable together.
She accused me of being a liar.
Try harder.
May I speak to you a minute?
I often play tennis after school.
You always try to blame somebody else.
I'm sure the children are getting big.
I was absorbed in reading a novel.
Tom is poor.
Would the two of you quit bickering?
I was deceived by Tom.
Can I change the route?
Tom isn't good with basic arithmetic.
There is a doll in the box.
"Hurry up, or you'll be late."
The house was in flames.
He didn't turn up after all.
Children who are sixteen years old or younger may not enter the theater.
It's nice and cool here.
There isn't any hope of his success.
I think it would be better not to take Tom to Boston with you.
We fixed the date for our class reunion.
Can I say one thing?
Put your uniform on.
I'll be late.
I don't like sad movies.
This coffee tastes bitter.
Tom likes disco music.
Have you eaten breakfast yet?
Is Tom good-looking?
"Hey, what are you talking about?"
I can't speak French or English.
I smell something burning.
I have something to give you.
I'll take back what I said.
Never swap horses while crossing a stream.
"That man is skinny, but his wife is fat."
Tom bought rolls.
I like both cats and dogs.
Anything is OK with me.
Don't read my diary.
"Having finished my work, I went home."
"Do you have a cell phone, Tom?"
His joy showed on his face.
Let's conserve our limited water supply.
How come you aren't taking me?
May I borrow your pen?
We went for a stroll.
The road is blocked.
I haven't gone to college yet.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I want you to do it at once.
Come at any time you like.
I'm glad that you found the money that you lost.
Where did you buy this car?
There's no mistake about it.
Thanks for yesterday.
He was absent from school because of illness.
"Tom, look at me when I'm speaking to you!"
It would be better if you went by train.
Are you hurt?
"We'll be able to raise cows and sheep, too."
We'll go on a picnic next Sunday.
Bring the washing in.
My wish has finally come true.
I'd be very grateful if you could help me.
"The more I think of it, the less I like it."
She has consented to take the leadership of the party.
The train seems to be late.
Please don't cry.
"Stay calm, and do your best."
What's the secret?
Do you think that will be useful?
Tom is a real man.
Do you wash your hands before meals?
I have no idea why he quit his job suddenly.
Would you like to come to my party?
This house belongs to my uncle.
Our money ran out.
Thank you for your assistance.
Did you put in any salt?
There are insects everywhere.
He has been in Japan for three years.
The hotel burned down.
This problem is a real challenge.
Tom is making a paper airplane.
Would you be so kind as to turn the light on?
I think that we'd better leave early.
The road was blocked by fallen rocks.
I forgot we had homework.
He is my classmate.
I think it is a mere coincidence.
Why are you laughing?
I thought you wanted Tom to marry you.
How many brothers do you have?
Apparently there's a cancellation charge of 30 percent.
Is that what Tom would really want?
I was late for the last train.
I've been laughing at that for over an hour now.
I'll make a phone call.
He can't tell right from wrong.
Does Tom have any brothers and sisters?
Our team won the game.
It was just 6 years ago that I visited New Zealand for the first time.
Give him an inch and he'll take a yard.
You couldn't live without water.
Will you help me with my homework?
What does that mean?
Would you mind if I joined you?
The house was quiet.
Can I get an advance on my salary?
I thought Tom might know where Mary lives.
The lake was frozen.
Tom isn't watching TV now.
I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
Where are you going?
Keep reading.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
"I'm, as you know, a very busy person."
The queen was gracious enough to invite us.
Smoking is not permitted here.
Is that car Tom's?
I broke the ashtray.
Rice is grown in rainy regions.
She ran away with the eggs.
We speak French.
This desk is broken.
I think it's true.
Do it Monday.
She assisted her mother in caring for the baby.
The girl was kind enough to show me the way to the museum.
The old man often looks back on his youth.
He didn't specify when he would return.
"Because some urgent business came up, he wasn't able to go to the concert."
"I'm interested in that, too."
His brother is more patient than he is.
What you spend time doing in your childhood affects the rest of your life.
Today is Saturday.
Bring in the laundry.
Where are you going to spend the summer holidays?
"How hungry are you, Tom?"
Tom has committed suicide.
She's dieting.
Come whenever you want to.
He often goes to Japan on business.
I am sending you a picture of my family.
It took me three days to clean the room.
His story must be true.
Is this your book?
I wonder what that strange sound is.
It seems less crowded during the week.
I was rude.
Was it interesting?
This book could be useful to you.
"I tried to cut my bangs myself, but I cut off too much."
Tom was waiting for Mary to come.
There's no air on the moon.
They've asked me to translate this book into French.
Tom is a magician.
Our turn is next.
I want to work at my own pace.
I wanted to play tag.
How old is this tree?
He is studying agriculture.
"For further information, see page 16."
The store closes at seven.
The reason Tom got sick was because he overate.
I could run much faster when I was young.
It's nice today.
It should be stressed that we are often influenced by advertising without being aware of it.
Will you help me for a minute?
What made her do that?
This steak is very juicy.
See you then.
I'll show you that I am right.
Tom was away from his desk.
Mary received many gifts for her birthday.
May I come again?
He is an expert at solving such problems.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
You shouldn't underestimate me.
She has been busy since yesterday.
Don't take it personally.
I don't read books.
This is the first time I've had seaweed.
No sooner had she opened the door than a cat ran out.
I'm in no mood for joking.
My father manages the store.
It doesn't matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice.
Slow but steady wins the race.
Why did you buy a flower?
The book costs 4 dollars.
She is a quiet woman.
She played a part in the women's lib movement.
I threw a stone at the bird.
I can't find my glasses.
Are you still playing golf?
I have a little money.
Why did you show that to Tom?
Have both of you already had lunch?
Is there anything else that you want to know?
She told me that she came all the way from Hokkaido to see her brother.
Tom filled the bathtub with warm water.
He was at home.
Tom has a crush on Mary.
He has access to the stored information.
"The other day, I bought a camera."
When did this pain start?
"If it rains, please call me."
"You're married, aren't you?"
I'll tell you why I don't like Tom.
Why is Tom being nice to me all of a sudden?
I can't eat chocolate.
"Many women pursue higher education and careers, thus delaying marriage and childbirth."
Tomorrow is a holiday.
I've got the keys.
They both are wearing hats.
I don't think you should talk to Tom that way.
I'd say yes if I were you.
I like my name.
They think that they're stronger than I am.
That's what I thought
"Is there anything you want to tell me, Tom?"
"I have no time for that, and besides, I don't have any money."
She didn't reply.
I love trying new things.
I didn't study at all.
Is he correct?
Thank you very much for coming to see me.
I lost my keys somewhere yesterday.
"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."
At least three customers come into our shop every day.
Am I really the only Canadian here?
The mouse moved.
Do your parents live nearby?
I'd just like to go home.
Are you ready to go?
Is that rule applicable to us foreigners?
Tom is making himself a sandwich.
He kept reading a book.
It's been ten years since my father died.
These cookies are fresh from the oven.
She ran for the door.
Some cookies are stored indefinitely on users' hard drives.
"Could you turn on the light, please?"
My brother is a veterinarian.
Your idea sounds like a good one.
School was exciting.
Tom kissed Mary on the forehead.
Where can I buy tickets?
Tom isn't Mary's grandson. He's her nephew.
Tom bought a used truck.
Is that your sister?
Could I have a slice of cheesecake?
He tried to speak French to us.
I corrected the translation.
The plum blossoms are at their best this week.
"Give me your attention, please."
He must have reached the station.
The old man was run over by a car.
You're very early this morning.
There seems to be something wrong with my clock.
The site gets more than 30 million visits a day.
There was a little milk left in the bottle.
The rain continued all day.
One plane after another took off.
I was too tired to stand.
Tom was surprised by Mary's comment.
"Being bored, the audience began to yawn."
That's right.
Have you ever eaten anything that Tom cooked?
Are you making fun of me?
Can I borrow your pen?
I can't afford to buy this car.
I do feel pretty good.
Let's sing.
You and he are both very kind.
Tell me how the robbery went down.
He talks as if he knew everything.
Tom arrived in Boston less than three weeks ago.
Tom couldn't look me straight in the face.
I am fond of reading.
"A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him round."
"Could I have some more soup, please?"
He soon betrayed his ignorance.
I bought a pendant to wear to the party.
We'll have lived here for two years next April.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
He came first.
My sister isn't studying now.
"As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that that's true."
This table is made of wood.
The gate is closed all the year round.
I'll see to it.
He was just on the verge of going to sleep.
Is it snowing in Boston?
It's nice to see you again.
My computer froze again.
The boy was full.
What the newspapers say is true.
"It's not all that spicy, so it's easy to eat."
I burned the roof of my mouth eating pizza.
I need some paper.
I'll give up smoking.
When will you bring back my umbrella?
I watched a movie.
I did it in a hurry.
Which do you want?
Why are you telling me this?
Sharks eat fish.
I live with my parents.
Is it too small?
Turn up the radio a little bit.
I haven't watched that video yet.
He likes this guitar.
I feel like going for a walk this morning.
Let's not deviate from the subject.
Where's the restroom?
He was eager to return to school in September.
"As the train pulled out, they waved goodbye to their parents."
Do you think Tom will play squash?
Tom has an innate talent.
Please speak in a low voice.
It's my money.
It's hard to predict what the weather will be like tomorrow.
They don't get along together.
Where are you guys going?
I wish I were as rich as you.
How are things with you and Tom?
This smells good.
My house is small and cramped.
The steak was very good.
Are you sure this is the right address?
I'd like to check out.
I'll give you anything that you want.
Who did you kill?
I'll pay you at the end of the month.
The teacher will illustrate how to do it.
I'm waiting for my turn.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I succeeded in my first attempt.
I don't know what this sentence means.
My older brother was ill-treated.
You don't have to worry about something like that.
The ages of the two children put together was equivalent to that of their father.
"In the fall, many birds head for the south."
Lunch is ready.
Tom and Mary discussed the problem for almost an hour.
He was sitting surrounded by the students.
She suggested to me that I call off the meeting.
Tom and I aren't married yet.
Did you turn off the stove?
Have a good time.
The tower can be seen from here.
What do you think of this poetry?
Don't leave me here alone.
Were you home yesterday?
I will come with you.
We will play soccer after school.
Tom asked me many things.
"In those days, the only thing I ate was junk food."
I was alone in the classroom.
He accepted her gift.
Does it hurt anywhere?
I have confidence in his abilities.
There's been a lot of rain this month.
The dispute was finally settled.
There's a teacher over there.
This is very cheap.
I hear from my mother every month.
I make it a rule not to watch television after nine o'clock.
What's in your refrigerator?
They live in that house among the trees.
Let's stay until the end of the game.
It's not your turn yet.
I like reading books.
You can't use this.
Tom is a fluent speaker of Japanese.
There are many women here.
There is a bank in front of the station.
It's dangerous to swim in this lake.
I will go along with you as far as the station.
It seems probable.
The water came up to my knees.
Are you still busy?
He likes to watch TV.
Does French have a similar expression?
A bus got in the way.
Would you pass me the salt?
Will you give me a ride?
It's difficult for me to express my thoughts in words.
That's your strong point.
We put off our departure because of the rain.
"When I lived in Boston, I often ate out."
I never drink at home.
I didn't say where I wanted to go.
Tom is used to traveling.
That's all.
Please answer yes or no.
He studies day and night.
Many large Japanese companies depend on exports.
"Strictly speaking, the tomato is a fruit."
"I used to have one, but it was stolen."
Tom bent down to tie his shoe.
He saw her and blushed.
I wonder if she'll recognize me after all these years.
It was such a cold day that there was nobody on the street.
Many Japanese get married in church.
Is this some kind of practical joke?
He is an active person.
Let's start with Lesson Ten.
My mother died when I was a kid.
It cost him 50 dollars to rent a car in Hawaii.
The restroom is on the right.
Doing that sort of thing makes you look stupid.
The golfer gave his caddy some medicine.
"May I use your dictionary? ""By all means."""
"Generally speaking, we Japanese are a little too timid in speaking foreign languages."
Could you please say that again?
I can hardly walk.
I left the restaurant disappointed.
I went to the airport to meet my father.
He cried out for help in a loud voice.
I forgot to buy a gift.
I'm going to visit Tom next week.
Tom is funnier than Mary.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
A true friend would not say such a thing.
It's snowing today.
He loses his temper quite easily.
I don't think that you should be doing that.
You'll be allowed to go out soon.
The driver accelerated his car.
Bring me some tissues.
Tom and Mary will have their 13th wedding anniversary soon.
She baked bread and cakes in the oven.
You're the owner.
It moved closer and closer.
How are you doing?
Take care not to catch a cold.
The enemy gave in without further resistance.
Have confidence. You can do it.
My uncle runs a hotel.
I think that it's unlikely Tom will get back in time for supper.
Is this radio yours?
Are you sure this is Tom's room?
The work progressed smoothly.
I promise I won't do that.
I came at about six.
Tom came to visit me recently.
I've been waiting for two hours.
He is the last man I want to see.
Several yachts were sailing side by side far out at sea.
Mind your own business.
"It's getting late, so we'd better get going."
I'd like to see Tom immediately.
He stopped for a smoke.
Tom's health is improving.
Watching soccer on TV is fun.
I hope he'll get better soon.
Would you please call him back later?
He is easygoing.
I really do like your ideas.
Tom is a lazy person.
Teach me how to do it.
Who do you think broke the window?
She is not very well off.
My car is in bad shape.
I have difficulty concentrating.
The temperature has been below zero for many days now.
There was scarcely any money left.
I'll try to eat it in one bite.
The soup is terribly hot.
I broke up with Tom.
This pond is shallow.
I'm extremely fat.
Have you ever tried doing that?
"Tom, are you and John brothers?"
He refused my offer for no good reason.
Tom is a handsome man.
We call New York the Big Apple.
Go away before they see you here.
I won't bother you.
We lined up for the bus.
It's an honor.
How long will you be gone?
I was ignorant of his plan.
"The moment the teacher left the classroom, it became quite noisy."
Fine feathers make fine birds.
I spent all morning cleaning my room.
I fell sound asleep because I was very tired.
He got wet from the waist to the knees.
Tom seems a little annoyed.
I'm not fond of her face.
The Oscar ceremonies are Hollywood's biggest extravaganza.
Did Tom say that he'd go to Australia?
I always catch colds in the winter.
Don't tell me what I can't do.
I finished my math assignment.
I like to draw pictures.
I broke the clutch.
"It's hot today, so you can swim in the ocean."
There'll be standing room only.
Make sure you get some sleep.
I don't think that we'll be able to solve this problem today.
"Will you have some more coffee? ""No, thanks. I've had enough."""
Where did you lose your umbrella?
Have you decided on a name for your baby?
I won't be quiet.
I had no idea of what she intended to do.
She's strong-willed.
Please leave right away.
There's a possibility that Tom is in the backyard.
You shouldn't wait here.
Have you lived here long?
We got an anonymous call.
Do you promise not to tell anybody?
We'll let you know the result within a week.
There's something in my eye.
All the names are listed in alphabetical order.
That's very hard.
Tom is very angry.
There are students in the library.
Is a meal served on this flight?
You can't use this washing machine.
I sat between Tom and John.
Give me a cup of coffee.
There are 30 students in my class.
The driver fell asleep at the wheel.
Tom is the tallest in his class.
She hit me on the head with a hammer.
How did you know that I liked Tom?
We complained about the poor service.
Don't you want to know what's happening?
How far is it from here?
Would you do me a favor?
He is used to traveling.
It is difficult for me to skate.
Tom brought me a slice of pie.
He knows New York inside out.
That was an excellent putt.
It's a very dangerous job.
Tom watched the squirrel jump from tree to tree.
Tom isn't as old as he looks.
I'm very busy these days.
Is Tom ready to go?
How many people do you know named Tom?
Where can I find toothpaste?
She's lost her car keys.
This software is free.
Return this book as soon as you can.
There were quite a few interesting things to see.
Tom got in his car.
You'll be hearing from me.
I feel fine.
Large amounts of money were spent on the new bridge.
This isn't cheating.
She is dear to me.
Everybody in the building felt the earthquake.
My arm still hurts.
He appears to be strong and healthy.
I'm willing to attend the meeting.
I'll wait here.
Did you just arrive?
It's unbearably hot today.
Where would you like to sit?
You've got something stuck in your teeth.
The students are making good progress in English.
The typhoon knocked down a tree in my yard.
Tom asked Mary for some money.
"Excuse me, but can you help me?"
I can't live without you.
I always thought Tom and Mary made a good couple.
Please take care of yourself.
Would you like to join us?
He is familiar with Japanese culture.
When will you be back?
"Tom isn't at home today, is he?"
Let me go!
Tom is a slacker.
We're looking forward to your visit.
It probably won't work.
I thought you were going to keep Tom here until I got back.
World War II ended in 1945.
Sales have recently increased.
Are you done?
It's likely to rain.
Tom has moved.
That will do.
He has been like a father to me.
Some gum stuck to his shoes.
I arrived yesterday.
It was not very cold yesterday.
They're green.
Why are dandelions considered weeds?
Please wait your turn.
Tom is going to be very angry.
My neighbor always mows his lawn on Sunday mornings.
This telephone is out of order.
I didn't go to school yesterday.
I took the cake out of the oven.
Tom is a volleyball player.
Were you surprised?
"Did you see squirrels? ""Yes, I did."""
Tom is an incredible athlete.
"A piano is expensive, but a car is more expensive."
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
I don't think that's a good idea.
It was a great success.
I am tired of hearing it.
"At first glance, everyone seemed happy."
I have a friend whose father is a teacher.
What time will you come to pick me up?
I'd like to dedicate this next song to the bride and groom.
I decided not to sign the contract.
I haven't checked yet.
There's nothing God can't do.
Tom unlocked the front gate.
It's a present for you.
Do you also cook?
She saw at a glance that her daughter had been crying.
Vegetarians don't eat meat.
Tom thinks it's impossible for Mary to break the record.
Tom turned the light off.
Why did Tom want to talk to me?
Don't run away.
Tom was raised by his grandparents.
All five rabbits were eaten by the hungry wolves.
You can smoke in this room.
I like the simplicity of her dress.
I'm poor at drawing.
I argued with him about it.
I want a picture of that dog.
Please accept our apologies for the trouble this matter has caused you.
He writes scripts.
I like to dance.
Which country are you from?
"Give me the bill, please."
She got to the hotel late at night.
I told him to come.
What time are you going to get up tomorrow?
I wonder whether there really is a Santa Claus.
He kept waiting for hours and hours.
Is seaweed good for you?
There's still a lot of work to do.
"To be honest, I'm afraid of Tom."
I think that my mom knows.
Put it on the floor.
I couldn't answer all of the questions.
Let me see.
"She deposits 10,000 yen in the bank every month."
"I think it's a fox, not a dog."
Is there an ATM close by?
I think it'll rain tomorrow.
Will Tom wait for us?
It is very cold today.
You don't need to know that.
It smells bad.
Boys can be trained to behave.
He is a real gentleman.
Thank you for your consideration.
You have to finish your homework right away.
I've baked a cake for Tom.
Tom is on the verge of crying.
Does anyone in your office speak French?
"If you find a mistake, please let me know right away."
They have lived in London for ten years.
He pretended to be sleeping.
Will you take me there?
It's no big thing.
I don't even like Tom.
He turned a deaf ear to their request.
I have truly learned many things from Tom.
The treatment prolonged the agony.
There were ten eggs in all.
I promise I'll be there tomorrow.
I saw something very unusual.
"According to the papers, the man has finally confessed."
The movie was so boring I fell asleep.
It will get warmer soon.
I can't see anything with the windshield all fogged up.
Tom's hands are bigger than mine.
Tom had a date for Valentine's Day.
It was hot inside the tent.

Tom speaks French as well as Mary.
He has many enemies in the political world.
I want to go abroad.
I think it's strange that no one is on the street this time of the day.
Here comes the train!
Such a custom should be done away with.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
My father likes pizza very much.
My decision to study abroad surprised my parents.
I will do it myself.
The soup is still hot.
"Would you like to go to a movie this weekend? ""I'm sorry I can't, but thanks for asking."""
It isn't healthy for you.
No one knows the future.
We have two sons.
I thought he would come alone.
Where can you get tickets?
You can't go in with this.
The police are out in force today.
"Tom can say ""I can only speak French"" in thirty languages."
It's really bright.
We saw only a few people.
I asked her for a date.
Christmas fell on Saturday that year.
I am familiar with your name.
He comes here twice a week.
I'm cold. May I close the window?
They abandoned their country.
I don't like baseball at all.
"Be quiet, please."
Classes end tomorrow morning.
The repair bill includes parts and labor.
I'd like to put some things in the hotel safe.
My sister-in-law had four children in five years.
I have a feeling that I've been here before.
My older brother had many German friends.
You can't buy it anymore.
Tom smiled.
I got a letter from a friend.
I'm going to get more exercise.
I'm very thirsty.
Who is that?
He accumulated his fortune by hard work.
I'm cool.
Can you tell me how to get to the station?
There's a large clock near the top of the tower.
Where is my soccer ball?
I'll help you.
The color white is a symbol of purity.
That's the fastest train in the world.
I'm afraid of cats.
Let's leave it at that.
You should find somebody else to help you.
She was absorbed in the video.
What made you come here?
Watch your step.
May I have another piece of cake?
I went to Disneyland yesterday.
I'm absolutely sure.
I'd never marry someone like that.
Tom is easily scared.
It was dark when we reached the hotel.
Tom packed a lunch for Mary to take to school.
I always eat out.
I'll explain it in detail next week.
How long do you plan to stay on this island?
I'll give it to Tom tomorrow.
Most of the children couldn't read or write.
How many books did you read last month?
You may leave the room now.
He carried six boxes at a time.
Is this mobile phone yours?
Tom hesitated.
Our living room is sunny.
I didn't cheat on the test.
Take as many cookies as you want.
Those trains run every three minutes.
Tom is at work.
I'd like to sleep a little longer.
"No matter how rich people are, they always want more."
How often do you go abroad?
I don't care what the consequences are.
The pilot described the scene in detail.
I've been working since I was sixteen years old.
Don't end up like Tom.
I converted my yen into dollars.
I really want you to believe me.
The details of the plan unfolded.
I have spots coming out all over my face.
What are your plans for today?
Let the game begin.
This was a good book.
How much do you weigh?
He was injured in the accident.
"It's important, so I'll do it."
Call me if you need my help.
I saw a beautiful bird.
Does Tom also speak French?
Do you have a library card?
I got up late this morning.
They gave up their plan to climb Mt. Fuji.
I want to eat a delicious cookie.
He is hated by everyone.
I know how you feel.
Chicken pox is a common childhood disease.
The party's over.
There's an easier way to do it.
I'm a bank employee.
I think about you every time I hear this song.
Switzerland is a beautiful country.
Let's play hookey and go see that movie.
We're better.
I asked my son what he really wanted.
Were you at home?
She was at a loss what to do next.
Are you sure that it was Tom who did that?
Don't you like wine?
They're watching a movie.
Not many people like Tom.
Here's my email address.
We bought a house.
He abandoned his family and went to live in Tahiti.
Fish live in the sea.
I want to live a relaxed life in the country after I retire.
Tom has left Boston.

She kept her eyes closed.
That's a beautiful necklace.
I'll be fine.

He got a loan from the bank.
I recommend it strongly.
How high is the mountain?
I love to take pictures.
Please keep this private.
He saw a butterfly on the wall.
All thirty people on board died.
Tom is wearing shorts.
How long will it take to finish the work?
Let's open a window to get some fresh air.
He insisted.
I hate tests.
I'm the one who met him.
Both of my parents are doctors.
Tom knows Mary doesn't know the answer.
Please tell me which bus to take to go downtown.
He could speak French.
Even I don't understand why I like Tom this much.
Put it back where you got it from.
It's wrong to tell lies.
This puzzle is too difficult for me.
I woke up very early this morning.
Shame on you!
I thought you'd be mad.
"While he was sick, he lost a lot of weight."
Tom doesn't drink vodka.
I'd like to be a teacher.
Turn the knob and open the door.
I come from Japan.
I'm a police officer.
They think Tom followed Mary home and killed her.
Help Tom and me.
She agreed with him about the holiday plan.
My parents also have a farm.
How about some coffee?
Here is your change.
Tom longs to live in the country.
He is alert to every chance of making money.
The boy put his hands in his pockets.
Thank you very much for the useful advice.
Tom forgot to remove the price tag.
I'll be back at ten.
Guide dogs help blind people.
Come on! We'll be late.
Don't exert yourself.
Don't disappoint me.
The countdown has begun.
Tom lives nearby.
Here's some deodorant.
What are you going to do after you leave school?
Exactly how many times did you do that?
I went there the day before yesterday.
The dry spell continued into September.
This is the end of my story.
Please stay here till I get back.
It was just a dumb mistake.
Give it to him.
"I'm to blame, not you."
The news made her very sad.
We discussed our plans for the future.
Everything is going well with our plan.
Did you finish the job?
Do you think I'm stupid?
I don't like the smell of durian.
Are you sure you don't know what it was?
"If you're not there by 2:30, we'll leave without you."
The judge decided against the plaintiff.
There's no cure for stupidity.
His ID was fake.
Did the interview go well?
Tom doesn't ever want to see Mary again.
I can sleep on the floor.
Mary is going to have a baby next month.
I am taller.
Tom isn't good at reading between the lines.
We must put safety before anything else.
Please give me medicine for motion sickness.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
He acquired the habit of snacking.
You can have it for nothing.
How many days are there in a week?
Her face turned pale.
That's a stupid question.
Stop copying me.
Is the job too much for you?
Tom is careless and often makes mistakes.
We've known that for a long time.
Tom sliced the onion.
Tom isn't interested in sports.
My dad would like to meet you.
He is able to speak ten languages.
The day before yesterday was very cold.

You should read this.
I just wanted to know what time Tom would arrive.
She's my classmate.
I lived in Boston for three years before moving to Chicago.
Have you read this?

He was tired then.

She was made to wait for over an hour.
My mother is preparing breakfast.
The heavy snow prevented me from going out.
He can read well enough.
Tom is here about three hours every day.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
"Never mind, I can do it by myself."
Can I help you?
"When I awoke, it was snowing."
I've had a similar experience.
What do you say to waiting five more minutes?
"I am going to my room, where I can study."
Work while you work; play while you play.
He is foolish.
He reluctantly agreed to my proposal.
Excuse me for interrupting you.
Tom and Mary are sincere.
He admired my new car.
I heard the howl of a wolf.
"On February 14th, Americans celebrate Valentine's Day."
"Taking out a knife, he tried to open the can."
I don't want to do the dishes.
Which car did Tom buy?
We really thank you for your patronage.
You're imagining things.
Black cloth absorbs light.
I've never heard him complaining about his meals.
I want to do that today.
I want to see my friends in Canada.
"You remember what happened, right?"
Why don't you get yourself a decent house?
My dad loves my mom.
Both Tom and I started laughing.
She's insatiable.
Is everything ready?
Tom has bought a new car.
"Speak more slowly, please."
My grandfather on my mother's side passed away ten years ago.
What was Tom laughing at?
The street is full of cars.
Four times two equals eight.
The French president is scheduled to visit Japan next month.
"You're imagining things, Tom."
I couldn't sleep because of the heat.
That wasn't what I intended.
You've overdone it.
Please speak a little more slowly.
I know all your secrets.
How old will you be next year?
Take care.
Darkness is falling.
The candle went out by itself.

I'm getting undressed.
My major is linguistics.
Do you have an English menu?
I wish that I could give you something.
You talk a lot.
May I leave now?
They think that Tom followed Mary home and killed her.
You two are ridiculously silly.
How many days were you in the hospital?
I fell in love with a married man.

We know that that isn't true.
I'm afraid of the dark.
We came to see the Fourth of July fireworks show.

He doesn't always come late.
The poor old woman had her bag stolen again.
We were caught in a snowstorm.
Wow! It's been a long time.
Does Tom like cats?
What are some good ways to catch mice?
Read the meter.
It was pouring rain.
You're nothing but a student.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
Didn't I tell you that you didn't need to worry about that?
"I spent my money on clothes, food and books."
I love rock music.
I didn't go with him.
Is someone knocking on the door?
He is the manager of a hotel.
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.
I didn't expect Tom to be so fluent in French.
There wasn't a single person in the park.
He doesn't tell lies.
Our native language is Japanese.
Would you like some tea or coffee?
The man standing in front of the hotel asked me if I needed a taxi.

She took a casual glance at the book.
This building is very large.
I refuse to answer that question.
Don't write in library books.
I'll try my best to be there by 2:30.
Don't be afraid.
Did you understand the moral of this story?
What's your horse's name?
Well begun is half done.
That girl can't ride a bicycle.
Will you turn on the TV?
Is your child a boy or a girl?
I get my hair cut once a month.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
It's at the back of the building.
I can understand why you don't like Tom.
"I hate mosquitoes, but they seem to love me."

This novel consists of three parts.
Tom didn't say anything.
Why do you speak French so well?

I wonder where Tom found these blackberries.
You're wrong about that.
The old men like to meet on the street corner just to shoot the bull.
I have a brother.
He's always anxious to pick up gossip.
I had my pen stolen.
There are too many people there.
There are wheels within wheels.
Is this spinach?
I hate it when this happens.
I thought Tom lived here.
I met him by chance.
It isn't my fault.
I think he's an honest man.
Why did he ask for so much money?
This lily smells really nice.
Tom interrupted our conversation.
I wonder if Tom can speak French.
He passed the examination.
This is a little difficult for me to say.
This was in your drawer.
He's a very important person.
Tom likes to swim.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
Japan is now very different from what it was twenty years ago.

Days are getting shorter and shorter.
We have a visitor right now. Would you mind waiting for a while?
I'll visit Tom in Boston next week.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the room.
Why didn't you phone before coming?
"You're Canadian, aren't you?"
Take out your notebooks.
I was watching a soccer match.
Call me if you find it.
Are you going to write to Tom?
Please take care of yourselves.
The dinner is almost ready.
I asked Tom a couple of questions.
This is empty.
Tom is a scaredy-cat.
I usually have a glass of milk for breakfast.
Tom can't play chess.
There's no chance of winning.
Jump as high as you can.
This is not a joke.
I have serious problems.
How shall we deal with this problem?
He is the last man I want to see.
What do you say to taking a rest?
I usually drink green tea with dinner.
We almost had it.
Stop speaking French.

You seem to have lost sight of original objective.
The fireworks yesterday were so pretty.
Our plan is made.
We want to have a large family.
It is going to snow.
"Why don't you come, too?"
She invited us to her birthday party.
Don't you want to know why I didn't do that?
I'll get there before you will.
She will give birth in July.
Supper is ready.
I like to give gifts to my family and friends.
My new car gets much better mileage than the old one.
Will you go on a date with me?
Did you forget to talk to Tom this morning?
Why didn't you call me earlier?
Everyone standing was a man.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
Both Tom and I can speak French.
That fox must have killed the hen.
Air is a mixture of various gases.
Tom is still not back. Just where is he?
Of course!
Time flies when you're having fun.
Football is an old game.
The train left on time.
How many guests are there?
Tom sometimes oversleeps.
The rumor turned out to be false.
Don't you have anything smaller than that?
Isn't it hard?
I think it's sad to have no friends.
Where would you like to go?
Does Tom like spaghetti?
What is this animal called in Japanese?
It was raining on and off all night long.
Tom said he would stop smoking.
I feel very chilly.
Tom borrowed thirty bucks from Mary.
Am I right?
My son is being potty trained.
This is an edible mushroom.
May I ask you something?
Check back next week.
Fighting won't settle anything.
He is about my age.
This information is very important to us.
I can't understand that.
The girl threw her arms around her father's neck.
Where can I buy a magazine?
What did you make?
The old woman studied the visitor carefully.
I was puzzled about what to do next.
"The twelve months of the year are January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December."
Tom used to go out with Mary.
I don't like mint tea.
Tom likes French.
Mind your own business.
Do you have a soup bowl?
Tom and Mary are getting married next month.
She has a kind heart.
My husband makes a hundred thousand dollars a year.
I don't know what the name of that temple is.
It's not good to always rely on others.
I'm going out for a while.
That man said his name was Tom.
He caught a mouse.
"To be honest, I don't know."
There are children here.
I'll tell you all I know about it.
Have you ever seen a whale?
You're the first person to arrive.
That's a pretty good question.
Why are you working today?
Why isn't Tom wearing a name tag?
He will be here in half an hour.
Here's a pen for you to use.
Do they know French?
I'll be absent tomorrow.
I became very sleepy after a bit of reading.
Two blonde women are sitting near the fountain.
It was stormy the day before yesterday.
The snowstorm continued.
What subjects do you study at school?
Put the book on the table.
He is a tennis champion.
I can't believe you'd do such a thing to me.
Let's play tag together.
Where's your dad?
"It doesn't really matter, does it?"
It kept raining all day long.
"Tom is good at skiing, isn't he?"
You should work hard.
You should've done it earlier. It can't be helped now.
The children tried to imitate their teacher.
She was kissed by him.
Scallops are on sale today.
I wonder whether Tom will be late.
Let's go for a cup of coffee.
I've told you over and over again not to do that.
Tom has very easy-to-read handwriting.
Is Tom here now?
My dog follows me whenever I leave the room.
Who made Tom do that?
It's been raining since yesterday.
He made up his mind to become a pilot.
Tom is too old to work here.
You'll forget about me someday.
"He did well in all subjects and, above all, in mathematics."
The poor girl was on the point of death.
My husband will be back soon.
I shouldn't have eaten so much.
The accident occurred yesterday morning.
"You don't know how to use it, do you?"
The tickets are already sold out.
I have no control over that.
What's a computer hard drive?
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.
"I think that you'll like it, too."
I slipped the letter to him.
You run.
Now I'm living in Boston.
I wonder if the weather will hold.
Which cup should I use?
He's out of the office because he's in Osaka on business.
I think that Tom hates Mary.
She concealed the fact that she used to be a salesgirl.
The teacher gave way to the students' demand.
English is spoken around the world.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
He was unwilling to go.
Please be careful not to let the dog outside.
It was the same all year round.
Tom went to Boston to propose to Mary.
I need to talk with you.
Can I borrow your pen?
I live near the train station.
"He said to himself, ""Will this operation result in success?"""
"I thought we had eaten everything in the house, but I found another box of crackers."
I'll go get changed.
It looks as if it is going to rain.
Look at those flowers.
I should change my profile picture.

He has no chance of recovering.
The street was slippery.
Would you like something to drink?

Take off your hat when you enter a classroom.
It's not far from here.
I've heard enough already. Please leave.
I'm in Perth.
Were there many people watching?
Tom spent three days in the hospital.
I'm sorry I can't attend your party.
The baby is sleeping.
I don't want a sandwich.
I will write down your name and address.
Please bring me my bill.
I couldn't believe it.
I haven't seen you for a while.
She's very afraid of snakes.
I'd like to open a bank account.
Tom is my younger sister's husband.
Do you care what kind of music we listen to?
My father has gone out to buy a postcard.
He went abroad.
We had a little trouble with the equipment yesterday.
"Judging by the swelling, the man must have been bitten by a snake."
Ten years is a long time.
"Sorry, the book is out of stock."
I don't want to get married too soon.
I think you're quite right.
Why is Tom always so quiet?
Is everyone still listening?
Do you have a headache?
Tom says he did nothing illegal.
Is it OK if I sit here?
Japanese is often said to be a difficult language to learn.
Tom is the only student at this school that Mary knows.
I collect stamps as a hobby.
I'm sick and tired of hearing the same thing over and over again.
There are books and a notebook on the desk.
Should I speak French?
It's very decent of you to help me.
The wound left a scar on my arm.
My father put up the house for sale.
Was Tom born in Australia?
We had some visitors yesterday.
Has Tom been crying?
I study French in addition to English.
I got my eyes tested.
That's a splendid idea.
Can I speak to the person in charge?
Please write to me from time to time.
"During the war, we often had to make do without sugar."
What time is it?
Where he will live doesn't interest us.
Where are you going?
That's a good idea.
The eagle is the king of birds.
We caught some large fish there.
I don't deserve to live.
He has a head on his shoulders.
I know where she is.
He has a split personality.
Our favorite place to eat is that small restaurant on the corner.
"Tom can speak French, too."
I didn't understand your question.
You can't go out.
We know where Tom is.
The party is over.
This song is catchy.
Tom was sitting on a bench eating something that looked like an apple.
The girl wearing the blue coat is my daughter.
I continued singing.
I'm busy doing homework.
Take a wild guess.
We didn't need to eat breakfast so early.
Tom and I still aren't planning on doing that.
Everybody knows that two and two make four.
I sang well.
Talk as quietly as you can. The kids are sleeping.
I saw your friend here yesterday.
Will you show me how to use this camera?
I was nearly hit by a car.
Please drop in on your way home.
I was invited to the party.

Tom really hates this kind of thing.
I'd appreciate some advice.

Tom asked several questions.
She gave me a piece of good advice.
He's much younger than Tom.
Everything is ruined because of you.
The family ate dinner together.

I do want to go to Australia.
Don't confuse desire with love.
There are a number of movie theaters in this city.

He deemed it wise to accept the offer.
I've come here to help you.
How old is this temple?
Are you interested in politics?
Honey bees are vegetarians.
I don't think it's odd.
The parents could not help scolding their little child.
She hasn't turned up yet.
"I want to see the ocean, too."
I have just eaten lunch.
I found a dog just inside the gate.
Tom drove to the airport to meet Mary.
I'd like to live a quiet life in the country after I retire.
I showed him into the room.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.
Stand up when your name is called.
Do you have any money?
Two to the power of five equals thirty-two.
"Let me get you a cup of coffee. ""I'd appreciate that."""
Tom said almost nothing.
He wrote the report.
I visited the village he was born in.
"In the end, I found out what was wrong with my TV."
She greeted me with a smile.
My name is Tom.
Tom was able to get there in less than twenty minutes.
A dog has a sharp sense of smell.
Might I come in?
"Actually, I don't like Tom."
It's next to impossible to finish it in a day.
She says she wants to change.
It's your book.
There is a pond in the middle of the park.
I got mad.
I've never seen anyone do that before.
I can't talk to you about that now.
Are you mad?
"If that's what you want to do, I'll help you do it."
That isn't an issue anymore.
The loss adds up to more than one million dollars.
Do you have any children?
Did you get the package I sent you?
Where's the telephone book?
Do you have a boyfriend?
I got wet to the skin.
I think I'll be back in about 30 minutes.
"Tom is still the same, right?"
When did Tom start dating Mary?
"Last night was great, wasn't it?"
Why do you care?
After two days our food gave out.
"Foods rich in vitamin E include dark-green, leafy vegetables, beans, nuts and whole-grain cereals."
Gasoline is used for fuel.
It was nice to meet you today.
What's the cash limit on this card?
Make sure you save the receipt.
Read and translate this text.
Nobody believes what I say.
There are six apples in the box.
I've already told Tom everything.
I don't care for coffee.
This is delicious.
Tom is the only person who could've stolen Mary's necklace.
Is there anyone here taller than Tom?
I wonder if Tom has ever considered buying a smaller car.
Leaf after leaf fell to the ground.
The only thing that Tom knows how to cook is scrambled eggs.
You can't tame a wolf.
Beat the eggs.
"If you say anything about this to anyone, we're through."
Tom gave the picture to Mary.
Tom can count to ten.
The library is in the middle of the city.
"As soon as I sat down, I fell asleep."
I'm doing well.
Are you telling me that you've never been to Boston?
This is the Town Hall.
I decided to stay home.
Mountain climbing isn't something I really enjoy so much.
This year we had more snow than last year.
It was not until I reached home that I missed my purse.
She didn't feel comfortable with my friend.
Tom jumped bail.
Your shipment should be delivered within 24 hours.
I'm doing this for our kids' future.
I don't know who he is.
She's muttering to herself.
I got a new hat at the department store.
"You wanted this, didn't you?"
No other city in Japan is as big as Tokyo.
The matter was settled.
Please wait a sec.
"You said so the other day, didn't you?"
I had never been on a plane before.
He skimmed through the report.
"Mom, don't worry. I'm not alone."
My mother is sick in bed.
There's no way I'll win.
I don't think that this movie is interesting.
People are suffering from the contamination of the water supply.
I try to read at least a few pages a day.
I'm thirteen.
Do you by any chance have some aspirin?
The boy was so tired that he couldn't take one more step.
"The train was late, but I still got to work on time."
I hear he met with some kind of misfortune while he was in Europe.
She was reluctant to reveal her secret.
Tom loved watching sports.
It'll be better in two or three days.
Tom is the only one with the key to this cabinet.
This book is for students whose native language is not Japanese.
I want to know when my baggage is going to arrive.
Where are your friends from?
I think that you're to blame.
I'm interested in creating my own web pages.
It's for my personal use.
I bought a house in 2013.
Can you speak more clearly?
The rain prevented me from going out.
I'll print it quickly.
Tom is my new roommate.
"Tom wasn't home yesterday, was he?"
I still have a lot of time for fun.
My father drinks a cup of coffee every morning.
Will you pay cash?
He came back soon.
"Because of illness, she couldn't come."
I'll reconsider the matter.
Let's split the bill.
There's something I've always wanted to ask you.
Tom will be thrilled.
He lives alone.
She's an early riser.
"Sorry, I forgot."
Did you buy a cantaloupe?
I don't want to meet Tom.
I need Tom.
Somebody caught me by the arm.
Does Tom speak French better than Mary?
Tom doesn't like to talk about that.
Tom probably won't want to tag along.
That's not my problem.
He tried to open the door.
Tom is smiling again.
We sell sugar by the pound.
I'm going to rent a car.
The noise kept me awake all night.
She isn't poor.
My father graduated from Harvard University.
Please help me take this down.
Tom is reading a novel.
There are three cows in the cowshed.
This is a serious issue.
School starts at 8:30.
I left part of the meal uneaten.
I must find Tom.
My parents haven't come home yet.
I really hate those.
The can is empty.
His house is somewhere around here.
I can't remember doing that.
I'm working from home today.
My French is still not very good.
Just answer the questions.
Tom got up an hour early.
I caught a cold last month.
I'll call him later.
The egg is a universal symbol of life and rebirth.
Please keep that secret.
What would you do in this situation?
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
Your bicycle is similar to mine.
Have you ever visited someone in prison?
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
We've had bad weather recently.
He's overconfident.
I used to write in my diary every day when I was young.
Mary had a dream that she won the lottery.
Please come into the room.
I have bad eyesight.
It's never too late to learn.
She usually walks to school.
Will you wait a moment?
"After days of warm weather, it became cold."
All of us like Tom.
I wonder if it'll rain tomorrow.
I know a lot of French songs.
This medicine only works for men.
The heavy rain prevented them from going there.
It isn't my fault.
Please turn off the camera.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I think ghosts exist.
The fat white cat sitting on the wall was watching the two of them with sleepy eyes.
I don't need anything now.
She didn't have much money.
That almost made me laugh.
My grandmother's hair is white.
The line is busy again.
He dressed up as a woman.
I didn't pick it up.
How do you spend your free time?
Every student passed the driving test.
They got off the bus and walked two kilometers in the hot sun.
I usually cut the crust off bread.
I didn't know what to say to him.
Did you take them home?
I don't have time to help you today.
I don't think that you can do this.
"As is often the case with 13 to 19 year olds, she fell in love."
Tom said that Mary isn't angry.
Mary and Alice are both pregnant.
Are you surprised?
Tom ate a pear.
The soccer game attracted a large crowd.
Good luck.
I need to put air in the tires.
Tom sat down on the sofa.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
There doesn't seem to be anyone around.
How many bags of potato chips did you buy?
I cut the crust off the bread.
May I open the curtains?
Are you thinking about me?
Some women think bald-headed men are sexy.
I thought I heard someone banging on the wall.
How many flights to New York do you offer a day?
They yelled.
He is a good athlete.
He filled the bottle with water.
My wife wanted to adopt a child.
My brother-in-law is older than I am.
The food is getting cold.
Tell Tom to pick up the phone.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
"On Fridays, I go to work in jeans."
I'd like to find out my bank balance.
I don't like to leave things up in the air.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
"Excuse me, could you show me how to use the washing machine?"
I wish I had ridden my bicycle here.
The police arrested the man who had murdered the girl.
This has nothing to do with you.
Tom moved to Boston three years ago.
Millions of trees have been cut down for fuel.
I'll join you later.
Tom prefers to spend his time outside.
Man is the only animal that can speak.
How many drinks have you had tonight?
I fell in love with a married man.
May I ask a question?
"I like team sports like soccer, hockey, basketball, and volleyball."
I have an ulcer in my mouth.
What time are we leaving?
Helping others is never a waste of time.
Please forgive me.
Calm down.
Mary is beautiful.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
"Strange to say, she suddenly disappeared."
What are you doing in my car?
You aren't very smart.
She's my sister.
Drink this. It'll make you feel better.
We moved to New York last fall.
I warmed myself at the fire.
I can't say.
Just don't get hurt.
Thank you for your hard work.
Were you busy last Monday afternoon?
I'm the type who likes to think things over very carefully.
How many cows do you have?
Look at my new car.
She dropped out of school.
What time will you get up tomorrow?
We learn a good deal at school.
Can I make a reservation?
I'll call at seven.
I can't talk about this right now.
They've decided not to come.
This is the last game.
My father died of cancer.
I escaped the accident by the skin of my teeth.
I need a few people to help me.
I don't really like going to school very much.
Who'll look after your cat while you are away?
"Hey, if dinner isn't ready by seven, I'm going to a restaurant."
Don't walk so fast.
I'll come by 10.
You don't have to come if you don't want to.
That book is big.
I grow many kinds of roses.
He is admired as a writer.
The pain has lessened a bit.
You shouldn't depend on your parents.
What do they mean?
I don't know what to do next.
We must not speak ill of others behind their backs.
I have a flat tire.
"I don't know if it's important to you, but it's very important to me."
Are you here?
How is the weather?
"That's not really the issue, is it?"
I often go to the bookstore.
I'll get it.
I don't know who he is.
Are you from Boston?
Please help me with this.
Are you using that?
Please pay attention to what I'm saying.
Is the cat all right?
She caught sight of his face.
I bought two loaves of bread.
"The richer he became, the more he wanted."
We must be as kind to old people as possible.
The police caught the thief.
I feel great.
We went to the river.
I didn't study at all.
Tom visits me every time he comes to Australia.
How did you come by this painting?
Where are we?
I am doubtful of his success.
I want to drink something fizzy.
You'd better do that now.
We all make mistakes.
Birds are flying above the trees.
I'm lonely.
Christianity and Islam are two different religions.
I need to read more.
Which cheese is best for pizza?
Tom fell into the river.
There was nobody in the house.
Tom failed the French test.
You may sit here.
I have a bad cold.
What shall I begin with?
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Are you saying you're not going to college?
I don't want any sandwiches.
"Right at that instant, the bus stopped."
"If Tom had been able to speak French better, he would've been able to tell everybody how he really felt."
I go to the museum whenever I get the chance.
His mother was right.
"Today, too, I woke up with a headache."
She had her hair cut short.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Allow three weeks for delivery.
There must've been an accident up ahead.
Do you know whose tie this is?
He's really a good guy.
I can't possibly do it.
Come sit next to me.
You promised not to laugh.
I got up too late and was late for school.
Don't be scared.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
I've left my glasses at home.
Tom swam in the pool.
I'm kind of tired today.
I'd prefer not to sing today.
What did you have for breakfast?
I have no money to buy the book with.
I thought that that was your job.
Are you ever late for class?
I think we shouldn't be doing this.
Whose bike is it?
My watch has been stolen.
Thank you very much for sending me such a nice present.
His hobby is painting pictures.
Does Tom play baseball?
A baby has delicate skin.
"Hey, do you guys want to order a pizza?"
I'm free.
I don't know whether it's good.
He's very good at playing baseball.
I was raised in Boston.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
"My uncle went to Mexico in 1983, never to come back."
Why do you always speak to me in English? Is it because I'm a foreigner?
Tom was afraid Mary would say no.
I don't mind your staying here.
Thank you very much.
"It's grammatically correct, but a native speaker would never say it like that."
How far is it from here to the station?
Tom owns a yellow sports car.
I'm selling my car.
I thought that you two would have a lot in common.
Tom tried to shut the door.
Could you give me something to drink?
How many times a week does the soccer team practice?
I'd like to rent a car.
She achieved her goal.
Tom was fired.
I wanted to surprise her.
Why do you have a picture of Tom in your wallet?
Try it once again.
This hen does not lay eggs at all these days.
The tropical sun glared down relentlessly.
I'm not actually from Australia.
Can you eat durian?
I think we'll tag along.
Please return the book by tomorrow.
You need not have come so early.
He is a good carpenter.
Tom crawled into bed and fell asleep immediately.
Am I boring you?
Please call before you come.
Come to my house at eight.
Which way are you going?
Are you done?
Tom didn't believe what Mary said.
I want to eat a piece of cake.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
They've announced their engagement.
Is Tom able to drive a truck?
I don't know.
I really am unlucky!
How far can you drive your car on empty?
I didn't know anybody at the party.
"I'm sorry, but I'm already dating someone."
Don't tell anyone my secret.
"If I were you, I would paint it blue."
Tom doesn't remember where he put his key.
That cloud looks like a rabbit.
Please wait a bit.
What did you do when those people attacked you?
I don't think Tom knows I'm Mary's brother.
What're you doing?
There used to be a hut around here.
Helping others is never a waste of time.
I bought lace curtains for my bedroom windows.
Tests start next week.
Smoking in a car with a child under 16 is against the law.
The others will arrive in a few minutes.
My mother made me a new suit.
He hit me on the head.
This is a pen.
"You're not married, are you?"
People say Tom is very smart.
I want to get my driver's license.
Let's change the subject.
"I'm sorry, but you're wrong."
He was thirsty.
I would like to buy a new coat at that department store.
"Hey, stop complaining."
What're you in such a hurry for?
Is there anything else you want me to do?
I've got to shave before leaving.
I don't have time.
Tom went shopping with his girlfriend.
I know where you live.
I can't make any sense of this.
Tom likes listening to the radio when he's driving.
She has always been a popular actress.
Are you all listening to me?
What surprised me most when I first entered college was how few of my classmates knew how to study efficiently.
Be kind to old people.
Let's discuss the plan over a cup of coffee.
Would you like some of those cookies?
You have beautiful hands.
Who was Tom planning to go swimming with?
What's making you so busy?
"Eventually, I'd like to start my own company."
I had no idea you were coming.
The country's economy depends on agriculture.
Are Tom and Mary related?
Your cake is delicious.
I think that Tom is good-looking.
What did you just say?
I was caught in a shower and got drenched to the skin.
Do you want to buy some milk?
He's a man of many talents.
Children love cake.
Are they paying you extra to work late?
We're going to see a foreign film tonight.
May I have another brochure?
"Just then, I heard the telephone ring."
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
I felt uncomfortable because I couldn't speak French.
Tom narrowly escaped death.
When was that?
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
I'm simply looking.
She doesn't listen to him.
I don't like being on a diet.
I'm not tired at all.
I'd like to borrow about three hundred thousand dollars.
Is Tom still crying?
She told her children an amusing story.
He is good-looking and smart.
We intend to look into that matter.
Don't sass me.
We don't get along with each other.
"Bring the table outside, please."
I'm looking forward to it.

He looked in at the door.
What did you write?
My father has been out of work for a year.
Tom said that he could see ghosts.
"She promised to marry him, but she didn't."
I made several mistakes.
If only the rain would stop.
Tom doesn't go anywhere alone.
I visited him in the hospital.
May I eat this?
The experiment failed.
The reporters continued to ask questions.
I thought you were still in Australia.
Make a sentence with each of these words.
Have you ever had a boyfriend?
One word is enough for a wise man.
I'm afraid I took your umbrella by mistake.
"Judging from the look of the sky, we might have a shower before nightfall."
We could see nothing but fog.
Please go on.
May I take some time off next week?
Tom sat down beside Mary.
I was fined thirty dollars for speeding.
What do you want?
The pond is frozen.
Do you remember what I was wearing the first time we met?
The leaves on the trees change color in the autumn.
They're already here.
That's perfectly natural.
Tom asked me if I knew anybody who could translate from French into English.
I got to the bus stop just after the bus had left.
The actual price was lower than I thought it would be.
What is today's date?
I've never heard her speak ill of others.
Let me introduce myself.
Where would you like to go next?
Planes dropped bombs on the city.
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
Where do you think he lives?
My house is fully insured.
Will you help me with my English homework?
Put it in your pocket.
This is drinking water.
He's always been living in Tokyo.
Thank you for today.
Tom lied to me.
Tom laid his racket on the ground.
What time is it now by your watch?
Nonsense!
Is that for sale?
It was extraordinary that he did not agree.
Accuracy is important in arithmetic.
Nowadays anybody can get books.
I was born in 1960.
Our teacher is always on time for class.
They didn't call me back.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
Has he arrived yet?
Have you ever eaten whale meat?
"Since I wrote the report in a hurry, it had many mistakes."
I'd like to take a couple of days off next week.
Are you sick? You look pale.
I considered Tom a friend.
It's our anniversary tomorrow.
I recommend a thorough checkup for your husband.
I hope that I'll be able to help you at some other time.
I'm looking for my mobile phone.
How many days ago did you buy milk?
He wants to learn how to cook.
Tom made up his mind to go.
Tom was too tired to speak.
No more than 50 people came.
He is just an ordinary person.
I don't want to hear any complaints.
Tom scored a hole in one.
Come quickly!
All the leaves have fallen.
The large audience applauded when the song finished.
Are you planning to go to that store?
Tom has hardly eaten anything.
Please write to me once in a while.
I've just finished my homework.
I translated everything Tom wrote into French.
I have been associated with him for ten years.
Did Tom know the answer?
Tom is out.
Let Tom live.
"The moment she was alone, she opened the letter."
"Tom is awfully quiet today, isn't he?"
We're not open on Monday.
It began to rain five minutes after I left home.
Some families spend their vacation near the beach.
I felt a touch of pain in my head.
Tom gave Mary a rose.
It was impossible for the boy to swim across that river.
"Hey, did you hear that?"
"Fully booked for the night, the hotel had to turn away some late guests."
We get a lot of rain in June.
I'll see you later.
Did you check all the items on the shopping list?
Go to bed early.
Tom lives in Boston.
She thought about that matter all the time.
What country is Boston in?
I'm surprised to see you here.
I'm learning music.
I walked in the woods by myself.
Whose desk is this?
Are you familiar with this area?
I lowered my meat consumption.
These are beautiful flowers.
Please listen carefully to what I have to say.
Japan's population is larger than Canada's.
Children grow up fast.
Tom wanted to dance.
Sheep feed on grass.
You can sleep here if you want.
All of the cookies are in the shape of stars.
Why do you think that?
Would it be OK if I tried doing that?
The plane still hasn't taken off.
A true friend would've acted differently.
This is what I was waiting for.
Take whichever you want.
Why did you come here?
Don't complain.
The children were sliding on the ice.
Tom and Mary each drank three cups of coffee before they left for work.
Those two make such a cute couple.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
We stopped to take pictures.
What else have you lied to me about?
You must get ready quickly.
Tom didn't realize who that man was.
"When you come next time, bring your brother."
A typhoon's coming.
What are you drawing?
"Listen, it wasn't meant like that."
I helped him with his homework.
Eat a lot of vegetables.
He narrowly escaped being run over.
Have you ever kissed someone in public?
Remember to lock the door.
This ticket is valid for two days after purchase.
"Mother Teresa was a Catholic nun who lived and worked in Calcutta, India."
Please wait a little while longer.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the last train."
I forgot to put film in the camera.
"Did you kiss him? ""Yes, I kissed him."""
He's just an ordinary man.
She's six years older than me.
My blood pressure is 155 over 105.
I didn't expect such a nice present from you.
Could I get some tea?
Buy me the red one.
Tom goes to Boston every year.
"If it rains tomorrow, we'll go by car."
Some of the dogs are alive.
It is raining hard now.
I don't understand why Tom is so mad.
"You don't need to speak to Tom in sign language, because he can read lips really well."
Could I ask one more question?
Tom breathed deeply.
This is hard for me to say.
I have work on Monday.
When is the deadline?
"That restaurant is cheap, but the food's not good."
Cheer up! Things aren't as bad as you think.
Stop acting like such a fool.
Take mine.
The bellboy will show you to your room.
Today's weather forecast says that it is likely to be fine tomorrow.
I'm going shopping this afternoon. Would you like to come along?
You ought to keep your promise.
"For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that."
I've been looking forward to hearing from you for weeks.
Would you like to have another beer?
Staying home isn't fun.
He has no girlfriend.
May I use the bathroom?
"If you're busy, I'll help you."
You're not a good learner.
Which way should I go?
May all your dreams come true.
I hid under the desk.
I know it's my fault.
"Sorry, I don't think I can do it."
This pamphlet is free of charge.
They gave a series of concerts.
I didn't ask him.
I sleep on a cot.
Tom often smiles.
A dove is a symbol of peace.
Tom can come tomorrow.
Tom doesn't smoke anymore.
She looked around.
Do you think French is easy?
Did you write that?
Who will compensate for the loss?
It seems that supper will be late.
This is the latest fashion.
How do you turn on this computer?
Can you play chess well?
Tell me your impressions.
Tom says he isn't lazy.
People live only about 70 years.
Books are made out of paper.
I've known Tom for over three years.
You don't have to pay attention to what Tom says.
I'll go and look for Tom.
The bus will arrive at the station in fifteen minutes.
Tom didn't text Mary back.
Tom flipped through the channels.
Do you have an appointment with him?
Is there somewhere nearby I can park my car?
Our boss is very sweet on the new girl.
"I think this is OK, but I'm not sure."
I got sand in my eye.
The weather is sure to be wet.
I'd like to try on one size smaller than this.
I have nothing particular to say now.
What was the outcome?
It's just a mechanical problem.
Give me a little more water.
Tom retired at the age of 65.
I'll call you tomorrow afternoon.
He is a member in good standing.
Tom wakes up early.
Picasso kept drawing pictures until he was 91 years old.
Please give me three of these.
She's busy.
I am fed up with talking to her.
Tom is very good at math.
Tom fell in love with Mary.
Please let me do it.
Fasten your seat belt.
Nowadays you no longer hear popular songs that can be sung by men and women of all ages.
People who drink alcoholic beverages are not allowed to enter.
The ambulance has arrived.
Did you invite him?
I'm worried about your health.
I shook hands with her.
What's that?
I washed my hands.
Tom didn't turn off the lights.
All I can do at the moment is wait.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
Did you really buy all these?
She returned his kiss.
I'm going to my sister's.
I have to go to the station at once.
He's often mistaken for a student.
When are you going to get married?
It's very important to get enough rest.
"Will you show me your ticket? ""Yes, of course."""
He looked well.
How should I eat ths?
I thought you wanted a divorce.
He might say something ambiguous again.
A red light was glowing in the dark.
We should all go.
I saw the news on TV this morning.
Why do the five yen coin and the fifty yen coin have holes in the center?
Is Tom ready?
Call me at the office.
Two years have passed since I last met you.
Could you please open the door?
You can see the sun setting from the window.
That factory makes toys.
Let's get out of here.
"Please eat. You're hungry, aren't you?"
There isn't time to explain in detail.
Tom called a taxi for me.
She's stubborn.
I don't want to buy anything I don't need.
How about inviting Tom to our party?

Do you like San Francisco?
This door locks by itself.
I heard something fall to the ground.
"Frankly speaking, he's wrong."
How about doing a bit of research on your own before asking for help?
I don't think Tom did this.
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.
It rained during the night.
What time does the meeting start?
How was yesterday's movie?
I have a cold.
I think it's better you stay here until the snow stops.
I wish I were dead.

"I didn't know that you could cook this well, Tom."
This fruit can be eaten.
It's time for your shot.
Tom has recovered.
What an absurd idea!
How's your new job?
I take back what I said.
Don't look out the window. Concentrate on your work.
Tom always seems to be in a bad mood.
Will we be in time for the plane if we leave now?

My girlfriend is a lot taller than I am.
"Could you spell your name for me, please?"
They attained their goal.
It's for sale.
There were a lot of murders last year.
I don't have a camera.
Let me try it.
The well ran dry.
Tom seems very happy.
This room isn't very large.
He hid himself behind the door.
Tom drives.
The company was in the red and went under.
Can I do anything to help?
It takes an hour to walk to the station.
There's nothing you can do.
I want to kiss you.
We scarcely had time for lunch.
The lion is the king of the beasts.
The exam is coming up next week.

"How are you? ""I'm fine, thank you."""
Please give me a glass of water.
He has set up a new business.
Is there anybody there?
The top floor is an attic.
We're still up.
Are those Tom's sons?
Tom was the last one to leave the classroom.
Nothing happened.
Are the elevators working?
This lid is too tight for me to open.
Today I have a lot of things to do.
That book sold out.
Tom trusts Mary completely.
I don't know when I'll have time to visit you.
Tom leaned on Mary's shoulder.
It's a difficult choice.
There are a lot of stars which are larger than our sun.
Do you plan to go abroad?
How would you like your eggs?
Is that really necessary?
Would you like to have another cup of tea?
Go away!
Did you talk about your hobby?
I'm certain that I'll win the tennis match.
Let's get together tonight.
The hunting dogs followed the scent of the fox.
I made up my mind to study harder.
I had doubts.
What's the difference?
Listen to me very carefully.

I have never seen her help her father.
Where should we meet?
He found his father lying in the kitchen.
You had better take an umbrella.
Why is the bus stopping?
There are a lot of places to see around here.
Don't make noise.
I've been to the station to meet a friend.
I borrowed this beach umbrella from Tom.
I went home.
I loved reading when I was a child.
It is almost three.
He has been to the station to see her off.
I'm waiting for an important phone call.
There is not much difference between the two.
I like taking pictures.
Everyone admired his courage.
"By the time you get back, she'll have left."
"You aren't a mechanic, are you?"
Your father is tall.
We can't leave until 6 o'clock.
Our university has excellent sports facilities.
I didn't get even one letter from her.
What has happened?
Can you tell me where I am on this map?
Why didn't you dance with him?
Tom is a good French speaker.
We walked along the river.
I'm never at home on Sundays.
The new engine must undergo all the necessary tests.
Do you remember me?
She persuaded him to marry her.
Are you hiding something?
It was nice of you to come all this way to see me.
"This is Tom's shirt, not mine."
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
They do it just for the thrill of it.
Parents may favor the youngest child in the family.
Tom and Mary don't have any children.
Do as you like.
Is this really possible?
May I have a moment of your time?
That's all in the past now.
Was Tom the one who did this?
Who broke the vase?
The red belt makes her black dress look even better.
Have you read this book already?
Tom was well-behaved.
Please come downstairs.
That isn't difficult.
Tom is thinking.
I thought we could be friends.
How long has Tom been in there?
Tell Tom in person.
Tom hates spiders.
I'm a tenth grader.
I don't actually have that much money.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
Don't tell Tom.
Children should drink milk every day.
"Before I could protest, I was handcuffed and was on my way to prison."
Cherries are red.
We don't have any sugar.
The house is in need of repair.
"To hear him speak English, you would take him for a native."
I'll ask him about it tomorrow.
Wait till I count to ten.
I don't know how I should do it.
Go and find Tom.
I was invited to a party hosted by Tom.
I don't think that Tom will get here on time.
Let's do it at Tom's house.
"The weather was fine, so we went fishing."
I feel tired.
"Come on, Tom, think about it."
You don't need to speak that loudly.
This is the first time that I've had seaweed.
I'm looking forward to good news.
Don't go out after it gets dark.
Why did you come here?
Sorry for the interruption.
The school is only a five-minute walk.
Onions cook more quickly than potatoes.
"When you have a cold, you should drink plenty of liquids."
Tom is my half brother.
Have you finished cleaning your room yet?
"Will you open the window, please?"
Where did you learn to dance?
Tom flipped on the light.
She's looking for a better job.
Who's the person that's standing in front of that building?
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to take vitamins.
He shook his head.
What is your astrological sign?
She hates him.
Do you come here often?
The deadline was not met.
Tom doesn't like sports.
Tom said he'd like to visit Australia.
This watch is waterproof.
It was a long time ago.
Take care of yourselves!
Did you buy the house you said you wanted to buy?
I usually don't wear a hat.
I can't bear this noise anymore.
I was in time for the train.
The dog was hit by a truck.
What should we do during our next vacation?
"The food wasn't very delicious, but otherwise the party was a success."
Pick me up 2:30 in front of the main gate.
Tom was wearing a mask.
It looks like an old-fashioned general store.
I sat on a bench and waited.
Do you want to put on weight?
My father goes jogging every morning.
Tom screamed for help.
My sister can swim very fast.
"Someday, you'll understand."
I drink coffee without sugar if I have chocolate.
You should study French harder.
I hate shopping.
Am I the only one who thinks that person looks like Obama?
I'm staying for another few weeks.
What's your favorite music group?
I don't like this jacket.
She called me many a time.
Tom admitted that he knew the secret.
I arrived an hour early for my appointment.
I don't like to cook when it's hot outside.
There are some things money can't buy.
I want everything in order by this time tomorrow.
I've done all I can.
How about pizza for lunch today?
I was born and raised here.
Look at the cat.
I've written a letter.
I've promised Tom I would help.
We may not be able to afford it.
It is as warm today as yesterday.
He succeeded in business.
Are you meeting someone here?
Do you have any light beer?
Tom is a talkative child.
"In order to lose weight, it is best to take up some sport."
Just help me with this baggage.
It's cold.
Come whenever you want to.
"Either way, you lose."
We're through.
Tom said he wants to keep working here.
"Would you speak more slowly, please?"
May I bother you for a moment?
The game was called off because of the rain.
It smells like rain.
It's too large.
May I call around 2:30?
Tom thinks he knows best.
Christmas is just two weeks away.
"At the moment, there isn't anyone in the office."
Leave me alone.
He had been a practitioner of Aikido for seven years.
I think they should put a heavy tax on imports.
"Tom and Mary are both angry, aren't they?"
The storm didn't abate for several hours.
We want to go to Australia.
I mean to be there this evening.
I get along well with all the staff.
Tom didn't eat much.
They're not my real parents.
We didn't have much fun.
How awful!
What's your favorite 90's song?
Tom is grinning.
How fast does this train run?
That book is of no use.
His absence was due to the storm.
The results were very good.
It is nice and warm today.
Get away from here.
It's still open.
How long do you intend to stay?
I don't like heavy makeup on a young girl.
She reached for the bag.
I'm feeling much better today.
The mother cat went out hunting birds.
Who said that to you?
I want to eat cheese.
"Some go to school by bicycle, others go by bus."
Please throw the ball to me.
I met her on my way to school.
We were sweating in the heat.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow morning.
I went home on foot.
Do you want anything to eat?
He invested his money in stocks.
Did you forget to wax the floor again?
Don't use your phone while driving.
Please make yourself at home.
Please wait here for a while.
I learned a lot from what I heard.
The meeting ended at 2:30.
Tom comes here every three days.
I had a sandwich for lunch.
Come a little closer.
I was questioned by a police officer.
I'm sorry that I didn't reply to you sooner.
My family goes skiing every winter.
I felt lonely.
That is his house.
Tom still hasn't found his passport.
"Without water, the flowers wilted."
He did not turn up after all.
"Can you lend me 10,000 yen?"
She is aged seventeen.
"If it were not for the sun, we could not live at all."
Man is the only animal that can make use of fire.
I've been a disappointment to my parents.
She left France for America.
Figs are delicious.
That'll do.
I need to be home on Monday.
You'd better call a lawyer.
I have a lot of things to do today.
Welcome back.
I can see a woman and two dogs in the car.
Are you cross?
He told me about the accident as if he had seen it with his own eyes.
Everyone is very excited.
I had a bad stomachache.
Is it OK if I sit here?
Tom bought some chocolate for Mary.
Tom is painting a picture.
"As soon as Tom got out of the bath, he ate dinner."
Have you brushed your teeth?
Do you have any messages for me?
Time for dinner.
What are you cooking?
"I was hungry, so I ate it."
You've bought more stamps than necessary.
India gained independence from Britain in 1947.
"Speak slower, please."
Thank you very much for lending me $500 when I was having difficulty making ends meet.
It is twenty minutes past ten.
The heat is intense.
It's a nice idea.
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
We gathered around the teacher.
Is there life on Mars?
I feel lousy.
There is no salt left.
Beware of pickpockets.
Are you happy with how you look?
Tom barely said anything.
We must think over the issues carefully.
This book is hard for me to read.
I think he is a good man.
That's none of your beeswax.
No one can escape growing old.
Are those people from Canada?
Tom's work environment was good.
I want to join the army.
Do you take sugar in your coffee?
We had dinner at a restaurant.
I can't thank you enough.
It's a temporary condition.
I'd like another beer.
I don't have what you want.
Who threw a stone at my dog?
My body is stiff.
French is an interesting language.
We went to Gifu.
I love reading books.
She trembled with fear.
I'm an office worker.
I'll give you a call in the morning.
It's good that I have a daughter.
He is always laughing.
Don't worry. We'll find it.
I couldn't solve the puzzle.
This is the umbrella I bought yesterday.
I'm really enjoying the challenge.
The computer is off.
I own some very old stamps.
How old is this?
Where did you come from?
May I borrow your car?
I know that it's my fault.
I can't answer that.
This neighborhood is a good place to raise children.
The handle of the cup is broken.
You're wanted on the phone. It's from Tom.
"If I were you, I'd start immediately."
Tom tried to scare Mary.
"You like it, don't you?"
Tom's cellphone rang.
The old lady lived in a three-room apartment by herself.
I wish I had tried harder to get along with everyone in the class.
It's her job.
I'll look forward to it.
Does your mother know about this?
I'm coming with you.
I think actions speak louder than words.
I'll soon finish reading this novel.
I doubt that our new boss will be any worse than the old one.
This room doesn't get much sun.
Oranges grow in warm countries.
Did you eat it all?
Making such a large sale is a feather in the salesman's cap.
I haven't read all of his novels.
I only know French.
I received your message yesterday.
I wish I were as young as you.
Cheese can easily be cut with a knife.
Where's your granddaughter?
I bought this book at the book store in front of the station.
You should return what you borrow.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
I think we're too late.
I've just returned from Australia.
The museum's closed on Mondays.
They say that they don't need money.
Please come to talk to me.
Tom is coughing.
I lost my watch.
My father was satisfied with the result.
She didn't plan on having a fight with him.
He turned traitor.
I'm a bit hungry.
Let's stop here for today.
It's my fault that the cake was burned. I was talking on the phone and didn't notice the time.
I envy Tom's job.
Tom has already gone to sleep.
Do you want some pudding?
"Let me know where you're staying, OK?"
What subject are you good at?
Did you have a nice summer?
I'm glad to meet you.
Where's your favorite place to eat in Boston?
You shouldn't trust that man.
This building is made of stone.
Have you finished your preparations for the trip?
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
My wife is three years younger than me.
A molecule of water is made up of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.
I have a cold.
There are no houses around here.
Nobody complained about that.
What's your shoe size?
It looks like it's going to rain tomorrow.
Choose whichever you like.
You should always save money for a rainy day.
I don't have anything to throw.
Can you tell wheat from barley?
I wonder if Tom is really married.
How about October 20th at 2:30 p.m.?
Choose your words carefully.
We're not afraid of competition.
Did you know Tom had a twin brother?
You'd better leave there on Monday.
I don't think that there's anyone who hates Tom.
Do you like children?
Please don't allow the children to play with knives.
The girl with long hair is Mary.
Never say never.
I believe his name is Tom.
Let's listen.
You should apologize to her.
Tom and Mary live in a very nice house.
Tom asked a stupid question.
Are you going out tonight?
I don't understand what it means.
Good job!
Don't read books in a dark place.
I can imagine how you felt.
A fox isn't caught twice in the same snare.
It occurred to me that he'd done it on purpose.
"He hurried to the house, but was disappointed to find it empty."
This book has a lot of pages.
The movie is now showing at a theater near you.
I met her in the store by accident.
I don't think Tom has a criminal record.
Swimming in the sea is fun.
There seems to be a misunderstanding.
"Since it began raining, I ran into the house."
Maybe it's time to give up.
Tom got a call from Mary.
I wonder why Tom didn't call me.
"A man as diligent as Tom is, is sure to succeed."
I've decided not to go to university.
We skied on artificial snow.
There are some oranges on the tree.
I have no clue what Tom is talking about.
Can you sew a button on?
Are you going to move to Boston?
We ran three kilometers.
We had an examination in English yesterday.
Please phone me before you come.
He has a wife and a young child.
Did you say that I could never win?
Shut the door behind you.
Don't yell at me.
"Needless to say, he never came again."
Which one do you think she chose?
The policeman grabbed the robber's arm.
"Hi, Tom."
"You are joking, right?"
She arrived in a car.
Tom's father retired early.
I'm getting up at six o'clock tomorrow morning.
I have another suggestion.
I'm no hero.
How much does that cost?
Tom trusts Mary.
It's not polite to stare at people.
I want a suit made of this material.
I'll buy Tom a pen.
This store is open 365 days a year.
The situation went from bad to worse.
I quickly found the shop I was looking for.
How was your weekend?
Tom asked me to wake him up at six-thirty.
I'm not what I used to be.
Tom opened the book.
I put my coat on the table.
Tom didn't know who it was.
Do I have to go?
Tom is not as patient as Mary.
I can't remember how to use this machine.
Tom wants a cat.
Please come the day after tomorrow.
"This is enough, isn't it? ""Yeah, I guess so."""
He listened to music in his room.
Have you finished reading this book?
He took off his hat.
Please don't forget to mail this letter.
You've already had three cups of coffee.
I want you to stay in Boston until next Monday.
"The road is icy, so take care."
Please put these glasses away.
You can see the whole city from this hill.
She promised me that she'd come.
"How late did you stay up last night? ""We were up until about 2:30."""
Tom has just gone back to Boston.
"If you go around eight, you might meet him."
Where are you from?
The cat is in the well.
I don't like you.
Jump.
I've decided to become a writer.
Is there a souvenir shop in the hotel?
We offered him a nice job.
I can't see well.
We don't talk much.
I understand.
How did you know that I was Canadian?
Stop talking about the game.
I heard that he bought a new computer.
Tom kept taking pictures.
We are influenced both by environment and by heredity.
"After I graduated from college, I moved back home and lived with my parents for three years."
He disliked school.
I agree with Tom one hundred per cent.
I can't walk yet.
Tom has a crush on Mary.
She's a kind person.
Tom is an honest person.
Tom wouldn't do a thing like that.
Don't climb on the wall.
Tom lives on the outskirts of the city.
It'll rain for sure.
Tom has blue eyes.
May I turn off the lights?
I felt better after I took a rest.
Please see to it that children do not go near the pond.
The brakes didn't work.
She bought a new house the other day.
I will stop you.
Tom wiped his glasses.
Do you care where we go?
I'm not sure when he'll come.
There's a soccer match tomorrow.
She quit the company.
Two families live in the same house.
Today is a very hot day.
The man did not so much as apologize for stepping on my foot.
Do you know anyone from Boston?
Does anybody speak French here?
Is this really necessary?
There are no chairs to sit on.
Do you go to school on foot every day?
Don't hesitate to tell me if you need anything.
You seemed to be worried about something.
Tom can understand French.
Do you accept credit cards?
I spoke to my uncle on the telephone.
The fire was soon put out.
Please sign this receipt.
He seems like a good person.
"If you want to sit, you may sit here."
You're not as young as you used to be.
Switch the light off.
Tom wasn't sleeping when I got home.
It rained a lot yesterday morning.
I can see why you like this place so much.
They caught a lion alive.
I believe you.
We have five fingers on each hand.
When was the last time you rode a bike?
Maybe you should have a little talk with Tom.
He went into the bank.
Tom is still waiting at the bus stop.
Don't waste your time and money.
I can't figure out what he really wants.
Tom has perfect pitch.
Who are you referring to?
It won't take you long to read that book.
I'm not lying.
That hat cost around fifty dollars.
Have you ever gone to see a horse race?
Is there life on other planets?
There is but one chance left.
I'm sorry about being late.
I burned the old books.
It won't be long before we can travel to Mars.
We're getting out of here. The cops are coming.
I threw up my food.
There is nothing more exciting than scuba diving.
The meeting was put off until next week.
You'd better consult your doctor.
I'm excited.
I like the smell of bread just out of the oven.
I said get out!
Tom quit the company.
He shook hands with his friend.
You must respect senior citizens.
Tom buttered his bread.
I'm sure that's no fault of yours.
I don't like this shirt. Show me another.
I don't want to be a doctor.
Tom ended up not coming.
He was wounded in the war.
How many apples are in there?
The lights were on in the room.
Make room for the baggage.
Nobody had anything more to say.
I thought you were going out with Tom.
I'll come at noon to pick you up.
We went to the zoo.
Drop your weapon or I'll shoot.
You had better go at once.
We bought new furniture.
She has this big room all to herself.
How much for half a kilo?
I'm not used to the job yet.
She would not tell me why she had gone home first.
It isn't possible to live on that island.
They needed somebody they could trust.
She was afraid of the dog.
I don't think that's so funny.

Tom has a foreign car.
I've already told Tom I plan on staying in Boston for three more weeks.
What time does the next train leave?

I hurried in order to catch the first train.
His argument was logical.
Just a minute.
The operation was successful.
Everyone in town knows about it.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't tired.
The smog was terrible today.
Let's go to Tom's house now.
I'm a member of the tennis club.
Take a bath and then go to bed.
Tom will go to the supermarket for you and buy whatever you need.
Did you sleep well?
Water boils at 212°F.
They lied.
How old are you?
Tom's busy.
This is considered to be a matter of great importance.
You should drop by his gallery if you have time.
You're kidding me.
The earth is round.
Tom got there just in the nick of time.
Tom came on Monday and went back home the next day.
Are you sure you don't remember?
You needn't have taken a taxi.
Your advice has always been very helpful to me.
Tom searched for a job online.
Seriously?
It's almost time to go home.
I arrived later than usual.
"If he doesn't come, what'll you do?"
Tom fell asleep.
I heard that you're also collecting stamps.
Tom has failed.
All of the money in the cupboard was stolen.
She has an agreeable voice.
I thought that was kind of strange.
The boys were quiet.
"I'm sorry, but I have forgotten your name."
I have something I need to do tomorrow.
The meeting that was planned for today has been canceled.
He showed me around the campus.
Do you have a rice cooker at home?
The poor are not always unhappy.
Philosophy is often regarded as difficult.
You've got to be joking!
I just want to be with you.
Tom quit smoking.
Tom dumped me.
Why are leaves green?
The cherry blossom season brings crowds of people to parks.
I thought that college would be a more interesting place.
Why did you change your mind?
You may have read this book already.
See you.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
It was yesterday when I went.
"Did you water the flowers today? ""Only in my room."""
The truth is that I don't know anything about it.
It's a book.
"Tom, can you come tomorrow?"
Your eyes are red. Are you OK?
All Tom needs is a little love and affection.
She was burning with fever.
Where's the loo?
"Since there is no air on the moon, there is no sound at all."
Tom was diagnosed with leukemia.
I lost an earring.
He changed a few words.
Tom moved.
I'll get my driver's license by the end of the year.
My father is the tallest of us all.
Is Tom lying about his age?
Is it getting worse?
Tom was shorter than me up until last year.
Tom secretly read Mary's diary while she was taking a bath.
Is eating a clove of garlic every day beneficial to your health?
Can I have a paper bag?
I didn't consider the subject seriously.
I never would've expected this to happen.
I think it's too big.
French is my native tongue.
I found it.
It's been a while since we last met.
He lost his ticket for the movie.
Not everyone can be a poet.
Have you reserved a seat?
"I have an income of 50,000 yen a month."
He has gone mad.
Everyone liked Tom.
I can't give you that much money.
Travel broadens one's horizons.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
"What happened? ""The car broke down."""
The candle went out by itself.
The radio is out of order.
Do you still have a dog?
I lent my younger brother some money.
I have a friend whose wife is a pianist.
I don't like that avatar.
"My French isn't perfect, but I can communicate well enough."
I was unable to stand any longer.
The university has a cafeteria.
Tom has never met me before.
I'm the only one in this group who doesn't speak French.
Yeah. I'm the one who called you last night.
I heard someone calling my name.
I haven't written anything.
The weather was very bad yesterday.
You could say that both of those balls are the same weight.
You'll get lost.
I have a stiff shoulder.
I can't put up with the noise any longer.
Have you ever had sushi?
I don't have time now.
Is there a cat under the table?
Can I ask some questions?
The accident took place at that corner.
I thought Tom's mother's name was Mary.
It was harder than I thought.
Please forgive me for forgetting to call you.
You're all bark and no bite.
His weight strained the rope.
He glanced at her.
I wish every day were Saturday.
Do you think I'm to blame?
I can't believe you actually got into Harvard.
"If Tom tried to do that, he could do it."
I caught a cold and was in bed yesterday.
This is a horseshoe magnet.
Tom died in a plane crash.
This is a secret.
You must not park your car there without permission.
What he had said turned out to be a lie.
I need to eat.
A card was attached to the gift.
You were sick.
"If you don't hurry, you'll be late."
Tom fell asleep at the table.
Are you still studying French?
Tom wants to move.
Tom said that Mary was good at speaking French.
I'm sorry about the other day.
The pizza got cold.
We are both in the same class.
My family isn't such a big family.
I'm not a member.
You should write home once a month.
Tom watched TV yesterday.
Your cell phone rang a minute ago.
"Here's your tea, Tom."
She's in a green dress.
Tom sat down on the couch.
Hold the handrail.
Please pay the tax.

Who has eaten all the cookies?
I caught a beautiful butterfly.
Let's get together again tomorrow evening.

"As for me, I like this better."
Was the FBI involved?
Both Tom and Mary are vegetarians.
They lost the key to their hotel room.
Tom pretended not to know how to get to Mary's school.
"Would you like a drink? ""I've already got one."""
I think I'm good at driving.
It'll be hard to find a replacement.
I must help her.
When will you be able to finish that job?
The steak was excellent.
The answers are both incorrect.
You work too hard these days. Aren't you tired?
Give me some coffee if there is any left.
When did you start learning French?
My older brother did all the preparation for us.
My older sister's husband is older than me.
Take the trash out.
He sat reading a weekly magazine.
Can it be phrased in another way?
We washed our clothes in the river.
"Before long, the ghost disappeared into a thick fog."
I can't put up with that noise.
I can hear you clearly.
She lay on the bed with her eyes open.
Tom didn't expect to fall in love with Mary.
Tom watches the 6 o'clock news every evening.
Do you know where Tom hid?
My eyes are tired.
She accused him of stealing her car.
Are you studying English?
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
Tom is dealing drugs.
"Oh, don't worry about it."
What do you plan to do this summer?
"If it's possible, I'd like to exchange this for a larger size."
Zip your lip.
"I'm a lucky man, aren't I?"
I want something with which to write.
I woke up with a hangover and didn't feel like going to work.
What was that sound?
Be punctual.
When did you miss your watch?
Do you have any other questions?
Congratulations to the both of you.
I wiped the window sill with a paper towel.
I have more dresses than my sister.
I am full.
Tom wrote about his experience.
You should call on your parents at least once a month.
"It's hard to explain, but I'll try."

She came back just as I was leaving.
I'm sorry. I'm a stranger around here.
Are you in trouble?
He got home at six.
You shouldn't make any noise when you eat soup.
Why do you want to work here?
My father brought me here by car.
Has anything changed?
"It's not that I want a girlfriend, I just want to be in love."
I'll get off at the last stop.
He became irritated.
I tried to fix it.
I don't know how to cook too many things.
He lives off campus.
I may not be in Australia next month.

You look so pale.

Make yourself presentable.
I think Tom has spoken to you about it.
Tom probably can't speak French.
Please tell me your address.
I was awakened at five o'clock.
Don't come into my room.
This museum is worth a visit.
I missed the plane.
"Suddenly, all the lights went out."
This is definitely good.
I hear that his father is in another country.
"Excuse me, how much do these cost?"
This floor is so clean you could eat off of it.
That car is hers.
Do what you like.
I can't for the life of me remember where it was.
We're going to the theater.
I spent a lot of money on my house.

The girls were sitting right next to each other.
I've been there a few times.
They visited me occasionally.
I told Tom that we'd be late.

It was interesting.
What makes you think that Tom likes heavy metal?
That's a great idea.
It's similar to a duck.
Don't make a fuss.
I can't speak English at all.
Tom might cry.
Mary isn't Tom's granddaughter. She's his niece.
"It's going to be cold next weekend, too."
I don't want to drink anything.
I feel refreshed now.
Can I see your passport?
She looks like a teacher.
Of course I'll wait.
Don't eat too much candy.
No fewer than five hundred students were present.
We'll get off at the last station.
Sit on the bench.
I wonder if something interesting will happen.
The dog ran around and around the tree.
The ice cream was neither good nor bad. It was just sweet.
I forgot to call you.
Tom talks a lot.
Tom is married and has kids.
My computer is very slow.
Who's the girl at the door?
The problem was where to set up the tent.
Tom went to Boston in 2013.
I live about an hour from the station.
I was lost.
He looked about.
That isn't a tiger.
She gave me a wonderful present.
He is the greatest singer that ever lived.
I was deeply moved by his speech.
Do you have anything to do tonight?
My daughter is fast asleep.
Tom won the marathon.
"Two teas and a coffee, please."
I really appreciate your kindness.

I was born the year that my grandfather died.
Do as you please.
We have lobsters only on special occasions.
I congratulate you on your success.
Choose one from among these.
There'll be a concert in the park next Sunday.
Nobody can get along with such a person.
What're you talking about?
That house is mine.
I bought a pair of sandals.
He introduced his sister to me.
There are plenty of oranges on the tree.
Appearances are deceptive.
When are you planning to get married?
I was hurt by Tom.

It hurts when I breathe.
"If you hurry, there's a chance you can catch the bus."
Tom had Mary translate the letter into French.
Please copy this page.
He promised that he would write to me once in a while.
Large cars use lots of gas.
What's that about?
He shrugged his shoulders.
"If you find out anything, call me."
Go home. Get some rest.
Tom is a cheapskate.
I don't want to worry my mother.
Get in. I'll drive you home.
Tom liked that idea.
Have you ever seen Tom when he's angry?
I remember seeing you somewhere.
I'll give you just one more chance.
"Tom, if you go, I will, too."
I'm playing video games.
I like to listen to the radio.
I put cream in my coffee.
"Move along, please."
I live in Japan.
I thought that it was something like that.
Seven is a lucky number.
What's so interesting about baseball?
That was a beautiful speech.
Nothing will stop his going.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
Watch your head!
The motive for the murder isn't yet known.
"He was there physically, but not mentally."
I didn't say anything.
Tom works part-time.
Tom did that one time.
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
Choose the one you like.
Second semester has ended.
Tom and I aren't friends. We're just coworkers.
I have three French books.
You must not stay up late.
"Give me a ride on your shoulders, Daddy."
I believe in him.
He talks as though he knew everything.
I believe it'll snow tomorrow.
It was cold and dark.
Tom was taking pictures the whole time.
That's normal here.
Tom didn't want an expensive camera.
I leafed through the book.
Is it that hard?
She is very busy.
I had a hard time making both ends meet.
No one was to be seen in the street.
I have no money with me.
Eating and drinking are prohibited in the library.
It's neither good nor bad.
I narrowly escaped death.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like you."
There is a Picasso on the wall.
I had a terrible experience.

"It's not that I want to have a girlfriend, I just want to be in love."
Tom can't swim.
She wrote a lot of poems.
I owe my success to you.
He will accept any money he can get.
I really liked that house.
I'll go out after having dinner.
Tom is friendly to everyone.
He is accustomed to hard work.
We crossed the river by boat.
I feel slightly better.
She kept on talking.
It is often said that nothing is more precious than time.
I wonder if Tom is a vegetarian.
I want to ask a favor of you.
I cannot afford to buy a car.
Are you going to the party tonight?
I've already talked to the manager.
Let's get takeout.
Tom's house has three rooms.
I'll try to use simple words.
You're disgusting!
Have you heard that a burglar broke into my neighbor's house?
I didn't want to spend any more time cleaning the kitchen floor.
Let me say one thing.
She has five older brothers.
I thought you had to get up by 7:30.
Do you know what he said?
I don't like him.
Would you like more wine?
That's not a big problem.
Tom soaked in the bathtub.
Tom has left.
This cake is really delicious.
I was mistaken for a salesman.
There is a threat of a storm.
Thank you for your help.
This will be a walk in the park.
Why does Tom need that?
I have a feeling I've been here before.
Let me try again.
Televisions use more electricity than you might expect.
I'll come to your place.
What's the matter?
The tea is boiling hot.
The rumor's all over town.
This is reasonable.
Tom got on the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor.
I'm worried that I'll make a mistake.
We love each other.
He played the piano and she sang.
The website is visited over 30 million times a day.
I have to think about what needs to be done.
My older brother lives in a small village.
The girl who works at the bakery is pretty.
Could you lend me $300?
Ugh! I lost my phone again.
I have a dim memory of my grandmother.
Let's take a break for coffee.
Teamwork is important in soccer.
"Go to sleep, Tom. You need to wake up early tomorrow morning."
"I'm sorry, but I'm going home."
Tom went for a swim.
You'll have to wait.
I wonder how Tom escaped.
Tom wondered if it would be difficult to find a job in Boston.
Fruits have seeds in them.
I'm Tom's coach.
What vintage is this wine?
You hit the nail on the head.
Do you think that my way of teaching is wrong?
The question is when to start.
I'm busy getting ready for tomorrow.
Tom maxed out his credit card.
Let's get going.
"Mary doesn't eat pork, does she?"
I didn't consider the subject seriously.
It's obsolete.
I can't see either of them.
She glanced shyly at the young man.
The towel on the left is yours.
I've got to see a dentist.
He outdoes me in every subject.
When's the wedding?
I'm sorry for the delay in my reply.
I can't think of life without you.
Where is the police station?
The plane flew over the island.
Do you know who this car belongs to?
Don't confuse Austria with Australia.
Would you believe me if I told you I love you?
Are you thirsty?
It's not easy to keep up with the times.
She's gentle with children.
I'd like you to translate this report into French.
Mary is staying up late this week to prepare for her finals.
New Year's Day is close at hand.
You need to read between the lines.
I found the box empty.
I slept well last night.
Is there no alternative to your method?
He is on leave.
Tom will do anything for money.
What time can you come?
That was three days ago.
Are you still living in Boston?
It is very kind of you to invite me.
I'm waiting for this store to open.
School begins at 8:30 a.m.
This isn't a poisonous snake.
This is it.
Tom gave the manila envelope to Mary.
She will be seventeen years old next February.
Stay away from the fire.
"To tell the truth, we got married last year."
I believe Tom is right.
Thank you ever so much.
How did you come to know each other?
Mt. Fuji could be seen in the distance.
Is that pencil Tom's?
Perhaps it will rain tomorrow.
Kindly refrain from smoking.
Look out! There's a car coming.
Just tell me what you know about the situation.
Could you carry my bags for me?
That's a novel idea.
How do you like your beef stew?
Thank you for the present you gave my son.
Tom and Mary have different tastes.
Someone caught me by the arm.
Are you guys hungry?
I don't think that Tom is selfish.
I met him at a club.
Almost every student failed the exam.
There's no need to reply to that letter.
Tom often loses things.
"You're still mad, aren't you?"
I saw a friend.
Pay your fare here.
I fell asleep on the sofa today.
I have a big family.
I thought you wouldn't come.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow. I'm going to take it easy.
I really have to go to bed.
I don't know why Tom did that.
He has to work on his own.
I like this.
There is only a marginal difference between the two.
I appreciate your candor.
"If you follow this street, you will get to the station."
"Someone stabbed Tom with an ice pick, but he's OK now."
You're really a hard worker.
The vacation is over now.
It looks like Tom is bad at multiplication.
You'd better hold your tongue.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Why did you buy travel insurance?
We won't leave without Tom.
I don't remember a thing.
I love this book.
Tom's dog barks a lot.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
Don't fight.
How old are your children?
What time do you close?
I want to go to the same school that Tom plans to go to.
A tall building was built next to my house.
Have you ever eaten at the restaurant where Tom works?
I have nothing more to do today.
These earphones don't work.
I left an umbrella behind.
Tom seems absorbed in his work.
There were a crowd of people in the park.
I go overseas a lot.
What were you doing together?
Our vacation will soon come to an end.
How did you get them?
We believe in God.
What time do you get up every day?
He that will steal an egg will steal an ox.
There's no knowing what'll happen.
Tom can swim well.
Do you want a snack?
Are you satisfied?
Some people are working in the fields.
I thrust my hand into my pocket.
I promise I'll come back.
I'll be back within two hours.
"Some of them are healthy, but others are not."
Either day is fine.
I didn't have time to watch TV yesterday.
Mary has beautiful brown eyes.
It might be better to leave today.
I wish I hadn't gotten married.
I didn't think Boston would be this hot.
Tom and Mary survived.
I sat down in the shade of a tree and read the book.
Is it time?
He repairs his own car.
Dinner is ready!
Please remain standing.
The Rhine runs between France and Germany.
I'm counting on you to be strong.
"Champagne, please."
It's the highest building in this city.
I catch a cold every year.
I need an envelope and a piece of paper. I also need either a pencil or a pen.
Don't ask me to choose between you and my children.
She turned her eyes away.
Both of those students didn't pass the test.
I feel a bit depressed.
I gave him a few books.
Please don't drink from the bottle.
I'm all for it.
Do you accept Visa?
I once worked in a restaurant.
Tom may come at any time.
Don't you have an audition today?
There is a lot of furniture in this room.
How did you two become acquainted?
When was the last time you had a shower?
The air conditioner is broken.
I make it a rule not to stay up late.
Is that my hat?
It seems Tom knows that Mary did that.
I am right for once.
"Is there a book in the desk? ""No, there isn't."""
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
We took advantage of the fine weather to play tennis.
Why do you hate him so much?
That's why I want to talk to Tom.
I think spiders are cute.
She is not afraid of anything.
Let's go out and sing karaoke.
I crossed the river by boat.
I didn't like beer the first time that I tried it.
He devoted his life to the study of science.
I bought a house.
Tom cracked open the window.
How did you get here?
That's a lovely necklace.
Do you have a course for beginners?
Tom's grinning.
Make yourself at home.
I'm used to being laughed at.
"During my early teens, I wasn't always on the best of terms with my parents."
Smoking is forbidden in this area.
Who's she?
I bought this camera yesterday.
This song is familiar to me.
Can your mother drive a car?
That's too bad.
Tom and Mary said they liked swimming.
Who is your friend?
Are you going to the movies tonight?
Salt helps to preserve food from decay.
Share this with your friends.
He demanded payment of the debt.
"According to her, he isn't coming."
Tom knows what's really going on.
It rained for three days on end.
Look at the top of that tree.
I don't think many people can say they're satisfied with their salary.
Let's go to a concert together.
What grade is your sister in?
Let's take a rest.
I don't want there to be any trouble.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
He gets a high salary.
"A young boy, who couldn't have been more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office."
What an idiot I am!
Never come back here again.
Would you like to have a drink with us?
You didn't need to hurry.
Millions of people all over the world knew about Rev. Martin Luther King and his beliefs.
"Two glasses of apple juice, please."
Can you decode it?
What's the name of your pharmacy?
Mind your own business.
I need a bucket.
"She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are."
I feel like eating out tonight.
I ride my bike to work.
I also know a thing or two about cooking.
The pain will eventually go away.
We have less than thirty minutes to go.
Tom passed his French examination.
Did she go to the concert last Sunday?
How big is this park?
3 multiplied by 5 is 15.
Tom is smart.
The door of the office is yellow.
Belgium is not as large as France.
We met in Boston.
Tom put ketchup on his french fries.
I'd like to have a few minutes alone with Tom.
How's your mother?
Everyone was calm.
Get out of bed!
I have a persistent cough.
I'm not going if Tom is.
I had a headache last night.
When did you write this book?
Tom opened his suitcase.
Tom lives in a small village.
This is the very best method.
I'd like to rent skis and ski boots.
I'll do my best to ensure that such mistakes don't occur in the future.
It is likely to rain tomorrow.
Is French a difficult language to learn?
I won't be home in the afternoon.
Mix about four cups of white flour with a pinch of salt.
This is a picture of the ship that Tom and I were on.
Is he sleeping?
Just take my word for it.
I don't think that we can do that.
Give me back my pants.
"Both of you are musicians, aren't you?"
Let's go home.
Italian pasta is delicious.
Where are you going to go on your vacation?
Was anybody else absent?
I wholeheartedly agree.
All that you have to do is to follow his advice.
Tom was drunk and he said some things he shouldn't have.
There has been a good apple harvest this year.
I gave money to everyone.
This custom is unique to America.
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
I think I'll give Tom an egg timer.
Did you take a bath?
Tom is a very reliable guy.
Why would Tom have done that?
Turn left at the corner.
There's no room for doubt.
It's too much for one person.
"Next time you see her, give her my best wishes."
I'm a light sleeper.
I apologize for being late.
I've been playing football since I was thirteen.
Tom's loud snoring kept me awake all night.
You should tell him the truth.
What? I can't believe it!
Soccer is the most popular sport in Brazil.
That's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
What is the area of this house?
Tom is an arrogant jerk.
Where is Tom from?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand French.
Please put the chair away. It is in the way.
My father isn't at home.
We've got to catch the lion alive.
How is it going?
I am a professor.
Please come inside.
What happened between you and Tom?
"If I have time, I'll drop by."
I've never climbed Mt. Fuji.
Thank you all so much for understanding.
I remember seeing you last year.
I'm waiting for my turn.
This is my favorite color.
Switzerland is famous for its scenic beauty.
Tom's mother lives in this village.
This work is so simple that even a child can do it.
He's a bit shy.
I've already told Tom I plan on staying in Boston for another three weeks.
Where do babies come from?
How's it going at school?
The local train is less comfortable than the express train.
Don't bother to call me.
Which bicycle is yours?
How would you like to pay?
Tom couldn't answer all the questions.
I live on the bottom floor.
Quite a few people have two cars.
She's always trying to help other people.
Yesterday Mary smiled at me.
Where do you usually buy your clothes?
Tom took a pair of scissors out of the drawer.
"Let me alone, she said angrily."
The clock has already struck noon.
The glass shattered into pieces.
I know those girls over there quite well.
This is the key I've been looking for.
What're you watching?
Have you seen any movies lately?
Where are the toilets?
I just can't remember her name.
The station is pretty far.
"You know I'm still planning on joining the team, don't you?"
"Good morning, everyone."
I've heard Tom has dropped out of college.
I know the man who lives downstairs.
"A few years ago, on Mother's Day, I gave my stepmother a locket as a present."
I can't drink milk.
Show me today's paper.
Is this the first time you've traveled alone?
Don't forget to take your medicine.
I like climbing mountains.
"Help me with my homework, please."
It started to snow.
Let's go to a movie.
Tom should've discussed it with his parents.
My job search is really going rough. I don't have any connections.
Please let me get back to you.
The car broke down on the way to the airport.
"For one thing, I don't have any money. For another, I don't have the time."
May I ask you a totally unrelated question?
I wonder if Tom knows that we don't eat meat.
I like chocolate.
I'm freezing to death. Close that window.
There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
You'd better get some sleep.
I am afraid you have the wrong number.
I hope you'll like it.
I don't like being on a diet.
I sat by his side.
I don't feel like going out this morning.
Tom sketched a picture of an elephant for Mary.
Cats don't like to get wet.
The food is good.
I love comedies.
I have an opinion.
That seems perfectly reasonable.
My mother is always finding fault with me.
What a beautiful garden!
I'm really hungry.
Tom isn't in the office.
Tom helped Mary get dressed.
"Among the five of us, she, without a doubt, speaks the most languages."
He insisted.
Why is Tom in such high spirits today?
It's a little cold today.
You should pay more attention to what you say.
I'm going to ask Mary to marry me.
Mary is Tom's common-law wife.
I need a cup of coffee.
You have no right to take it away from Tom.
Our company's base is in Tokyo.
Tom often catches colds.
Open the door.
I'll be there soon.
He never tells lies.
Is Tom your type?
It started raining as soon as Tom got home.
I believe that you'll succeed.
Do you know her?
"My father does play golf, but he's not very good at it."
Take the garbage out.
There isn't much traffic on this road.
We're in agreement.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
I'll try to repair it.
Where do you live?
They say that Venice is a beautiful city.
I really need your help.
Are there enough chairs to seat 12 people?
How was your exam?
His hands were empty.
She looks better in Japanese clothes.
Sales fell off in the third quarter.
Did you order this?
"You have a part-time job, right?"
It's too soon to tell.
I'll peel an orange for you.
We're still open.
An Englishman would not use such a word.
I must have caught a cold.
Tom often drinks green tea.
The dam burst owing to the heavy rain.
There were none in the room.
That factory manufactures toys.
It is a little cold.
It was very cheap.
Her beauty was beyond description.
Do you have to go there every day?
It's the shortest route to Boston.
Money does not grow on trees.
Oh no! I forgot my camera.
Is that French?
She taught him how to play the piano.
How much does a can of beer cost?
"Tom can speak a little French, but he's not fluent."
Tom took the children to school.
This is a picture of Tom's dog.
There is no place like home.
The universe is infinite.
I'd like you to send this package for me right away.
Will Tom change his mind?
I like my meat well done.
Tom helped me write this essay.
He is playing here.
There's nothing left in the refrigerator.
Do your best in everything.
I think that it's true.
The dictionary on the desk is mine.
Are you teachers?
Be careful what you eat.
Speak louder so everyone can hear you.
Tom hasn't closed the windows yet.
Sales have dropped off at every big department store.
He is in a poor state of health.
My uncle has made me what I am.
This building is near completion.
Please throw me the ball.
I am too short.
Last night I was at home.
There are a lot of things I have to do.
Where is the tourist information office?
I want to become a singer.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
I bought two tickets for a concert.
This is the very CD I've been looking for.
"OK, you win."
Was Tom with anyone at the time?
I'll put this in the fridge.
I baked some apple pies.
The tragedy must be remembered so that it isn't repeated.
Could you help me wash the dishes?
Keep to the right.
Is there anywhere I can go to find a flea market?
Part of the roof fell off.
Nobody is too old to learn.
"Of the three boys, the youngest is the most attractive."
Tom has a high opinion of himself.
Let's eat sushi.
He called her bad names.
I'd rather stay at home than go fishing.
I will start working on July first.
Tom runs 10 kilometers a day.
That's a lot of pressure.
Tom has already finished breakfast.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to use me as a hostage.
He is ashamed of his failure.
I'm here.
Only Tom would have the guts to do that kind of thing.
"You don't understand it, do you?"
Tell me where it hurts.
"He was able to cook himself dinner, after a fashion."
Copenhagen is a bike-friendly city.
Could I borrow a hammer?
I think you're right.
I've seen it somewhere before.
Tom didn't text Mary back.
I will do anything I can do for her.
We live in a big city.
I like curry rice.
Do you regret marrying me?
"You'd better take your umbrella, just in case it rains."
About how many days will it take to get there?
Study in the cool of the morning.
My hands are wet.
Where's my piggy bank?
What's your diagnosis?
My father doesn't really talk much.
"I'd like some wine, please."
Don't point at others.
"She went into the kitchen to see who was there, but there was nobody there."
That nickname fits him perfectly.
"Small and ""tiny"" are adjectives."
"Today at 8:10 a.m., Mary gave birth to healthy triplets."
There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of you.
Were you listening to the radio yesterday?
"To tell the truth, I'd rather stay home than go out."
Where would you like me to put this?
Tom blew a fuse.
My father is busy just now.
Enjoy yourself.
Hurry up or you'll miss the train.
Do you know the words to this song?
I'd rather stay at home than go out.
Are you hungry already? You should've eaten more for lunch.
"Long story short, I was fired."
Japan's population is shrinking.
Tom is probably asleep.
Does Tom like cycling?
My daughter is to get married in June.
I don't usually drink so much.
Could you please tell me which way I should go?
I thought that we could be friends.
I wonder what changed Tom's mind.
I'm going shopping.
He was looking forward to that evening's date.
I like you a lot.
He received a lot of praise.
"To tell the truth, I didn't go there."
I'll be back at half past six.
"Oh, really?"
He was unable to completely give up on his hopes of marrying her.
Tom suggested we leave before it got dark.
Will you drive me home?
Tom said Mary has been having fun doing that.
Leave my brother alone.
Where is her house?
"In 1853, Perry asked Japan to open the door to America."
You should've phoned me.
Tom was never able to tell Mary that he loved her.
Would you like to have pizza for lunch today?
Yesterday I was sick.
"Hey kid, get in line like everyone else."
Was anybody else absent?
It was cold.
I'm a lot younger than Tom.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
Could you do me a favor? Will you lend me some money?
He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
I heard it from Tom.
I'd prefer to not take that risk.
I'm afraid it'll be a rainy day tomorrow.
He was standing with his hands in his pockets.
Who wrote you this letter?
Did you get burned?
It was easy to fix.
Let me take your blood pressure.
My hobby is writing stories.
I like the gray sweater more than the purple one.
Let's enjoy the long vacation.
Tom often fails to keep his word.
You'll have to study harder next year.
They love each other.
Is your headache gone?
Tom is reading a long novel.
Stop it.
Mary prided herself on her beauty.
Tom kissed Mary on the lips.
Give yourself plenty of time.
The cat is adorable.
Tom is finally safe.
I still love Tom.
Did you order something?
Tom always thinks he's right.
"Two glasses of orange juice, please."
Did you just call me fat?
What are you laughing at?
The train was crowded with people.
Tomorrow I'll go to his house to pick him up.
Why is Tom angry?
Who left the window open?
"Great weather, isn't it?"
Do you know where Tom is going?
Do you remember the night when we first met?
Tom lost his memory.
This is food.
Lightning hit that tower.
"You've never had a boyfriend, have you?"
There's a good chance that he'll be elected.
Now isn't the time to be showing off.
We finally reached the top of the mountain.
I had never seen so much money.
We need a large amount of money for this project.
Do you know any restaurants with good Korean food?
Where can I get a taxi?
"Which do you like better, spring or fall?"

She has a kind heart.
I'm a little bit hungry.

Is there room for another person?
I have the same dictionary as your brother.
Just help me.
There are many postcards in this store.
I've caught a cold.
The ice has melted.
Help me wash the car.
I want to see it for myself.
Put away your bicycle.
We should keep our promise.
I have been studying English for three years.
I think Tom could do that.
Raise both of your arms up like this.
Thanks very much.
Please light a candle.
Tom was smiling.
Let's do this first of all.
It was very hot inside the bus.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have a green shirt.
The restaurant was empty.
We ate the smoked salmon.
She is afraid of her own shadow.
I have to study French today.
I was very happy to hear the news.
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
He must have missed the train.
"I paid 2,000 yen for the parcel to be sent by air."
I've already told the police what happened.
I've got a bit of an ache in my back.
You're always anticipating trouble.
I don't think Tom was thirsty.
I don't have time to eat right now.
I never dreamed that I would win first prize.
The people of this village live in harmony with nature.
Let go of my arm! I can't stand people touching me.
"You don't live around here, do you?"
There's still some room in the closet.
Can you make sashimi out of this fish I just caught?
I am sixteen years old.
The general decided to launch an offensive against the enemy camp.
Was that too easy?
Who decided that?
"Come on, spit it out!"
I've not been to work. I've stayed at home all day.
There is no hope of success.
Oil floats on water.
I think the museum is closed on Mondays.
Which CD do you want to listen to?
May I have your name?
Where did you go for that 30 minutes you were gone?
He doesn't have any friends to play with.
Hop in.
Italy isn't Greece.
This CD belongs to my son.
She complained about my low salary.
I saw Tom getting into Mary's car.
Is this your cat?
The moon emerged from behind the cloud.
"He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't."
I think this is amazing.
I wish you'd asked me sooner.
Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for you.
She always looks pale.
Tom has a good sense of fashion.
It's freezing.
I'll give you any of them except this one.
Please go around to the side of the house.
We expect good results.
These shoes are too small for me.
How's the work going?
A crowd gathered at the scene.
This is a lance.
I enjoyed the concert except that the hall was cold.
Have you installed any antivirus software?
I can understand you to some extent.
Where can we make a phone call?
Did Tom cry?
Give that to me.
He has already gone home.
"After two days, there was no food left."
Take off your wet clothes and change into something dry.
"Which do you like better, meat or fish?"
I haven't seen you for a long time.
"Which do you like better, dogs or cats?"
I heard an unusual noise.
I want to be an honest person.
You should consult your doctor.
Tom is kind of strange.
Do you have a calendar?
"She speaks not only German and French, but English as well."
You didn't say the magic word.
What do you have in your pockets?
You look relieved.
I have to learn French.
We've got something for you.
Which side won?
You can relax.
How's your cold?
"This is too easy, I guess."
I was late for work because I forgot to set my alarm.
"Watch your step, or else you will trip on the baggage."
What would you do in a situation like this?
It took him a moment to realize where he was after he came to.
The police are looking for the robber.
When did you buy that watch?
I won't tell you.
I hope that you will get well soon.
The concert lasted about three hours.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
I'm halfway through this detective story.
I thought I asked you to clean the living room.
The concert was successful.
Wait just a moment.
I used to play in that park when I was a kid.
What kind of books do you want to read this year?
Why don't we get married?
Some animals are active at night.
Are you really knitting Tom a sweater?

Does Tom know about that?
I remember the first time I saw Tom.
Are you sure Tom is here?
I'll be back in a jiffy.
I'm looking for someone who can speak Portuguese.
Tom found the letters that Mary had hidden.
He went into teaching.
Two thirds of the employees of this company are engineers.
I'll take you there.
My younger brother and I live in the same apartment.
I agreed to help him in his work.
Tom kicked the ball.
I wonder whether Tom is really happy.
Please take care of yourself.
I don't like any of them.
Is there anybody in the room?
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
Tom can play piano very well.
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
Let me check my schedule.
I have nothing to say about it.
He hit on the plan after long meditation.
"With the exception of Tom, nobody else came to the party."
Where's your grandson?
I had a wonderful time.
That job is impossible for me to do.
It's a famous song.
"It's cold, so I want to eat something hot."
They laugh at him behind his back.
He shouted at the top of his voice.
Many cities were destroyed by bombs.
I warned him about the danger.
Tom seemed conceited.
These flowers are pretty.
I've only been to Boston one time.
The cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
Tom is a systems engineer.
I don't know the reason he is absent today.
Do I have to do it over again?
I broke the clutch.
Tom left a gift for you.
I don't eat oysters.
This isn't your fault.
I ran away.
Your temperature's normal.
Is there an English-Japanese dictionary on the bookshelf?
It's already late.
"Whatever happens, I'll be there for you."
Is it just me?
I remember him well.
I've been to Australia three times.
That's really cool.
We need to talk about this.
"It's late, so I'm going home."
They're trying to organize a new political party.
"When Tom was thirteen, he ran away from home."
I just bought myself a new jacket.
I slept late and I missed the first train.
Let's play baseball.
Is she still angry?
An olive branch symbolizes peace.
The dog bit my hand.
Are you still living in the same place?
"Great, isn't it?"
Is this your first visit here?
Oxygen is needed for combustion.
The outside of the castle was painted white.
Turn it off.
I'd like to stay here tonight.
Tom is a sweet person.
My mother bought a refrigerator and had it delivered.
He shook his head back and forth.
How often do you eat pudding?
Orchids demand daily care.
I like white roses more than red ones.
May I eat this?
Tom was inattentive in class.
Last month's gas bill was really high.
Is this your daughter?
I wrote down that telephone number.
Is Tom a Christian?
You've got a good head on your shoulders.
I think we'll stay here.
What sort of a person is Tom?
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
You can also eat it raw.
This dictionary isn't very good.
He drank a glass of red wine.
I know you're hiding behind the curtain.
I've just finished eating breakfast.
She doesn't have a lazy bone in her body.
You're driving too fast.
"Ticket, please."
The smog was bad today.
Could you please delete this photo?
Hunger is the best sauce.
Tom has been dating Mary for about three years.
The laborers formed a human barricade.
Tom has almost no accent.
I'd like one more blanket.
Playing tennis is a lot of fun.
My nose started to itch.
Tom knows it's Mary's birthday today.
I agreed with his plan.
It wasn't Tom who gave Mary that necklace.
Tom can't stand the sight of blood.
He's accustomed to mountain climbing.
The director is sensitive to criticism.
He made up for the deficit.
"Do you have anything to do? ""Nothing in particular."""
I can't get along with the neighbors any more.
You probably eat genetically modified fruits and vegetables all the time without knowing it.
She runs faster than I do.
He did nothing but cry.
"You ate sushi yesterday, didn't you?"
Banks open at nine o'clock.
You've been taken off the list.
"If you make your own clothes, it will save you money."
He was frozen to death.
It was fate.
I like playing tennis and golf.
She loves to fish.
Yesterday was scorching hot.
This is a minor injury.
Tom felt relieved.
This book has now been translated into French.
"In Japan, we drive on the left side of the road."
Tom is a zookeeper.
Is it OK if I ask you a few medical questions?
Please call me tonight at my office.
What's cooking in the kitchen?
Tom killed everyone in the classroom.
He turned pale when he heard that news.
We might never see each other again.
You'd better not go there.
He loves her.
I can't remember.
They approached the tourists and asked them for money.
If I don't go now my boss is going to fire me.
I'm not dead.
Check again in about three minutes.
Tom talks about Mary a lot.
Tom's wasting time.
"So far, there haven't been any problems."
I can't do it by myself.
I don't have any change.
Do you remember what you said?
Is Tom good-looking?
He worked all day yesterday.
Congratulations!
I slept on my stomach.
"The package had a sticker on it that said ""Handle with care""."
It's not clear when he came here.
I think I should do it for you.
Did you forget to bring money?
His car is similar to mine.
That's all our money.
Tom ate his fill.
It's been hot and humid.
"If you agree to buy 3,000 of them, we'll give you a 3 percent discount."
He can't read it.
I skipped the introduction.
He has a lot more money than I have.
I haven't received any notice that she's coming.
What are you so afraid of?
Never have I seen such a beautiful rainbow.
This is an emergency.
What's the admission charge?
Press Enter.
Tom and Mary took a long walk through the countryside.
I don't want to eat that.
These are our books.
I was bitten by a mosquito.
It doesn't matter.
It's quite humid.
Tom's dream has finally come true.
It would be better if you stayed here a little longer.
Remove the chicken's giblets before cooking.
Is that love?
That would be difficult.
I didn't ask you to marry me.
I'll slap the living daylights out of you!
I was scolded by the teacher for being late.
She's my type.
We will have to consider each application on a case-by-case basis.
My mother objects to smoking.
Water is important for humans.
There are many factors.
I found it rather difficult to make myself understood.
"It's not true, is it?"
His wife nags him constantly.
Let's go to the picnic.
What are your favorite spices?
I don't blame you for putting off our trip.
Is that a riddle?
How do you know that light travels faster than sound?
I can't believe that it's been more than a year.
I've had a lot to eat today.
Anybody knows it.
I went to the supermarket.
Tom hid under the table.
Many people were left homeless as a result of the earthquake.
My father passed away two years ago.
I live near a dam.
I have to cook dinner today.
Tell me how to do it.
The war broke out in 1939.
"For now, let's sit here."
He set out for Tokyo.
That's a problem.
She is absent because of sickness.
It snowed yesterday.
Her eyes are blue.
The bug is still alive.
Tom can't explain the difference between cheap wine and expensive wine.
Spring is coming.
I want to be an honest person.
I like you a whole lot.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
Tom went for a walk and took pictures of things he saw.
I want some paper.
"As far as I know, he's guilty."
He wrote a novel based on ancient myths.
Will you help me with this?
Let's take a walk in the park.
I don't feel well.
Would you let me think about it for a while?
I've got one brother and two sisters.
Tom looked like he was in his late thirties.
This is the cheapest store in town.
This clock is broken.
"If you don't want to talk about it, that's OK."
I haven't had lunch yet.
It'll be summer vacation soon.
What makes you say that?
My girlfriend is older than me.
I think that Tom is thirty years old.
You had better make sure that he is at home before you call on him.
Did you see my younger brother?
The storm rattled the shutters.
I'd do anything for you.
The boy peered into the room.
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
Tom was shot by a policeman.
I don't like to go outside when it's raining.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
I've been wanting to go there for a long time.
Tom came out of his bedroom wearing pajamas and fluffy slippers.
The phone was out of order again.
We worked all night.
"May I see that blouse, please?"
"Hey, watch your mouth."
Family's more important than work to me.
I have lost my pencil.
I've decided to quit drinking.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
My wallet's been stolen.
You have to stay quiet.
It seems that she's happy.
This is my baby.
She works for French intelligence.
What do you usually do after dinner?
I got dumped.
I spent the morning writing letters.
"If you want a pencil, I'll lend you one."
I'm going to make you happy.
Is Tom Canadian?
You should've worked harder.
Just a second. Let me finish.
What do you have in your fridge?
"The Democrats haven't decided on their candidates yet, but in any case they're sure to lose."
I didn't expect that question.
The house is under repairs.
The pond is full of tadpoles.
I hate it when I work late and end up missing an episode of a show I'm following.
Tom reeked of alcohol.
What in the world are you doing?
What's Tom like?
I think he's a competent person.
I've just been to the bank.
This is no laughing matter.
I appreciate everything you've done for me.
You promised me.
"Goodnight, I'll see you in the morning."
They criticized me for coming late.
Tom makes up stories all the time.
Do you know Tom well?
Is Tom Jackson a patient here?
That's a wolf.
Come here.
"I can swim, but I don't like to."
Tom left about thirty minutes ago.
I gave Tom a key to my apartment.
"Just stand there, please."
They want to know what your plan is.
"I was hungry, so I ate lunch at about 11 o'clock."
You can save your breath. There is no use talking to him.
I drank the coffee.
You're right.
Can I go?
I'm not interested in tea ceremony or flower arranging.
Now I'm done for.
I took Tom's temperature.
My father bought a new car.
That's the spirit.
I'm not stupid enough to climb a mountain in the winter without first making adequate preparations.
Tom and Mary were married in October of 2013.
Tom didn't trust Mary and she didn't trust him.

Am I OK?
Today is Monday.
We lost.

When did you become a teacher?
Will you be home tonight?
Did anybody get injured?
Don't speak to him like that.
I'll be glad to help you.
Tom and Mary are playing together.
It was under your bed.
This is a painting.
I was hurt.
She didn't like living in the city.
Translate these sentences into French.
It's probably my fault.
I just dropped in.
It's the sort of work that calls for a high level of concentration.
The war is still going on.
This is all I know.
Please excuse me for coming late.
That just doesn't make sense to me.
I can't put up with her any longer.
Both of the windows were broken.
What have you come here for?
We had a heavy rain yesterday.

You should arrive at school before nine.

I'm not very good with chopsticks.
What other options are there?

Don't wake him up.

Don't be mean.
I'm not saying that it's not possible.
We overslept.
She was scared at the sight of the dead body.
No one could solve the problem.
I'll see you next month.
"Tom is a liar, isn't he?"
I want to see the world through your eyes.
Don't you think it a bad thing?
"What's wrong? ""The speakers aren't working well."""
Are you listening?
Tom might know something.
That's a good idea!
He opened a newspaper and covered the dead child.
My grandmother made me a new dress.
Your friend told me about it.
Tom played the part of Hamlet.
"You are a friend of Tom's, aren't you?"
I'll take a nap after lunch.
I can't give up smoking.
She was kind enough to come pick me up at my house.
Will it rain today?
Tom was on the bus with Mary.
Cats like to sunbathe.
I'm trying to remember.
Tom will be home until noon.
Nobody knows why.
How would you answer this question?
It's just too risky.
The party was a great success.
The climate here doesn't agree with me.
May I ask who's calling?
Would you like meat or fish?
Tom is a little younger than Mary.
Is this edible?

A horse runs quickly.
Don't you worry about Tom?
You have to take the good with the bad.
My mother happened to be there when the fire broke out.

Now step aside.
He interpreted for me.

This book is too difficult for me.
Do you have a hernia?
It rained three times during the trip.
Listen.
Repeat what I've just told you.
We arrived after midnight.
The air conditioner doesn't work.
This is a good opportunity to get to know one another.
How do you spell your name?
I don't even have a single girlfriend.
I got a taxi in front of the station.
We've had all kinds of weather over the past few days.
Do what you think is right.
Let's come up with a new plan.
He cried out in pain.
I thought that you said that you were afraid to do that.
One is never too old to learn.
I've already told Tom I plan on staying in Boston for three more weeks.
Tom is coming back.
Tom really cares about you.
Does he have any brothers?
The dog hid under the bed whenever lightning flashed.
I like this house. It's quite roomy.
How much does it cost to make a one yen coin?
Is this fish still alive?
I'm sorry to have troubled you.
There are plenty of fish in this river.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
This medicine is still not sold in pharmacies.
French isn't easy.
I think I'll go.
Let's get going.
She gave me a bag made of leather.
She stabbed him in the back.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
I plucked a daisy for her.
Tom is Mary's imaginary friend.
I guess we're even now.
I don't mind anymore.
I will stay here all this month.

I need to know what the problem was.

"Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can."
Not far from the house was a military hospital.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Remember to lock the door.
I'll ask Tom.
"Before buying shoes, you should try them on."
Are these the glasses you were looking for?
I'm going on a picnic tomorrow.
I hear that he's still alive.
Dogs have a keen sense of smell.
"I think Tom is from Australia, but I may be wrong."
He often drives his father's car.
I saw him at the station a few days ago.
I can't find my house keys.
When will the bus be here?
Tom likes Mary's younger sister more than he likes Mary.
I can do anything.
I'm off this week.
How did you like the party?
I already speak French.
It sounds good.
Monday was a horrible day.
I think about him all the time.
You can get to her house in a variety of different ways.
We're in a hurry.

You have to eat that.
She advised me which I should buy.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
Mary always studies for two hours a day.
Do you want to go out for coffee?
Do you know the rules of the game?
We'll go to the library and the bookstore.
It's time to go home.
He accomplished the work as planned.
Is there a room available for tonight?
Tom ate my cookies.
Today isn't really convenient for me.
I came here yesterday.
I visited my father's grave.
You should go right away.
Tom and Mary are in the next room with John.
The yen is rising and the dollar is falling.
He is capable of teaching French.
"From now on, I'm going to say what's on my mind."
What if nothing happens?
This hat doesn't fit me.
"Compare the two carefully, and you will see the difference."
Tom's serious.
This is just between you and me.
"Here, please have a seat."
Is everybody OK?
Being with you makes me happy.
Say when.
Tom is at work.
Tom was too angry to speak.
She told her son to behave himself at home.
You can get a car license after you turn eighteen.
Tom has a short temper.
Could you please tell me the way?

I'm good at singing.
You should do that soon.
He is very honest.
The prince was changed into a tree by magic.
I'm all ears.
When are you going to get up?
There are more people here than usual today.

You can't miss it.
The rain set our plans back two weeks.
The cat drank milk.
We should decide today.
I'd like to see the doctor.
We had a cool summer this year.
Are you still planning to buy a car?
I didn't expect that Tom would fall in love with Mary.
Many people think that children spend too much time watching television.
I've got a feeling that Tom won't graduate this year.
He is not a teacher but a student.
I asked her to wait a minute.
Tom grabbed Mary's arm and pulled her towards the door.
Is it foggy?
You can take your time.
You should've come a little earlier.
I don't eat as much as you do.
"If it hadn't rained so hard, the game wouldn't have been canceled."
Do you want to eat?

I'll give you a prescription.
Read this.

Where have you been?
I just wish we could leave this horrible place.

Did Tom eat anything else?
The room is rather small.
He stuck his knife into the tree.
Does she have a piano?
I wrote this book.
I am dead tired.
He got his chance to succeed.
Who did you go skating with?
It makes my mouth water.
Thanks very much.
Here comes the train!
I'm glad that Tom and I go to the same school.
Shall I clean the room?
When does fishing season start?
He is very sociable.
The jacket is big on me.
Please fasten your seat belt.
Tom never stops talking.
My father is in the hospital now.
"This time, I think you're right."
He turned the doorknob with his left hand.
You don't have to answer today.
Leave me alone!
This is not my ticket.
I fell in love with her.

A sleeping child looks like an angel.
Please come the day after tomorrow.
That meeting was a waste of time.
"In order to get to know a person, one merely needs to travel with them for a week."
I wish I had been there with you.
I need a bag. Will you lend me one?
We don't need to attend that meeting.
I found the keys that I'd lost.
I was with them for an hour.
Tom is only thirty minutes away.
Is there a zoo in Boston?
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework.
It isn't worth discussing.
Tom told me Mary was shy.
"When I awoke this morning, I felt hungry."
I'm not used to the work.
Is there a telephone anywhere?
The guards change every three hours.
Get in touch with your parents immediately.
I could scarcely stand on my feet.
"It's a very dangerous sport, where a slight mistake can lead to serious injury."
Tom went for a stroll.
Is there a mailbox near here?
This bus will take you around the city.
It's already time to go home.
"Can you give me your telephone number, please?"
Today I'm working from home.
That must've been interesting work.
I wanted to buy some chocolate.
I'll lend this dictionary to you.
This smells like cheese.
Input your name.
I have to get up early every day this week.
Tom injured his foot in a soccer game.
That baby does nothing but cry.
The construction blocked the entrance to the street.
Tom just stood there watching everybody dance.
I don't like your coming late every day.
You're crazy.
She can sing very well.
Did you have a good trip?
The girl was sobbing in the corner of the schoolroom.
Don't tell Tom.
You're cute.
"I am against the war, of course."
We provided the flood victims with food and clothing.
We must allow for some delays.
I'll get off at the next station.
Please copy the first and second pages.
There isn't a drop of water left.
Please turn off the light before you go to bed.
Roll up your sleeves.
My father is out.
You may as well go home now.
Goggles protect your eyes from dust.
Tom sat down at the desk.
He can't write any kanji.
There is a flower on the table.
He's getting cold feet.
I would like some wine.
I wonder if Tom is really going deaf.
His advice to us was that we should play fair.
Did you call him up yesterday?
Tom has lost his motivation to work.
I usually wake up at 6.
Wait till 2:30.
Is your mom at home?
Where is my watch?
I always buy fresh vegetables instead of frozen ones.
Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
I need to buy some paint brushes.
I must have lost it.
He blamed others for his own failure.
"Lately, we see crows everywhere."
He speaks ten languages.
I want to do it myself.
Let's send Tom a Christmas card this year.
He never takes any notice of what his father says.
I think it's the best way.
My father put the house up for sale.
You'd better close the window.
It was a silly rumor.
Please answer the phone.
Were you really playing chess at 11:30 last night?
I think Tom really likes you.
It's awfully dangerous.
There are many rivers in India.
Why are you avoiding me?
The sun appeared from behind the clouds.
Can you come here tomorrow?
Tom is chopping firewood.
I often wrote to her when I was a student.
I'm not going to tell you where Tom is.
I'd rather stay at home.
Only a handful of people know the fact.
Have you lost weight?
Do you still love your wife?
What do you have first period?
Excuse me.
May I open the curtain?
Tom gave the money back to Mary.
Mary is Tom's second wife.
I made several mistakes.
I can drive a car.
How is the weather?
Is it true that horses sleep while standing up?
Sport knows no borders.
Your girlfriend is older than mine.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
Tom doesn't understand this.
Do you like gardening?
Could you call Tom for me?
What do you have in your pockets?
Who broke that window pane?
That man ate bread.
Don't eat like a pig.
He mistook me for my mother.
Look at that girl. She's really cute.
He attended the high school for three years without missing a single day or being late.
Everything is upside down.
London is the capital of England.
I haven't bought Tom a Christmas present yet.
He's as strong as a horse.
The car Tom bought is red.
"He said he was sick, but that was a lie."
Are you scared to be alone?
It won't be long before one out of five people owns a car.
I advertised my house in the newspaper.
Tom is one of Mary's neighbors.
I'd like to send this by registered mail.
Tom isn't wearing a belt.
Everybody wants to be happy.
He handed in his resignation.
"Now that you are 18 years old, you should not do such a thing."
You can say that again.
Hold it!
Few people live to be one hundred years old.
It took Tom fifteen minutes of googling before he found what he was looking for.
It was you that suggested seeing that movie.
It's not cold today.
Tom said that I could spend the night at his place.
I asked him to lend me some money.
Eat meals slowly.
The pain you go through because of love is by far sweeter than any other pleasure.
Be quiet for a moment.
Tom says he likes horror movies.
Clean up the room.
It is rude to speak with your hands in your pockets.
I'd like you to have a blood test.
Tom thinks he understands women.
It isn't a game.
Do you know how to use a computer?
I was convinced that he was guilty.
How difficult is it to get a fake passport?
He went hunting in the woods.
All the names are listed in alphabetical order.
Will you be at home all afternoon?
I don't like going out when it's cold.
It's not so easy to forget.
That book is worth reading.
My work is finished.
Don't leave the door open.
Please don't be sad any more.
The main tap is turned off.
Tom was a brave man.
"Hurry up, or you'll miss the train."
How did all this come about?
The rain came down in buckets.
"It tastes very good, doesn't it?"
This isn't a sheep. It's a goat.
All of her songs became hits.
It is said that women live longer than men.
I'd rather starve than steal.
I'd rather die than marry someone like that.
Is this the place where the accident happened?
I heard that Tom went to Boston.
I can't thank him enough.
"Sooner or later, Tom will do that."
I have a lot of things to do today.
It's not important.
I have a credit card.
Where is the cafeteria?
Tom is a very gifted artist.
I've got pins and needles in my leg.
Let's do it again.
I'm glad to hear Tom is well.
He robbed me of every cent I had.
I'm on duty now.
Leave it up to me.
We were caught in a shower on our way home from school.
That's a hard question to answer.
She translated it word for word.
"Hey, I'm tired, so I'm going to go to bed early."
Tom seldom breaks his promise.
That's a famous tune.
Both Tom and Mary are to blame.
I have to take the dog out for a walk.
I'm thankful for my friends.
Have you ever kissed a girl?
Get me some wine.
I walked my dog.
You had better ask him in advance how much it will cost.
Is it OK if I stay home tomorrow?
Please listen carefully.
I'm not a night owl.
The world isn't perfect.
Admission was free.
I saw a flock of sheep.
Tom has good handwriting.
"Everyone went there, didn't they?"
Are you okay?
The children are riding their bikes.
Why am I studying French?
What time shall I call you tonight?
How did you get that bruise on your leg?
A map helps us to know where we are.
Fancy seeing you here.
Tom typed in the password.
You ought to answer for what you have done.
Why can't we do it now?
The dog was run over by a car.
This book is new.
It's hard to break bad habits.
I've just finished eating breakfast.
Get into the car.
It's just what I wanted.
What narrow stairs!
I didn't know that Tom smoked.
She ignored all my warnings.
Could you teach me how to play chess?
Tom sent a video to Mary.
We must leave right away.
I'm struggling with French grammar.
"The cat likes fish, but doesn't like getting its paws wet."
Tom would do that for Mary.
Can you wait about an hour?
Tom isn't aware that Mary lied.
Would it be OK if I took some time off next week?
He's a promising young man.
I don't usually wear makeup.
Tom is an early riser.
It's getting late so I'd better get going.
"Tom grew up in Boston, but now he lives in Chicago."
How much is the bus fare?
You may as well begin at once.
I live in the same dormitory as Tom does.
She gets a high salary.
"I avoid traveling by air, if I can help it."
I didn't know that Tom was back.
He doesn't watch television at all.
Tom is always watching television.
Tom sat in the third row.
I worked on the farm all day.
I've worn out my shoes.
"Does she play tennis? ""Yes, she does."""
Can I ask you why?
"In the sight of God, all men are equal."
I grow rice.
Would you be so kind as to shut that window?
I know that you have a boyfriend.
My father gave up cigarettes.
"When I visited my hometown this summer, I found the city different from what it had been ten years ago."
We probably won't have much snow this winter.
Go to the hospital.
We talked about many things.
Was that a hint?
She asked me to look after her baby in her absence.
I'll make you happy.
Laughter is the best medicine.
I'll catch up with you soon.
The Joneses pay their servant by the week.
I've got a good idea.
Christmas is approaching.
I don't want either of them.
Could you page someone for me?
I've sprained my ankle.
It would break if you dropped it.
Who shall I choose?
Call me if you have a problem.
How many rooms does your house have?
Tom started reading.
We have many rainy days in June.
"In my room, there are no clocks."
He is weak in English.
Tom is one of my classmates.
His family is very large.
We went to Boston.
The conference takes place annually.
You've been had.
We don't have any extra money.
You're very kind.
"He's a good guy now, so he'll make a good husband in the future."
What do you want to be when you grow up?
How far away is the airport?
I know.
That sounds great.
She got to the other side in 10 minutes.
I just got a text from Tom.
Is it a vegetarian restaurant?
It's so big.
No one lives in that building.
I never saw him in jeans.
When did Tom come back from Australia?
I ironed the handkerchief.
I go to the movies once a month.
I don't have any money on me.
I was afraid that I might be late for the bus.
Why have you shut the door?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
There was blood on Tom's uniform.
"When I was fifteen, I got a room of my own."
The experiments led to great discoveries.
I'll call you first thing in the morning.
Tom and Mary are both fast asleep.
They went by subway.
The plane was soon out of sight.
I thought that you said you could swim.
No one asked me any questions.
They were excited over the news.
It's so hard.
Tom was the victim of a heinous crime.
She turned eighty-one.
It's going to rain again tomorrow.
Try on this sweater.
I gained two kilos this summer.
Is Tom in there?
Choose the one you like.
She assumed an air of indifference.
You're bleeding.
The exam was too hard for me.
Is your house new?
Sorry for asking so many questions.
I really love Boston.
Jump!
What made you say such a stupid thing?
Let's talk about this later.
Tom doesn't know how to write a love letter in French.
I am afraid it will rain in the afternoon.
I'll vote for Tom next week.
What time did the concert start?
I helped them yesterday.
My son came to my room.
I feel like a new man.
Tom said Mary looked drunk.
Mind your own business!
We rested for a while.
I don't want your sympathy.
I lost my camera.
It's going to take a lot of time to clean this mess up.
My mother is right.
Skating on the pond is dangerous.
Please bring me a chair.
Is that Tom's phone?
I don't like cats.
Tom doesn't know how to dance.
We are finally free.
Can I come in?
Tom is homeless.
I missed the train by only a few minutes.
I want to send this letter to Japan.
Who's your favorite Canadian author?
Maybe it's about time I started learning to program.
Where did you learn that word?
"Looking out of the window, I saw a rainbow."
The sea is quite rough today.
I almost fainted.
He who knows the most often says the least.
What time would be good for you?
Tom walked through the door.
Have you ever thought of becoming a nurse?
The train left before they got to the station.
May I borrow a duplicate key for Room 360?
"I want beef, too."
"That woman is his wife, I think."
"In these two or three years, he acquired a large amount of wealth."
There's only one day left.
I did exactly what you told me to do.
Is Tom fun?
The roses in the garden are blooming.
"One cup of coffee, please."
It's a pleasure to have you with us again.
Are you still on the team?
I know that I'm in trouble now.
I played tennis after school.
Tom got into the car.
That is her house.
I was quite drunk.
The storm didn't abate for several hours.
May I have a timetable?
"If it rains, I won't go."
The food is cold.
Did Tom ever talk about his father?
The church bells are ringing.
This is our chance.
Could you come to tomorrow's meeting?
I'm sorry to interrupt you while you're talking.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like Tom very much."
Do you want to be a writer?
What time is dinner?
"In any case, it's too late."
Nuclear weapons are a threat to the human race.
I can't stand liars.
Are you going to come back?
It is time to reflect on your past.
I don't think he knows I love you.
What's happened?
Why not go to the movies?
Mary is Tom's twin sister.
Let me say one thing.
Tom isn't the type to hold a grudge.
I'm trying to save money.
Is Tom already here?
I clapped.
I can't wait any longer.
I moved into a new apartment.
"He'll really be happy, won't he?"
Tokyo's population is larger than London's.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
The doors are closing.
Could you translate this document into French?
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
She didn't attend the meeting for fear of meeting her ex-husband.
I'm not in pain.
"You're single, right?"
The door opened by itself.
He is the baby of the family.
I had a good time this evening.
I like that name.
Let's play hide and seek.
It is a matter of life or death.
You're overreacting.
We had an oral exam.
It was a sad story.
It was very hot on the bus.
There are no foxes here.
What should we do if a typhoon comes?
"I had intended to go, but I forgot to."
Are you coming back home soon?
Why did Tom have to go?
I love looking at everyone's colorful kimonos on Coming of Age Day.
Don't make me go back there.
"Tom considers Mary his girlfriend, but she doesn't consider him to be her boyfriend."
She was absent from school because she was sick.
Are Tom and Mary twins?
He threw a stone into the pond.
The floor had a good shine.
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
Mary lost her phone.
I guessed right.
You can give me the details later.
Is it easy to install?
I want a lot more.
That movie was amusing.
"French is difficult, isn't it?"
I have a stomachache.
I never believed that.
Come home before dark.
Tell me your name.
Can somebody answer the phone?
You cannot achieve anything without effort.
Tom is good at French.
Don't be ridiculous!
Tom teaches us French.
It's raining.
Pandas live in bamboo groves.
Tom is swimming.
My legs feel heavy.
It was in 1912 that the Titanic sank during her first voyage.
Could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days?
This knife is used to cut meat.
It doesn't matter to me who wins.
Can the rumor be true?
Will it clear up soon?
Three out of four Americans believe in the existence of paranormal phenomena.
Dreams come true.
I'd like to ask you something.
Tom was the only boy in the entire class.
"Was there anybody in the room? ""No, there was nobody there."""
The boy sat on a chair.
He translated Homer from the Greek into English.
Tom and Mary each have a bicycle.
You did a very good job.
"In the last three years, a lot of new buildings have been built around here."
My father is suffering from a cold.
I'm going to apply for the scholarship.
Could you help us after school?
An eagle is flying in the sky.
I have hardly any English books.
I'll be right back.
Let's relax.
The result was by no means satisfactory.
Don't put me in the same class with them.
I got sunburned.
May I have the key?
Winter is over and spring has come.
We didn't expect it to take this long.
We have snow in January.
I had no choice but to go there.
That's exactly what I thought.
I can't hear you.
I have a big house.
My mother asked us why we'd done that.
The Board of Trustees voted to divest the organization's overseas holdings.
The engine wouldn't start.
Tom was one of three children.
I'm not sure I understand what you are saying.
You can sit here.
The train departs at half past two.
Please write back soon.
Don't come in my room.
I'm tired from lack of sleep.
This one is the same length as that one.
I just hope nothing goes wrong this time.
I got to know Tom when I was in college.
Were you worried about me?
She gave him some food.
I know you are rich.
I went shopping last Saturday.
Those are really big apples.
Have you ever worked at a restaurant before?
I'm free this evening.
That house is big.
I have something to talk over with you.
How much did this umbrella cost?
"She cried and cried, but no one came to comfort her."
I escaped death.
Tom looks relieved.
The cost amounted to five thousand yen.
"I wanted to buy the book, but I found I had no more than 200 yen with me."
What's Tom's girlfriend's name?
Thank you for calling.
Do your best.
Tom isn't what he was three years ago.
The building has 20 floors.
He is an active person.
I awoke to find myself famous.
I'd like to have a coffee.
"I'm going to Hawaii next week. ""Really?"""
I don't know the woman talking to our teacher.
"I'm getting hungry. ""Me, too."" ""Let's eat."" ""OK."""
What's your last name?
He acted as though we had insulted him.
Do you smell something burning?
Tom is looking for somebody to teach him French.
I can play soccer.
Mary likes miniskirts.
I have an older brother.
Why are you busy today?
I see.
There are few places to park around here.
I was so happy to see Tom again.
There's water in this glass.
What do you think of Japan?
All of us like you very much.
I am greatly impressed.
"You're still angry, aren't you?"
You had better take her advice.
Don't give in.
I can't sleep on planes.
"When her husband died, she felt like committing suicide."
Tom is in the church.
This medicine tastes bitter.
You should've told the truth.
You are not a child any more.
Is this uncommon?
The bookstore across from the station is very large.
I want you to help me with my homework.
Mary is Tom's mother.
This problem seems difficult.
Was it you who shut the door?
What are you doing right now?
The crowd gave the winner a big hand.
Did you come here by train or by bus?
Where is the Australian embassy?
"Here, I got us a bottle of white wine."
It may rain.
The president is out now.
"OK, I'll do what you say."
Let's eat first.
Who's your favorite Canadian musician?
I don't like men like him.
The view from the summit is very nice.
I'm willing to help you.
He didn't come on time.
Does that happen a lot?
Do you have a fishing license?
Tom has no siblings.
I've already told Tom that I plan on staying in Boston for another three weeks.
She must have everything her own way.
Please let me make it up to you.
I can explain that.
The girls laughed at Tom.
We are looking forward to hearing about your trip.
My dream has come true.
Tom is a very outgoing person.
I got a call from a male friend yesterday.
"From now on, let's study in the morning."
Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
My nose is itchy.
I can still see my mother's face.
Should I call you a taxi?
I traveled during my summer vacation.
We saw the ground covered with snow.
I watched a documentary.
"When you have a question, ask the teacher."
I cut myself shaving this morning.
Tom probably went to a friend's house.
Her voice carries well.
That's not a fir tree.
"Water, please."
Tom likes tigers.
We climbed up the steep mountain.
She said goodbye.
I turned right.
Hunting is prohibited in this area.
"Come to think of it, I used to sleep in a closet when I was a kid."
Don't look so sad.
I don't want to resign my job at present.
You're a life saver.
I don't know what to study.
Do you remember the first time that we met?
She took a deep breath and then started to talk about herself.
Mary is Tom's fiancée.
"Wouldn't you like to come with us, too?"
There are a lot of parks in London.
Did you work yesterday?
I want to learn Chinese next year.
What're you looking at?
Tom isn't very good at mathematics.
I'll tell Tom everything.
I resign.
Tom could have dealt with the problem in a better way.
Perfect!
"When I woke up, I was in the car."
Tom is in charge of this year's tennis tournament.
The air became warm.
Europe is more dangerous than I thought.
Meetings are held every other week.
It would be better if we didn't attend that meeting.
Forty years passed.
Get your homework done as soon as you can.
Breathe normally.
What time does the play start?
Call the police immediately.
The kids are picking flowers in the garden.
She's Tom's older sister.
It's beyond my comprehension.
I will give you a call as soon as the decision comes through.
The bear left no stone unturned in his search for fat bugs under the rocks.
Thank you for lending us the book.
Tom handed a sandwich to me.
The ball hit her in the eye.
I found the keys I'd lost.
Let's do it this way.
I get sick a lot.
"You won't be late, will you?"
I don't have grandchildren.
My car was stolen last night.
Is there any salt left?
She's anxious to go abroad.
May I have your full name?
I worked a lot today.
The trouble is that she lacks experience.
Don't get carried away.
"If it's a simple tune, I can sight-sing it."
She can take control of the situation.
Why should I help Tom?
This door would not open.
I've lost interest in golf.
I still have the sweater you gave me when I was thirteen.
What answer did you come up with for question three?
He is skating.
These pictures look better at a distance.
I ran as fast as possible.
"Smoking is bad for your health, so you should quit."
Would you prefer to be examined by a female nurse?
Why can't you come?
Tom rides a bike to work.
It's gotten better.
Tom is making some popcorn.
Autumn is the best season for going on hikes.
This bike belongs to my little brother.
"My father can swim, but my mother can't."
It's an illusion.
That building is the tallest in Japan.
Our dad gave it to us.
"The problem is not what he said, but how he said it."
All I can do is wait.
"I got this information second hand, so I may be wrong."
"You're OK, aren't you?"
You're my father.
"Since it's already late, I'll go home."
Excuse me. Who are you?
No one likes war.
He lacks common sense.
"If you're going to the park, take Cookie with you."
Raise your hand.
He respects his father.
Have you seen my jacket?
"Hey, I just had a good idea."
It was a partial success.
How did the accident happen?
Everyone inside the building felt the earthquake.
Put it back where you found it.
I'm glad I could help out.
The road continues for many miles.
I do a lot of work on the school newspaper.
I saw Tom crying.
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?
Are you falling in love with me?
"If it snows tomorrow, I'll build a snowman."
I know you're hiding somewhere in this room.
My sister has already gone to bed.
There's no one in the room.
She had no idea what I said.
My grandfather on my father's side is celebrating his 88th birthday tomorrow.
Did you telephone him?
I've already finished my homework.
He took an oral examination.
I wonder why the bus hasn't come.
What did Tom want?
Find out when Tom's birthday is.
These flowers you see are roses.
Tom stole a police car.
He's better at the piano than I am.
Tom is wearing a wetsuit.
I don't want to be left holding the bag.
"If you throw your jeans in the washing machine, I'll wash them for you."
I spent my summer vacation with my grandmother.
What is your blood type?
I'm busy.
I was at a loss for an answer.
The results are good.
There's no furniture in this room.
My father suggested that we go to the movies this afternoon.
I really don't understand what you're talking about.
I will try it again.
I like this photo.
Can you please tell me where the nearest public telephone is?
I'd prefer not to answer.
I can hardly swim.
Love is a gift from God.
It's always nice to hear from you.
Do you like reading?
Where's my white shirt?
Wax the floor.
Our schedule is pretty full.
Where did this money come from?
"You know his name, don't you?"
I don't want to waste your time.
I blew my whole bonus on shopping and travel.
It's only when I can't sleep at night that the ticking of the clock bothers me.
They had no food.
He has a perfect swing.
"Are you sleeping, Tom?"
I have a throbbing pain here.
Tom mopped his brow with a handkerchief.
Tom didn't dare to open his mouth.
I don't know the reason for her absence.
Please turn off the television.
Tom has connections.
My father has gone to China.
This size doesn't fit me.
How did the traffic accident happen?
This is the center of this city.
Where can I find the post office?
Is this baby a boy or a girl?
It's been raining a lot lately.
I've moved to Boston.
Tell me your story. I am all ears.
There are as many as two hundred cherry trees in this park.
I can't stand people like Tom.
I'm leaving it to you.
The terrorists released the hostages.
Look at the sleeping baby.
Our team is gaining ground.
You and I are kindred spirits.
The line is busy.
Please don't take off your shoes.
How fast can you walk?
My mother gets up the earliest every morning.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
She's learning to swim.
The school doesn't allow students to smoke on campus.
I'm reading a book.
It snowed a good deal last night.
Does he study English every day?
"According to the weather forecast, it's going to rain."
There's a storm coming.
He makes three times more money than I do.
There are a lot of good restaurants near here.
Was Tom invited to Mary's birthday party?
Thank you for your interest.
Do you play any musical instruments?
Have you already started learning French?
I think it's fine.
Thanks for the book.
I often go fishing in that river.
You can sleep on the couch.
"First of all, I will read this."
You look totally exhausted.
Everyone knew that Tom could speak French well.
Many people attended that meeting.
Send me a message as soon as you've arrived.
Can you possibly help me?
It's supper time.
We woke up after midnight.
I agree with him on that point.
I forgot what Tom wanted.
Help!
Use this if you're in danger.
Mary looks like her mother.
Is Tom on this ship?
It's none of my business!
You're shameless.
Tom fell in love with Mary at first sight.
"My father plays golf, but not well."
It is necessary for you to work hard.
My brother lives in a small village.
I'd like to talk to the hotel manager.
Do I look OK?
Is there a vacant seat?
She felt like taking a walk.
There is an apple under the desk.
You've got to be kidding me!
I need to learn how to order food in French.
Thank you for your trouble.
I always get nervous just before a match.
The mosquito net was torn.
He was wounded in the shoulder.
My money was stolen.
It is too expensive.
She is a good dancer.
The toilet won't stop running.
Tom came back to Boston in 2013.
"No matter how hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can."
Is the hotel close to the airport?
"Excuse me, how can I get to the library?"
Where's your dog?
It is believed that whales have their own language.
"To my disappointment, he had already started."
He decided to go abroad.
Tom ironed his pants.
Why were you smiling?
I've made up my mind to study harder from now on.
A true gentleman would not betray his friends.
There are elevators over there.
I envy him.
I don't want to think about homework right now.
Life in the country isn't always tranquil.
Those mechanics are paid as much as ten thousand yen per hour.
I lost interest.
Tom and I are going to climb Mt. Fuji next summer.
I had a cup of coffee at the cafe.
Our bus collided with a truck.
Tom would like to live in the country.
My mother set the table.
"As you know, I'm a very busy person."
I've lost the key to my room.
It was Tom who showed me how to do this.
He earns three times more than me.
Sorry for all the typos.
Don't worry about that kid.
I plan to go by train.
"Once I started college, I barely had time to sleep."
It isn't important.
We'll discuss the problem with them.
Thanks a lot.
Has Tom been crying?
That's not fair.
He seems to think so.
I'm looking for a hat to match a brown dress.
Air is a mixture of gases that we can't see.
He sometimes goes to Tokyo on business.
Lack of sleep began to tell on me.
Don't touch the flowers.
What are your plans for the weekend?
You have nothing to fear.
It's not necessary to write more than 400 words.
I've spent the morning writing letters.
"He's rich, but he lives like a beggar."
The three of us spend a lot of time together.
That store is open all year round.
Tom wants to go somewhere else.
Are you sure that you locked the door?
I would do anything but that.
I really appreciate it.
Tom has a bad reputation.
We got up at dawn.
A tear ran down her cheek.
Tom dozed on the sofa.
You can go anywhere you want.
I wonder why Tom changed his mind.
I always got up early in my childhood.
"Because of the typhoon, the school was closed."
I have a daughter.
Why do you like coffee strong?
Tom has an inferiority complex.
I'll go if Tom goes.
Go over it again.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
I'll try my hand at cooking.
Can you come?
The doors open automatically.
"When it's hot, there's nothing like a ice cold beer."
He's crazy about baseball.
We found the boy fast asleep.
Are we in any particular hurry?
Did Tom move back to Boston?
We stayed there for three months.
You won't be in time unless you run.
They teased the new student.
I think Tom will get here soon.
Tom had one of his socks on inside out.
Where's the restroom?
Were you able to find Tom?
She made a new suit for him.
This room is air-conditioned.
"Without water, you could not live."
What are you plans for tomorrow?
I don't care what the consequences are.
I can't write with this dull pencil.
What does it mean?
This is the place where the accident happened.
Our company is planning to build a new chemical plant in Russia.
She was hit by a car.
Where did you meet your wife?
"By chance, I met your brother on the street."
What happened? The car's slowing down.
I like to go and watch baseball games.
It seems that he is unable to swim.
This is insoluble in water.
It was a terrible affair.
His girlfriend is Japanese.
How in the world did you know that?
"Will he pass the examination? ""I am afraid not."""
My father is suffering from a cold.
It's nearly three o'clock.
Please help me.
I'm here because I want to be.
Not all swans are white.
I froze at the sight of the snake.
That boy is very smart.
Tom can't yet tie his own shoes.
I closed my umbrella.
I heard him humming in the shower.
I have to get off at the next stop.
You seem to be thinking of something else.
Tom thinks that he's better than other people.
Is this cup clean?
Tom is a jazz singer in Boston.
Anyone can do it.
There are no dogs bigger than this one.
You can use this pen.
I'm coming at once.
Could you swim across this river?
We had hoped to go abroad this summer.
I'm saving up to buy a new car.
We have three sons.
I sometimes put a little salt in it.
Are you sure this is where Tom was?
I've seen this picture before.
Rhinos sometimes attack people.
She went to Chicago by bus.
I was kept awake all night by the noise.
The house was in flames.
"I would buy this watch, except it's too expensive."
That'd be the last thing I want to do.
I broke my arm when I was a child.
Why do you give money to Tom?
She's my daughter.
It's not your fault.
Let's meet sometime in the near future.
Tom fell off a swing and injured himself.
It was uncertain whether he would marry her.
He won't listen to me.
Nothing can be better than that.
I think machine translation will get better with time.
You need to be more careful.
Do you have anything to say regarding this?
The thief entered the house through this door.
His hands feel rough.
Anybody can do that.
The store was relatively empty.
I got a new pair of shoes.
Ten paper plates cost one dollar.
What time do you think Tom will come back?
Their contract is to run out at the end of this month.
I don't know what you want to do.
I'm going to Australia on Monday.
Tom said he'd be back next Monday.
Isn't that skirt too short?
I wonder whether Tom likes Mary or not.
I saw Tom play tennis.
My brother is now in Australia.
I bought some clothes.
The rescue workers are going to hand out supplies to the victims of the earthquake.
He worked all the harder because his master praised him.
Why did you lie?
Don't be so cheeky.
"According to TV news, there was a plane crash in India."
Why don't we share a room?
I got on the wrong train.
I'm not good with this sort of thing.
We have a lot of rain in June.
The tablecloth is in the cupboard.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Days are getting shorter.
Spring has finally arrived.
Your perfume is really strong.
Thanks all the same.
The prisoner was released.
"She was not merely beautiful, but also talented."
Prompt action is necessary.
Our car broke down.
I often go swimming in the river.
I really like red sportscars.
I'll follow.
He can swim well.
He earns three times as much as I do.
What's your address?
I want the wax cleaned from my ears.
I never said that.
I moved to Boston the year before last.
I think things will be OK.
Say hello to your friends.
This food is very nutritious.
I thought Tom would be here by now.
That man sometimes talks nonsense.
It suddenly started raining very hard.
It's very kind of you to invite me to your birthday party.
He's over thirty.
I'm going to have to pass on that.
Tom is a fussy eater.
You and I are soulmates.
"I know it's early, but let's go home."
Tom is a Canadian.
Do you know who he was?
My dreams have come true.
Tom and Mary are both vegetarians.
Please hold on a moment.
Don't you wanna go?
"Aren't you hungry, Tom?"
I am interested in Japanese history.
Are you scared?
We live in the atomic age.
I've never been so humiliated in my life.
Please wash my back.
Please enjoy your trip.
I thought you were mad at Tom.
What does she do?
There were so many people.
Why is it so hard for you to be nice to your brother?
Don't pick that up. It's dirty.
Tom called me a taxi.
Don't be late for work.
What makes you think that?
There are many theories about the origin of life.
I think that it's dangerous to go walking alone at night.
What was Tom doing in your room?
She's forbidden to go out.
It's not that bad.
She isn't married.
There's someone waiting outside.
She's in the bath.
Take care not to break the glasses.
She saw him driving his new car.
The sky was completely dark.
"Don't work too much, OK?"
I want to be a teacher.
Luckily nobody died.
How should I know?
Do you have any other questions?
I want to ask you a few questions.
I wish I were a bird.
The lemon is a sour fruit.
"When I was a kid, I used to often play in that park."
Don't let this chance slip by.
Tom is a lot taller than Mary.
The wind is blowing from the west.
Why did he do such a thing?
I can't imagine life without music.
She plays the piano by ear.
This is reality.
Tom is the oldest.
Are you two busy?
I have a sharp pain in my chest.
"Like it or not, you have to do that right away."
Does that store sell bread?
He runs a shoe shop.
Are you sleepy?
Let me sleep for another ten minutes.
Don't you feel the house shaking?
"Can I take photographs here? ""Only outside."""
Just follow your heart.
It looks like today is not my lucky day.
I worked there.
Do you know those people?
May I speak with you?
Tom said that he didn't know anyone who could speak French.
It was raining and the game was called off.
The boy who lives next door often comes home late.
What's the name of that game?
The rooms are clean and comfortable.
I thought that I told you to stay in the car.
It happened to me about a year ago.
I know Tom is strong.
"Yeah. I think so, too."
Are you a competitive person?
Would you like to come to our house?
They're woodpeckers.
Many people need help.
Many people think that children spend too much time watching TV.
I'm dating my sister's boyfriend's sister.
You have my sympathies.
I've done all that I can.
Go find Tom.
Do you have laundry service?
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
Do you like golf?
We happened to meet at the station.
Do you know who stole Tom's laptop?
Did Tom tell you?
What did she buy at that store?
It seems that Tom used to be a great athlete.
Tom can't eat with chopsticks.
Dangerous driving should be punished.
She owns two thousand books.
"Some believe in God, but others do not."
When did you have your last physical examination?
"Hey look, it's Tom."
"Judging from what everyone says, it's the truth."
What is he like?
"Give me some water, please."
Tom is my friend.
I think that Tom is a little too optimistic.
He seems to be sick.
I demand to know what's going on here.
I wonder whether this is really true.
Many clients come to that lawyer for advice.
Mary isn't Tom's granddaughter. She's his niece.
It's OK with me if you take that book.
"If you go to the movies, take your sister with you."
All the letters that I received from Tom were in French.
I think Tom is sympathetic.
Would you care for more coffee?
Tom was unhappy because she wouldn't ask him anything.
I'll decide later.
Tom told me.
We can't afford to waste any more time.
You're exactly like your father.
Mary knew she was good-looking.
Stop beating around the bush and give it to me straight!
I've never tried this.
I must put some air in the tire.
There is no hurry.
Something is missing.
Wait over there.
I bought this book at the bookstore in front of the station.
Do you think I should go by myself?
Are you two ready?
My college has a dorm.
No one wants to work outdoors on a cold day.
I've never seen a temple this big before.
Tom doesn't love Mary anymore.
Bring me two more chairs.
He was reluctant to answer.
He's good at flying kites.
Follow me.
Promises are made to be broken.
A few people clapped after his lecture.
Tom looks sick.
Can you give me a discount?
They built a snowman together.
She bit him.
They look healthy.
I can't explain everything now.
I bought a camera two days ago.
She was kind enough to make tea for us.
"Let me think it over, and I'll let you know later."
It isn't mine.
I never ever want to see you again.
Did you intend to kill Tom?
What is going on?
Would you be so kind as to repeat that?
I didn't have enough money to buy a present for Tom.
He resembles his grandfather.
"This chair was cheap, but it's very comfortable."
Put more salt in the soup.
This will do for the time being.
My father is healthy.
I thought we were supposed to have breakfast together.
"Turn on the light, please."
I'm happy.
Don't make a noise.
We're brothers.
Don't count your chickens until they've hatched.
"Thanks to you, the job went well."
I need some soap.
My hobby is cooking.
I'm so worn out.
I spilled coffee on your tablecloth.
Tom had been standing in the rain for what seemed like hours.
I hear my uncle died of cancer.
He doesn't have any children.
Can I come in for a few minutes?
What happened? There's water all over the apartment.
"Can I help you? ""No, thank you. I'm just looking around."""
My father was religious and he was a very moral man.
Who unplugged the TV?
Tom brought Mary a gift.
It's time for a bath.
How many caps does Tom have?
I can't thank you enough for all your kindness.
This is my red pencil.
I hate policemen like him.
Do you like cupcakes?
Where are your things?
Few people came to the lecture.
Watch this.
I got to know him when I was a student.
I think Tom is lucky.
Tom had no choice but to buy a new phone.
I was woken up by the sound of thunder this morning.
"Tom was your boyfriend when you were in high school, wasn't he?"
The snow prevented me from going there.
What a wonderful idea!
These are two nice pictures.
I can't ride a motorcycle.
Tom sat by the fireplace.
He is still angry.
You ought to do that right away.
Something really nice happened to me today.
I had nothing to do with that accident.
Is it humid now in Boston?
I feel like singing in the rain.
"The room only had a bed, a table and a chair."
We ran after the cat.
What were you thinking just now?
Tom was sitting at the next table.
Is that Tom singing?
Did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?
I'd like to speak to you in private.
The old man suddenly started talking to me.
I went to the hospital to see my uncle.
Are all these books yours?
Tom is a nice guy.
They kept it to themselves that the king was dead.
How old are Tom's children?
May I take your picture?
Were you able to get in touch with Tom?
Try it once more.
How many were injured?
Tom leaned towards Mary.
Don't bother me.
It's going to be another hot day.
She will give a party next week.
You have a gift for music.
I helped my brother move his desk.
Do you have money for the taxi?
Does this bus go to the train station?
I lived in this house as a child.
I calculated that it would cost 300 dollars.
I live in a country where the cost of a liter of gasoline is cheaper than the cost of a liter of water.
Won't you take a chair?
A trip to Hawaii costs around 200 dollars.
Why don't you be quiet?
I forgot to charge my cellphone.
Their cattle are all fat.
It has become much warmer.
From here to there takes about thirty minutes by car.
He entered junior high school.
Don't forget the ticket.
Do you sometimes get headaches?
We made him cry.
I'm a high school math teacher.
I don't switch on the light in my studio at night.
He was absent from school because he was sick.
I don't know how to drive.
Leave that to the experts.
Is Tom still mad?
Mind your own business!
"By the way, where do you live?"
It was a nice story.
Scattered clouds mean heavy rain.
Tom arrived precisely on time.
Please wait for me at the entrance of the building.
Do you want to read this magazine?
Tom will tell Mary.
"The radius of the earth is about 6,000 kilometers."
It's very unlikely that the teacher will believe Tom's excuse for not having his homework done on time.
Would you like some dinner?
I thought we wouldn't see each other again today.
The brake didn't work.
I want to surprise Tom.
Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
Is Tom still dating Mary?
"When I saw them on a date, I asked them, ""Are you getting married soon?"""
I don't play tennis very often.
You do ask a lot of questions.
Have you ever pruned a tree?
Is Tom working today?
Are you in much pain?
Never be late for school again.
Bees fly from flower to flower.
I'm trying to meet a deadline.
Are you currently taking any kind of medication?
Are you wearing new shoes?
I'm very surprised that Tom isn't here.
I waited for a bus to come.
It's still there.
"When I think about those students, it gives me a headache."
Is this store open on Sundays?
I'm on good terms with my brother.
Are you interested in Japanese music?
She's at the hotel now.
He quit smoking.
I'll carry that luggage.
He is the image of his father.
Today is Thursday.
An elephant is an enormous animal.
It isn't so muggy today.
My family had many debts.
"If I'd known, I would've told you."
"I ran as fast as possible, but I was not in time for the last train."
Tom believes in the existence of ghosts.
My dream is to lead a quiet life in the country.
Tom has a Ford.
Eat more slowly.
Let me carry that for you.
"Today, I just want to stay home and do nothing."
You should give up smoking.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
What sort of person would do that kind of thing?
A dog bit her on the leg.
I think he's correct.
You should put your ideas in writing.
I painted the fence green.
He often doesn't come to school.
I live with my uncle.
They set off fireworks.
I think this information will help.
What's done can't be undone.
Show me what's in your hand.
I finally came up with a great idea.
What are some good pickup lines?
Two men were fighting on the street.
A fire broke out in a neighborhood hotel.
Are you bilingual?
I know that you're very busy.
"If there's anything I can do for you, tell me."
What are you into these days?
Can someone explain this to me?
It was very cold that evening.
It's been a long time.
You have pretty eyes.
"After their parents died, their grandparents brought them up."
We got behind the car and pushed.
It's very ordinary.
The only one who really knows us is God.
She is easygoing.
You have a healthy baby boy.
Don't release that dog.
"After breakfast, we went out for a walk."
Have you been to Australia or New Zealand in the past three weeks?
Come in quickly.
How exactly does this work?
I had breakfast at seven-thirty.
Have you already done your homework?
"He is at work now, but will come back at seven."
I don't feel like drinking beer tonight.
Tom's life is in danger.
Tom has started dating an older woman.
This car is going 60 kilometers an hour.
Life is like a journey.
Just seeing it made me nervous.
I will give you this book.
Let's put it to a vote.
I haven't spoken to Tom since I left Boston.
Draw a line from A to B.
Did you play football in college?
Tom is a good golfer.
May we go home?
I'm not picky. I'll eat anything.
Thanks for asking.
I'm in the twelfth grade.
It's safer here.
She has a bag under her arm.
The children are playing in the snow.
Moderate exercise is good for your health.
I hope that we have time to prepare for that.
Fashions change quickly.
I don't think he is truthful.
"I don't know if I've ever told you, but you have beautiful eyes."
The explanation is simple.
I hate myself sometimes.
I'm afraid I can't make a nine o'clock appointment.
"You're both Canadians, aren't you?"
I didn't know what to say.
They grind wheat into flour.
I don't want to do that alone.
Do you have a better idea?
He selected a pair of socks to match his suit.
I tried to change the topic as fast as possible.
Is Tom going to come today?
I wonder if you could tell me if there is a post office in this area.
Do you think that you could do that?
Wipe your face clean.
"I tried hard to make them stay home, but they refused to listen to me."
He rarely goes to church.
Colder weather is on the way.
"I'm happy, too."
This door locks by itself.
Tom does nothing but play all day.
There is much that is good in the world.
I slept soundly last night.
It was impossible to escape.
My arm hurts.
Thank you for inviting me.
Do you need a lift?
How soon will you be able to finish that job?
"The longer you stay, the more overtime pay you'll get."
How did you know that I was hungry?
Tom isn't as young as I am.
Would you like to talk over a cup of coffee?
The thief reluctantly admitted his guilt.
What can I do for you?
Tom didn't mention what he was planning to do.
"Since there were no taxis, I had to walk."
Thank you for rescuing us.
I was dumbfounded.
I've got a feeling that something is about to happen.
He likes mountaineering and is well acquainted with the mountains of Japan.
I must've lost the key en route.
I think she'll be able to answer the phone around 4:00.
Why learn French?
He named his dog Popeye.
Are you able to swim well?
The girl who's talking with Tom is Mary.
Grandmother sent us a box of apples.
I am sure of her success.
I thank you for your kindness.
I feel old.
Are you ready yet?
She was listening to music.
Please hold on.
I know Tom understands French.
Please come.
I guess I'm never going to get married.
I'm up next.
Tourism generated many new jobs.
They failed to take into account the special needs of old people.
There's nothing wrong with this.
It's sad.
How did you get into my room?
I doubt whether Tom will come.
I enjoyed myself at the party last night.
I have a twin sister.
See you.
The coat doesn't have any pockets.
The room was illuminated with red lights.
Everyone knows that Tom likes Mary.
He would not listen to my advice.
I collect stamps as a hobby.
Do you live near here?
"You worked in Australia for a few years, didn't you?"
Tom was just taking pictures.
Wash the dishes.
A considerable number of students want to go to college.
I'm sure that I can overcome any difficulty.
I have an identical twin.
I think you should do a bit more.
"At last, the truth was revealed to us."
Let's go for a walk after it stops raining.
You should acknowledge your failure.
I wonder how Tom is doing.
I never work on weekends.
I'm waiting outside.
Two heads are better than one.
I have a chest cold.
I keep meaning to organize my desk.
My mother and I were in the garden.
Get out of here immediately!
Have you ever lent money to Tom?
Tom is addicted to gambling.
Tom and Mary are planning to get divorced.
"Mary wouldn't really eat that, would she?"
We have to rent a room to hold the party in.
Money can't buy happiness.
It's easy to learn.
Now go on home.
Silence is golden.
"I ran to school, but the bell had already rung."
The only thing that Tom knows how to cook is scrambled eggs.
I tripped and nearly fell.
Is it raining now?
Is there any chance of his recovery?
Tom didn't live a long life.
I avoid drinking coffee in the evening.
We have a lot of time.
Daikon might be more expensive than the carrots.
Is it worth it or not?
There's a church in the center of the village.
I'm afraid that I won't finish on time.
She set out for Thailand.
What does your father do?
Why did you buy a flower?
I'm fed up with Tom.
I don't like spring.
My brother is three years younger than me.
You can swim very well.
Tom had no idea what Mary was going to cook for him.
That movie was shown on television.
Tom wanted to see you.
Close all the doors and windows.
You can eat it raw.
I remember that man's name very well.
I think you're right.
When will they arrive?
They collect our garbage every Monday.
Do you know what she said?
"You've never been in love, have you?"
He gets his hair cut once a month.
The Amazon is the second longest river in the world after the Nile.
The stone was so heavy that nobody could lift it.
I think his novel is boring.
The girl trembled with fear.
I think Tom doesn't realize how charming he is.
Let some fresh air in.
Did you just arrive?
Everybody knows that.
I like blue better than red.
I admit that I was careless.
Please take care of yourself.
I have nothing particular to do now.
Tom admitted that what he did was wrong.
How bad is Tom's injury?
"I love karaoke, but I'm not much of a singer."
I bought the same shirt as yours.
His mother was a school teacher.
The air on top of the mountain was very thin.
"Will it stop raining soon? ""I don't think so."""
I want to read the book.
What's your sign?
Tom is wearing gloves.
I have been absorbed in reading a mystery.
What would you like for Christmas?
Tom said he'd be willing to do this.
I found an empty seat.
I'm not going to do anything.
That singer has a beautiful voice.
I had doubts.
"Tom tried to speak, but couldn't."
Tom has no idea why Mary hates him.
Tom wants to know when we're going to Australia.
Were you able to talk to Tom?
Blood is thicker than water.
Tom goes to night school.
Wait!
Would you mind if I turned the radio off?
"Tom, I want you to listen to me."
Why do you think that?
The other one doesn't work.
Tom was really drunk last night.
What a pity!
"I'm sorry, I forgot to do my homework."
What else do you have?
A ball is floating down the river.
How long did you stay?
I drank the wine.
The movie is X-rated.
I want to leave school.
I've nothing to do today.
"If you have any questions, feel free to ask."
I just wanted to be sure.
Can I have a cookie?
I grew up eating Japanese food.
You only think about yourself.
I'd like to buy a camera.
She's a dog.
He came out from behind the curtain.
You've got a great memory.
Tom's efforts came to nothing.
I'm free on Sunday.
Tom reached for his knife.
We will end today's lesson here.
I miss you when you aren't here.
Few girls were late for school.
I don't have time to do all the paperwork.
That is not a tiger.
Where is Tom's house?
"It was already after 8 o'clock, so we called it a day."
Where's the nearest church?
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
"To drive a car, you need a license."
Can I check in?
He smoked as if nothing had happened.
Tom almost forgot about the meeting.
Tom no longer smokes.
I'm the CEO.
The box was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
The train we'll be on will arrive at 9 p.m.
I'm terribly hungry.
Tom's my friend.
May I borrow your pen?
I don't read the newspapers.
This feels like silk.
Tom got furious.
The man dashed the bottle against the wall.
Who did you get this from?
Tom worked at a local prison.
The bag was so heavy that I couldn't carry it by myself.
I have something I want to give to you.
I had no trouble finding his office.
I'd like a money order for ten dollars.
The sum of two plus three plus four is nine.
His proposals were adopted at the meeting.
Do you have any food allergies?
He couldn't bear the heat.
An accident took place at the intersection.
I found the chair was comfortable when I sat on it.
Few students use pencils these days.
We have a lot of things we need to buy.
She spoke with tears in her eyes.
Have you read today's newspaper yet?
"Of course, the answer is yes."
What subjects do you like best?
I heard that they found the footprints of an abominable snowman in the Himalayas.
Were you at Tom's party?
"At present, the cause of the disease is unknown."
"Seen from a distance, this mountain looks like Mt. Fuji."
He is an ideal husband for me.
I gave him my address.
Try it again.
Are you still waiting for Tom?
Anyone can make mistakes.
I don't like that store.
I'm not afraid of lightning.
I don't know her.
I don't think that you need that much money to buy what you need.
Small animals are very cute.
She grew up to be a beautiful lady.
I found this book in a secondhand bookstore.
Don't break the branches.
Tom went to Boston for work.
My dream is to become a firefighter.
"When you're a father, you'll understand."
We often eat fish raw in Japan.
Tom ate it.
I have to go to the station at three o'clock.
My brother would often stay up all night reading novels.
I'm really surprised that Tom isn't here.
A rose's petals are very delicate.
What a beautiful flower!
The temperature has been below freezing for several days.
Let me think it over a bit.
I'm giving up smoking.
How would you translate this into French?
This is a picture of the ship that Tom and I were on.
I go to the park.
Do you know how to eat durian?
Tom has been ignoring me.
Where's there a supermarket around here?
The cherry blossoms are at their best.
Are all the passengers aboard?
Loose jackets are the latest fad.
Who will you see tomorrow?
I look forward to it.
Let me know your new address.
The baby doesn't walk yet.
She is living abroad.
I don't want to go shopping today.
I'm free tonight.
Do you know how much you weigh?
Show me.
See you at school tomorrow.
That's fascinating.
You'll have to ask at the newsstand.
Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
Tom doesn't like music.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
The medicine had an immediate effect.
We all know that no one is perfect.
Mary isn't really sick. She's just faking it.
Help me up.
The room was warm.
"Someone said something, but I could not understand it."
The two men blamed each other for the crime.
Tom entered the room and turned on the lights.
Do you need a license to use an electric wheelchair?
I decided to go anyway.
I like beef more than anything else.
I haven't practiced my French in a long time.
Tom is a good captain.
I am 19 years old.
It's just stopped raining.
Can I take a picture of you?
Radishes might be more expensive than the carrots.
Grandfather is still very active for his age.
Have you had abdominal pain recently?
Come back soon.
It's a shame the way old people are treated.
Tom doesn't know what to say to make Mary feel better.
He has a weak will.
"Sorry, but I think you've got the wrong number."
He isn't able to do that.
"I think if I talked more often with a native speaker, my English skills would improve quickly."
I don't want to talk to Tom anymore.
I counted up to 200.
The books that I bought are on the desk.
I thought that you said you were scared to do that.
"No, that's wrong."
You sound like you enjoyed it.
The new plan is based on our idea.
Our dog has gone away.
That happened in 2013.
"Hurry up, or you'll be late."
Thank you very much for your help.
I can see why Tom likes Mary.
My alarm clock didn't go off this morning.
"When it's hot, there's nothing like a cold beer."
"This hall can hold 5,000 people."
The situation is worse than we believed.
The rebels made a barricade across the road.
I thought that you were going to wear your new suit.
I want a laptop.
There's little time left.
Don't be so impatient.
I'm sure he'll pass the upcoming exam.
Tom was liked by everybody.
I'll tell you everything about it.
I can't bear the pain.
We have a legal obligation to pay our taxes.
I only found out about it purely by accident.
Could you find me an attorney?
I don't put sugar in my coffee.
What color is your shirt?
Tom has never been able to beat me.
I like studying languages.
What do you intend to do?
Would you play with me?
I gave up keeping up with trends.
"Chicken is cheap, but beef tastes better."
"Give me that book, please."
She came here as soon as she heard it.
I hope the fog will lift soon.
How can you tell good English from bad English?
What's eating her?
"You're from Australia, right?"
When can I see you?
I paid three dollars for that book.
I'll get you this bag.
The club members assembled in the meeting room.
I seldom eat dairy products.
Why is Tom here and not Mary?
Nobody knows about the plan.
Let's do it right away.
She's only a child.
What's wrong with being nude in your own house?
Tom is making dinner.
I have plenty of money with me.
We could've helped him.
Tom is absorbed in his work.
I understand the feeling.
This medicine will take the pain away.
My mother must be angry.
I stopped smoking.
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
What are our plans for today?
Don't eat too much bread.
Eat with who you want to eat with.
She's a fox.
Could you move forward so we can close the door?
Any child can do that.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
"Without music, the world would be a boring place."
I don't know how to draw a bird.
I did not notice how glad she was.
What can I do for you?
Don't judge by appearances.
Tom ran up the stairs.
Please lock the door when you leave.
I shave every morning.
I'm going to attempt CPR.
Why did you decide to learn French?
Eating between meals is a bad habit.
This room is large enough.
"Some TV programs are interesting, and others are not."
Take your uniform off.
I've been looking for this for a long time.
We do need your advice.
No one can solve this problem.
How much did you pay Tom?
Let's meet at the station.
I must get my hair cut.
Tom won't even look at me.
The water is lukewarm.
I'm feeling nostalgic.
The roses are in bloom in our garden.
We grow rice.
Both of Tom's sisters are beautiful.
There's something here.
He addressed the audience in a soft voice.
How far are you going?
"I'm fine, thank you."
You don't notice your mistakes.
The sun is shining brightly.
Let's talk later.
We shouldn't judge people by how they look.
We must develop renewable energy sources.
"For me, there's nothing more fun to do than to talk with Tom."
I thought you'd be kind of surprised.
Can you teach me French?
He's been waiting here for a long time.
I have a lot to do today.
My father died when I was thirteen.
It's difficult.
It was cold this morning when I left the house.
He made up his mind to write in his diary every day.
How many flights to Boston do you offer a day?
Are you waiting for anyone?
His office is located in the center of the town.
I've stopped drinking coffee.
"Once a month, I go to the hairdresser."
In autumn the leaves turn yellow.
I study mathematics.
I was having lunch.
How much money do you want?
"Tom, where are you?"
Permanent peace is nothing but an illusion.
Is it Tom's and my turn?
Watch out for pickpockets.
The Japanese take their shoes off before entering their homes.
What's your favorite fruit?
I know that Tom is about three years older than Mary.
Have you ever eaten anything that Tom's cooked?
I like working out.
They admired the scenic view from the hill.
"Tom walks 10,000 steps per day."
Is spaghetti OK?
It's up to you.
Tom believes ghosts exist.
Please don't write to me again.
He ran so fast that they couldn't catch up with him.
The water will come to a boil in 5 minutes or so.
Help me do my homework.
We are almost there.
He is not always busy in the morning.
I like your smile.
The surgeon persuaded me to undergo an operation.
Are you still going to Boston?
I have a friend who works for NASA.
He slowly moved forward.
It's really dangerous.
I regret not having taken his advice.
Put some salt on your meat.
Do you think that I'm cute?
"Since I was cold, I put on a sweater."
Please come here between two and three this afternoon.
I forgot to phone him.
Tom took his children to school.
I already know everything.
I don't want to wake up the children.
All the students have gone home.
I hope the weather will clear up on Sunday.
I lost weight this week.
"As a rule, I go to school before eight o'clock."
Tom couldn't answer any of my questions.
How is the weather there?
"I don't have a car, so I couldn't go."
He would wait for hours for her call.
Were you successful?
Who's the owner of this car?
Tom is impulsive.
I heard my name called.
I'll support you as much as I can.
He drinks a lot.
Did you enjoy the film?
I thought that that was really weird.
I'm early.
The train was held up because of the railroad accident.
"You didn't know anything about this, did you?"
"Can I see your ticket? ""Yes. Here it is."""
Either you or I am wrong.
Don't talk about it in my mother's presence.
Come and see me whenever you like.
Tom is back at work.
It doesn't hurt at all.
He knows a lot of people.
Tom is at the end of the line.
"Are you all right, Tom?"
That's absolutely right.
Won't you come to my house next Sunday?
Please do not feed the animals.
I wish I could cook better.
The moon has no atmosphere.
It was a lot of fun.
Please behave like an English gentleman.
"When she heard the news, she broke down crying."
A strong wind blew all day long.
I often do that in the evening.
Are all the windows locked?
We should set a trap.
Tom spent the day in his room.
Thousands of people were deceived by the advertisement.
They will be taken good care of.
He was walking toward the sea.
Do you have any Japanese magazines?
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
She is helping him.
Do you think Tom can speak French?
Teenagers must adapt to today's harsh realities.
This machine is hard to operate.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
I don't want lunch.
Tom was often late for school.
We have a little problem.
I wish that were true.
My sight isn't as good as it used to be.
He found it difficult to please his father.
"Grandpa, what are you doing? ""I'm shaving."""
These machines aren't working now.
How can you eat so much?
You have to turn in the reports on Monday.
Tom's family loved me.
She lent me her bicycle.
"I want a car, but I have no money to buy one."
Wake the kids.
Tom didn't want to answer Mary's question.
Perhaps it will rain tomorrow.
These socks do not match.
Try and swim!
I'll send you the link when I get home.
Should I reply to his letter?
It isn't at all rare to live to be over ninety years old.
Enter your name.
This is wrong.
Tom looked like he was tired.
They believe in God.
How about adding a touch of pepper?
"One of his two daughters lives in Tokyo, and the other in Nara."
We took a mud bath.
My father is coming home tomorrow.
He has a high batting average.
I hope you get well soon.
I think that Tom hasn't left yet.
He gets angry very easily.
Do you know why?
Would you rather live in a big city or a small town?
It rained continuously for three days.
Will you pass me the salt?
"Tom is three years older than I am, but he's shorter than I am."
I don't understand at all.
How old do you think she is?
"To see him talk, you might think he's a girl."
The train was crowded with high school students.
Tom is much taller than Mary is.
I understand.
Tom wants a bigger house.
How did you enjoy the movie?
"At the time of the accident, almost all of the passengers on the bus were sleeping."
He met his English teacher at the station by accident.
Don't touch my sandwich.
Tom heard Mary shout.
You'll improve with practice.
The food was finger-licking good.
Tom is ironing his shirts.
Never hesitate to tell the truth.
Tom said that no one was in a hurry.
They announced the date of their wedding in the newspaper.
It's an honor to meet you.
We've got a real blizzard here.
Do you have any quarters?
Do you know him?
Tom made Mary wash the car.
This is smaller than that.
Tom now drinks a lot more than he used to.
There's a car outside.
I felt so sleepy that I could hardly keep my eyes open.
The dog is playing with the cat.
"For further information, see page 16."
Somebody must've left it there.
Do you like pears?
Tom thought that no one was looking.
Please give me the book.
You shouldn't go out after dark.
Will you go to Tom's wedding?
Do you have a similar saying in Japanese?
I'm crazy about American football.
My parents never let me go to my friends' houses.
Could you do this instead of me?
How do you make a box?
There are puddles everywhere.
My younger brother swims every day in the summer.
"Nagasaki, where I was born, is a beautiful port city."
What does UN stand for?
Cut it out.
My sister is very fond of children.
It's raining hard.
Tom likes brown rice.
"Judging from the look of the sky, it's likely to rain."
It will get warmer and warmer.
"If you aren't careful, you'll fail again."
She works in a bank.
Tom wouldn't lend me his bicycle.
I remember reading this novel.
"The next day, Tom came back home."
We must pay attention to environmental problems.
I thought I was a fairly good swimmer.
Somebody is following me.
I keep thinking about Tom.
It's Tom and Mary's wedding anniversary today.
Tom is well-informed about the circumstances present within the Indian agricultural community.
The doctor placed a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
I was amazed to learn I had won.
Tom drinks six cups of coffee a day.
Water transmits sound better than air.
Don't change your mind.
I want some orange juice.
I sent you an e-mail.
How many children do you want to have when you get married?
I studied yesterday.
I don't know why I want it so much.
A person at the store wrapped the gift for me.
Please take off all of your clothes from the waist up.
I've been to Australia once.
It is clear what must be done.
I always keep my word.
What I mean is this.
"I'm busy right now, Tom."
"Everyone, say cheese."
It is a pity that he died so young.
I didn't eat lunch yesterday.
Last month he had his house painted white.
"Recently, 24 hours per day hasn't really felt like enough."
Tom wants to buy Mary a gift.
"Tom stepped forward to kiss Mary, but she stepped back."
Tom's house burned down.
"Just because I'm a wolf, everybody assumes I'm a bad guy."
I've got a headache.
Open your eyes.
"Well, it'll do for the time being."
This book has a library stamp.
She's always grumbling.
I'll ask Tom.
The cat peeped its head out the window.
I always walk to school.
Nobody can help me.
Please help yourself to some fruit.
Don't stand in my way.
I'm not like you.
Have you seen any movies recently?
Is that a llama?
Tom is already drunk.
What's this flower called?
We can see a church over there.
"In my spare time, I enjoy reading."
You can see the tower from here.
Believe in yourself.
My family is not that large.
We eat supper about six o'clock.
This isn't the entrance.
Do you really want to go to Australia?
How did your test go?
I really like this book.
I've burnt the toast.
Take it easy.
She looks happy.
I'm sorry about the other day.
I need the truth.
I wish I had bought a concert ticket.
I'll give you a ride.
Please give me a day or two.
He might have been sleeping at that time.
That old man caught a large fish.
I'm ready to do anything for you.
Please get out of the way.
Who's in charge of the school kitchen?
I hate silent movies.
Don't get me wrong.
Is this your room?
I decided to stand in line to buy some really cheap eggs.
I read about how to make tempura in a book.
The train got in on time.
It's a small room.
Tom has no desire to get John in trouble.
I can't put up with the noise any longer.
You were the first one here today.
Who is that woman?
The fire went out.
Tom has a very nice smile.
Cheese is made from milk.
He put the book on the desk.
What is she like?
See you soon!
It's frozen solid.
I've never seen a koala in the wild before.
I am accustomed to staying up late.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
I can hardly hear him.
I didn't know that you were seeing someone.
Is this Tom's office?
I barely made the 9:20 train.
The army had plenty of weapons.
Don't get it wrong.
I'll take care of your child tonight.
Do you really speak ten languages?
Let's get off here.
I wonder if he loves me.
You should carry out your promises.
"If you're not watching the TV, turn it off."
She's a glamorous girl.
My bike needs to be repaired.
Where exactly did you go?
Tom laughed in spite of himself.
Tom was unemployed at the time.
Is Tom a handsome guy?
We went by the shop without noticing it.
Be sure to come here by five.
He translated the book from French into English.
How much does it cost to enter?
It looked like everybody was having fun today.
I'd like to cash a travelers' check.
The teacher showed us how to use a computer.
It's too early to get up.
She took up his offer.
I'm afraid of dentists.
I called him this morning.
She was well-dressed.
Be sure to pick up some milk.
I've already told Tom about the problem we're having.
I want my three hundred dollars back.
You'll find the post office on your left.
"If you apply online, it might be faster."
Did you forget to talk to Tom this morning?
My mother is the first one to get up every morning.
Tom wanted to become a sign language interpreter.
My right leg was injured in that accident.
Tom was my only friend in Boston.
I couldn't say no.
I bought bread at the supermarket.
"While we were on holiday, a neighbor took care of our cat."
I wasn't wearing a name tag.
"If you travel by Shinkansen, it doesn't seem far from Nagoya to Tokyo."
The hounds are in pursuit of the fox.
I knelt down.
I know that Tom is a bit older than me.
The ticket is valid until October 20th.
The whale shark feeds on plankton.
Tom isn't scared to die.
I'm going to learn French.
He zipped open his bag.
Let's talk about your trip to Boston.
I began to see what he was getting at.
I don't think there is a doctor here.

Perhaps Tom doesn't speak French.
Please continue with your story. It's really interesting.
I cooked supper last night.
I don't see any reason why I have to apologize.
Tom said that he didn't plan on going back to Australia.
"Tom's favorite Elvis Presley song is ""Jailhouse Rock."""
Whose is this car?
When was the potato introduced into Japan?
I wrote it for her.
Please be careful.
I ironed my handkerchiefs.
That isn't altogether false.
Why didn't you help him?
Is there any chance Tom can win?
Please be my girlfriend.
We'll know the answer before long.
I can't decide which car to buy.
Open your books to page 86.
Tom knows that I hate spinach.
He is my brother.
She'd just begun to read the book when someone knocked on the door.
It's nearly noon and he's still in bed.
It's rumored there are treasures hidden there.
He turned his attention to the picture.
I bought the last one.
Nothing has changed.
He is living apart from his wife.
Tom said he was going to do that tomorrow.
Tom is soaking wet.
It was handcrafted.
"Yes, I made mistakes."
My house is close to a bus stop.
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
She's never fallen in love.
It will snow tomorrow.
Did you bring some warm clothes?
We want something new.
That was a really pretty song.
I thought he wouldn't come.
How far are we from the Canadian border?
You have changed quite a lot.
She is a slow runner.
He is always punctual.
The leak needs to be stopped immediately.
The pond is too shallow for swimming.
We walked along the road.
My camera was stolen on the train.
Please join us.
Be quiet.
I have gained weight.
I'll clean up the kitchen later.
I've already returned the keys.
We get together once a year.
"With your approval, I would like to offer him the job."
I think you're right.
When did your baby start talking?
"I know Tom doesn't like me, but I don't care."
I like my steak medium.
Didn't I lend you some books? I'm sure I did.
I was in the bath when the phone rang.
Have you ever read Milton's works?
Tom isn't a pediatrician.
I like baseball.
She took her own life.
"Tom, are you listening?"
How long does it take to get to Vienna on foot? he inquired.
Sorry I laughed so much.
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I think my right arm is broken.
It's been raining for almost a week.
I've lost my sense of smell and taste.
I haven't had enough to drink yet.
The series of crimes were thought to have been committed by the same man.
Have you tried that store?
Tom asked for help.
I was about to leave when the doorbell rang.
My father was about to leave when the telephone rang.
I can't forgive her.
"I just called Tom, but he didn't answer."
My mother cut the cheese with a knife.
I burned the cake.
It's ten minutes' walk to the station.
War broke out in 1939.
Have you ever been swimming at night?
Are you and Tom in the same class?
"I type faster than Tom, but slower than Mary."
Tom didn't have the courage to ask Mary out.
He adapted his plan to the new situation.
Can foreign students be in the club?
This site is amazing!
"Tom is about thirty, isn't he?"
Tom turned on the light and walked in.
This factory produces toys.
I want to surprise Tom.
Where is that quote from?
It's best to discuss relationship issues directly with your partner.
Who do you think will be chosen?
We study French together.
Oh! Where did Tom go?
Where's the kitchen?
How far is it to Tom's house?
He connected the cord to the machine.
The store is closed Mondays.
I finally talked her into lending me the book.
Who wants to buy a motorcycle with squeaky brakes?
I think you can get it.
Do you live near here?
You may not pass the test.
About how much money do you need?
Do you want to go somewhere?
A window was broken.
It's almost three o'clock.
I'd like to ask you something.
Education aims to develop potential abilities.
Don't be a busybody.
I bought Tom a sweater.
I'm glad that I was able to help.
Could you lend me thirty euros?
I can't ride a bicycle.
Tom laughed at my jokes.
"It was hot, so I went home and took a shower."
Do you mind if I turn off the AC?
I was really nervous.
The date will be determined later.
My father wants me to be a doctor.
Tom didn't think that Mary would kiss him.
It's foggy outside.
It was gambling that brought about his ruin.
The people for the experiment were chosen at random.
I'm telling you this confidentially.
Get over here.
Can you wait?
What subject are you studying?
I found the box empty.
Get out of this house.
That's my own personal opinion.
Are you sure Tom can speak French?
"It's a nice day, isn't it?"
The elephant is the largest land animal.
My eyes itch.
She met him only recently.
Do you think I'm too fat?
You'd better not go out after dark.
He came into the room.
What do you think?
You can adjust the color on the TV by turning this knob.
Nothing can force me to give it up.
I loved that house.
"You really loved Tom, didn't you?"
I'm going to stop you.
I could not attend the meeting.
"Tom's handwriting isn't very good, but it's easy to read."
She didn't intend to argue with him.
Have you ever climbed Mt. Fuji?
Where do I adjust the volume?
I don't care for meat.
The English language is undoubtedly the easiest and at the same time the most efficient means of international communication.
That boy is intelligent.
Just tell me what you'd like me to do.
Let's have our picture taken.
"I've made a reservation at a drinking place near Shinjuku Station. It's all you can drink for 2 hours for 2,500 yen."
"Because of the dense fog, nothing could be seen."
We must work hard to break down social barriers.
Who did you swim with today?
She advised him not to go.
When did you arrive?
I think I've got a touch of fever.
What do you mean by that?
Is there a handling charge?
The treaty did not ban nuclear tests under the ground.
I've just eaten lunch.
It seems Tom's in love with me.
Rice is delicious.
I don't want to eat right now.
"Tom usually wakes up at about six-thirty, but he doesn't usually get out of bed until seven."
I rarely walk to work.
Please wait a bit.
We studied the government's economic policy.
My father stopped drinking.
Does Tom still remember me?
I moved here yesterday.
What would you like for dessert?
Can you play basketball well?
He is very stingy with his money.
The twins look so much alike it's next to impossible to distinguish one from the other.
Tom dyed his hair.
This just might come in handy someday.
Could you show me those photos?
I need to buy fruit and vegetables.
She has no sense of beauty.
I got home at exactly 2:30.
He found that all his efforts amounted to nothing.
I'm glad I make you happy.
"I'm sorry, I have no idea."
Mary isn't my daughter. She's my wife.
Please speak more loudly so everybody can hear you.
You shouldn't speak ill of others.
He plays baseball tomorrow.
I have reached my limits.
Shall we begin?
It was hard for him to live on his small pension.
I've already done everything you've asked me to do.
I'm going to buy a camera for my daughter.
Tom was taken in by Mary's smile.
Go scrub the bathtub.
This company is my life.
The cause of death was a heart attack.
What makes you cry?
"When I woke up, he was gone."
How did the accident happen?
Did you get a text?
Maybe Tom is right.
The reason was unclear.
I visited my friend Tom yesterday.
"When you buy something, examine it carefully before you buy it."
What's her name again?
Tom was afraid he might be expelled from school.
Most likely Tom forgot.
This car is easy to handle.
I consider Tom a friend.
Was Tom on drugs?
We are better off than we used to be.
Tom stuttered as a child.
I could never live in a place this cold.
Sorry to bother you.
You can ask the child who's playing over there.
Would you like white wine or red?
Look at those black clouds.
All knowledge is not good.
I'll call later.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
May I try it on?
Words failed me at the last minute.
Who spilled the soda?
It's frozen solid.
Are there any tickets left for today's concert?
My mother set the table for dinner.
What's the weight of your suitcase?
She's weak by nature.
Love is like the measles. We all have to go through it.
Where in Austria did you grow up?
That's what they're looking for.
It will be dark by the time the police come here.
The last examination was very difficult.
I don't want to go on my own.
Please keep from breaking the eggs.
His life was full of ups and downs.
Is the soup delicious?
What has brought you here?
Tom is a police officer.
Tom seemed satisfied with Mary's answer.
He has no common sense.
There is not much possibility of his coming on time.
Tom is talking to Mary on the phone.
I want you to live more like a human being.
I envy her.
Please take care of yourself.
I bet everything will turn out well.
I don't think it'll affect me.
I haven't yet decided.
Stand up.
"Come on, I'll buy you some ice cream."
We left home early in the morning.
I'll put some salt in the soup.
That's a little strange.
I'm as hungry as a bear.
My son is being toilet trained.
Tom isn't able to speak French.
"Since the sun had set, we all headed home."
I prefer to do it on my own.
Could you come back a little later?
My mother has been learning French for several years.
They're typical young people.
Tom wrote the report all by himself.
What's inside that?
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
This diet is full of vitamins.
He is still here.
He lives at the top of the hill.
Is Tom working today?
May I use your dictionary?
This is a dress that Mary made by herself.
Have you taken your medicine yet?
I think that Tom should stay.
It was very cold this morning.
Let me know if there is anything I can do.
Better late than never.
Tom bullied me.
"If you drink, don't drive. If you drive, don't drink."
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Tsunamis are very rare.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
I can't win.
"In fact, gorillas have many of the same feelings that people have."
Tom returned to his hotel room.
I wonder where he has gone.
Nobody would say that.
I myself have never seen a UFO.
"Read it once more, please."
Do you have a corkscrew?
Do you have a cell phone?
The station is about three miles from here.
Tom didn't think Mary would kiss him.
"If you don't go, I won't either."
I want to be a pianist.
We have only a small garden.
He is an unmanageable child.
There was an intense pain in my head.
This zipper doesn't zip smoothly.
Where is the bathroom?
It'll take at least three hours.
Would it be OK if I sat here?
There is more water than is needed.
Didn't you know that I didn't want to do that?
Charge this to my company.
Tom waited.
She wears a lot of makeup.
I've gotten better.
There are no pens on the desk.
I have only five thousand yen.
You don't have to do that today.
They said there wasn't enough time for a full investigation.
Is Tom also coming?
The young girl hugged Tom.
Go back to your seat.
No one had a flashlight.
"Where are you? ""Over here."""
I'm all thumbs.
My phone's charging.
My bike was stolen last week.
Buy me a snack.
My brother swims well.
My boy can't do addition properly yet.
Koalas are marsupials.
Tom detests Mary.
How many Christmas cards did you send last year?
He practiced every day at home.
It's beautiful out.
I had my wallet stolen.
Was there a fire?
They were biting like crazy yesterday.
Let's try once more.
What a beautiful sunset!
I'm phoning from Tom's.
Put your hands up.
The prisoners were set free.
We must provide for the future.
He was elected chairman.
You can't buy these in Australia.
Tom told me Mary got married last month.
I looked in the cupboard.
We'll stay at a hotel.
I don't want to have children. Is that abnormal?
There were many things in the room.
There were still a few rooms available.
She will have a baby next month.
Come the day after tomorrow.
Have you taken out the garbage?
I'm considering studying in the United States next year.
She is a difficult person to deal with.
Is there someone here who speaks French?
I need your answer before the end of the day.
I'm out of shampoo.
All the apple trees were cut down.
Starlings are social animals.
I should've done this yesterday.
My father didn't say a word during dinner.
The conference was drawing to an end.
Please remain seated until the bus comes to a complete stop.
It's my fault.
I'll treat you.
Grammar is very complicated.
I am thinking about my children.
She revealed the secret to him.
Are you going out this evening?
What kind of place would you like to visit?
I'm not always busy in the morning.
It's a big step.
Don't get in people's way.
That was a great party.
Nobody knows what's going to happen.
I'm not watching TV.
Are you ready for today's exam?
Do you know how to play mahjong?
Possibly the factory will be closed down next week.
He told me that he was busy.
I don't care how you do it. Just do it.
Did you see the news about the earthquake?
Come quickly.
What's in fashion in Paris?
Tom's hair is thick.
"What's your name? ""Tom."""
I also went there.
Where are you going?
My parents want to meet you.
Do you hate Tom that much?
Do you still trust him after he broke his promise twice?
Are Tom and Mary getting back together?
Tom didn't know Mary was in the hospital.
People have two ears.
"You don't pull any punches, do you?"
She was looking forward to seeing him again.
I heard a call for help.
Tom is really rich.
I had fish for dinner last night.
"If it rains tomorrow, we'll go by bus."
I'll get off at the next station.
He is powerful.
It's never too late to learn a foreign language.
"Lemon tea for me, please."
Her story reminded me of the good old days.
Take off your caps.
I didn't buy it.
Seals eat fish.
Knock it off.
"Finally, the shaking stopped."
I haven't yet been to Australia this year.
The wall has a large hole in it.
Tom was able to fix the radio.
We used to go skating every weekend.
She didn't come here to defend herself against these accusations.
She gets up early.
Plastic does not burn easily.
I began to doubt the accuracy of his statement.
That's what we're worried about.
Have you decided on the subject of your thesis?
I don't think it's strange at all.
I'll cancel.
Tom lives in an enormous house.
My mother has a coffee shop.
There are 35 students in this class.
Tom may not be as rich as he seems.
"I started last in the race, but I soon caught up with the others."
"Though he had been in the hospital, he kept up with other students."
I was born in 1980.
He opened his mouth wide.
I will do my best.
What's your zodiac sign?
Keep an eye on this suitcase.
I'm traveling alone.
"If Tom had been wearing a helmet, he wouldn't have been so badly injured."
I eat breakfast every morning.
My father has never gotten sick in his life.
This is a car imported from Germany.
"She has a boyfriend she's been going out with since high school, but she feels their relationship has stagnated, so she's become dissatisfied."
I tried to escape.
I'd like to say a few words by way of apology.
Tom set his alarm clock for 2:30.
She doesn't live with him.
Everything went according to plan.
It was difficult to convince him to cancel the trip.
He is an authority on criminal law.
I must help her at any cost.
I used to swim a lot when I was a kid.
Eat slowly.
Don't chew with your mouth open.
I often catch colds in the winter.
Close the refrigerator.
It was civil of him to offer his seat to the old man.
"Don't drink too much, okay?"
What time is it over there?
Tom broke a window yesterday.
Did you have a nice summer?
Dr. Skeleton is known for his study on ghosts.
I want to let my hair down.
I wonder whether Tom and Mary have both left.
I disagree.
What sights should I see?
"If Tom goes, I won't go."
What did you want?
Are you wearing heels?
I was weak.
Anyone over eighteen years of age counts as an adult.
You're watching TV all the time.
Let me check your ticket.
"Written by hand, the letter was not very easy to read."
It can be cold here even in May.
I'll give you a prescription.
She pressured him to quit.
I'm not worried about that at all.
How do you say that in French?
Tom started yelling.
Twenty years is a long time.
A pair of canaries are her only friends.
It cost three dollars.
Never confuse pity with love.
My parents sent me a postcard.
I'm determined never to give way to temptation.
We're going to have a meeting here tomorrow.
Shame on you.
Don't you sleep well at night?
I'm sorry that I'm unable to attend your party.
Please take off your coat.
There are a lot of people that want to talk to Tom.
Tom won the thumb-wrestling competition.
I don't want my neighbors to know about it.
Words failed her.
You need to take off your shoes before entering.
Sorry for bothering you at this busy time.
I should've studied more when I was young.
It began to drizzle.
I do remember the day very well.
I'll be free next Sunday.
That car belongs to my neighbor.
Please sit down for a moment.
I'd rather live happily in the present than go down in history.
I'd like to drink some tea or coffee.
My strength is all gone.
My purse was stolen on the bus.
Stay home so that you can answer the phone.
Tom hates the sound of wind chimes.
You may give this ticket to whoever wants it.
When can I telephone you?
I'll be waiting for Tom until 6 o'clock.
I can't believe Tom made that kind of mistake.
I mean what I'm saying.
I like instrumental music.
Do earthquakes happen often in Australia?
I'll have my sister pick you up at the station.
Tom refused to follow Mary's advice.
It is important for old people to stay strong.
Nobody speaks French here.
You'd better wait for the next bus.
Practice makes perfect.
Stop your nonsense.
I stayed up all night thinking about the things we said.
I understood absolutely nothing.
He goes abroad every year.
How do I get to your office from Tokyo Station?
"Coffee? ""Is it instant?"" ""Yes."" ""Then no."""
She came home after dark.
It's balmy today.
Your house is big.
"No, thank you. I've had enough."
They didn't wish to go any farther.
"Excuse me, may I try this on?"
I looked at the price tag.
How much does this car cost?
Attach this tag to your suitcase.
That's not much of a problem.
I'm very serious about wanting to be a good magician.
Tom dialed the number again.
It's true that I was madly in love with Mary.
What are you searching for?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
I couldn't go out because of the snow.
I acted as interpreter at the meeting.
We'll do our best.
Tom is my daughter's boyfriend.
My plan failed.
Where are the elevators?
Tom was my boyfriend.
I saw nothing at all.
It's too dark to take pictures here.
School begins tomorrow.
We saw Tom juggling three balls.
Do you charge for delivery?
Don't play catch.
"The bread was moldy, so I threw it away."
Are you interested in sports?
Who's quitting?
I'm leaving now.
I want to stay here for a few days.
We'll do our best.
Tom often cuts classes.
Please refer to page ten.
I'm familiar with the way he asks questions.
I cry every time I listen to this song.
Your cow is eating our flowers.
How is it spelled?
Tom is older.
I'll watch television.
Tom met Mary for the first time three years ago.
One of the aircraft's engines cut out.
It could be fun.
She has a tendency to look on the dark side of things.
The old school building burned down.
What game are you playing?
Now the mountain is hidden by the clouds.
I was confused by her expression.
What are the specials for today?
Have you gotten used to eating Japanese food yet?
Have you heard the news yet?
All of my kids want to learn French.
That's not an illness.
The moon is shining brightly.
I understand that this is a gamble.
It's French.
Please leave next Saturday afternoon free.
I like playing tennis.
No one knew for certain how the accident happened.
Maybe I'm happiest when I'm playing the guitar.
Let's not go.
I had my computer repaired.
Walking to work in this heat isn't a good idea.
I've been here before.
Sit down and talk to me.
Do you still need my assistance?
May I take a shower in the morning?
"I would walk, except it's too hot."
Have you ever heard him sing?
You're to blame.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
He is acquainted with the custom.
How many boys are in this class?
This one is cheaper than that one over there.
The storm prevented us from arriving on time.
Don't cut your finger.
Let's go!
"Had I known that, I wouldn't have come."
Are you volunteering?
I'll get over it somehow.
People tend to raise their voices when they get excited.
I'm sorry that I've kept you waiting so long.
"That's cheap. I'll take ten yards, the girl answered."
"Since Tom will do that, I'll do that, too."
The vending machines are over there.
How long will it be to dinner?
Who cares?
I'll explain how to take this medicine.
Tom's work is sloppy.
Her voice could hardly be heard above the noise.
Tom and Mary ate lunch together.
We arrived here at six yesterday evening.
I paid five dollars for the book.
I really appreciate what you've done.
Do you have a plan?
I think that Tom made a mistake.
I wonder if Tom is married.
Let's begin.
The plane flew over Mt. Fuji.
I was poor.
The meeting was canceled.
Tom kissed Mary on the neck.
Nothing happened.
I will pick you up around six.
Mary isn't my type.
My father never looked down on the poor.
Tom was really lucky.
Tom asked me a question.
I don't know when my mother will come back.
He tipped his hat.
Tom has a good head on his shoulders.
Do you have an airplane ticket back home?
"Tom and I pushed the car as hard as we could, but it wouldn't budge."
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood.
You don't look so well.
He was always drinking in those days.
This tree is about as tall as that one.
We kissed without saying a word.
Let's change the topic.
Don't open the window.
Could I have a spoon?
I used to be a waiter at a fancy restaurant.
Were you surprised?
Tom tried to remain calm.
They were not aware that I was not there.
I have nothing to do with them.
My boyfriend has a lot of female friends.
I'm a very slower walker.
You have a lovely voice.
I got up earlier than usual in order to catch the first train.
Do you like swimming?
"That's just silly, don't you think?"
I wasn't able to pick up Tom at the airport.
She helped the old man across the street.
I got up early yesterday.
I watched the baseball game last night.
I don't like my voice.
I can understand it.
Tom tested positive for COVID-19.
You've dropped your wallet.
Do you know what your children are doing right now?
I already knew it.
What do you want to be?
This sofa is uncomfortable.
That sounds very tempting.
I learned a lot from you.
Tom always gets lost if he doesn't carry a map.
I'll go with you as far as the bridge.
I will act on your advice.
I've moved to Boston.
History deals with the past.
It's a beautiful day.
All is well that ends well.
Our train is late.
The boy talks as if he were a man.
Tom seldom smiles.
I prefer modern furniture.
We had a secret meeting.
He prepared supper by himself.
When do you like to do that?
I'm feeling blue today.
The restaurant is full.
Please take a seat.
Do you know this word?
They have nothing in common with the older generation.
Christmas is coming soon.
I know that you're very busy.
Tom is reading.
There are so many houses here.
The soap bubble burst.
I haven't eaten anything in the past three days.
I'll go eat lunch and then come back.
Tom pulled a flashlight out of his jacket pocket.
I'm expecting my baby in the middle of January.
It'll be quicker to walk than to take a taxi.
She declined the invitation.
We have lots of things to do.
Do you really think Tom is wrong?
They addressed me as doctor.
Tom did that twice.
I had to stay in bed all day.
Don't tell me that.
The station is to the west of the hotel.
Don't start yet.
That's a useful piece of information.
I hate hospital food.
We're almost there.
She picked up beautiful stones.
I was late to school.
Tell me what you did in Tokyo.
Tom kicked open the door.
I read my horoscope every day.
Where's my other sock?
I met him last week for the first time in ages.
They were lying on the grass.
She was out when I called.
I'll check my schedule.
Why does it cost so much to do this?
Blood is thicker than water.
We traveled on foot.
Show me how to do it.
Mary is Tom's daughter who lives in Boston.
A good idea came across my mind.
Tom and I go to the same high school.
This book is boring.
"Tom did it, didn't he?"
Tom is a brain surgeon.
"Excuse me, would you show me how to use the washing machine?"
You know why we're here.
I know that you're here.
Tom is almost always correct.
I'd like to master English.
"A group of foreigners arrived in Edo, in other words Tokyo."
"Excuse me, where's the elevator?"
Let's read Lesson 3.
We don't get along with each other.
I speak fast.
Please teach me how to do that.
Tom seemed to hate me.
Do you still need tea?
I eat breakfast every day.
"Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it."
He screamed for help.
Tom's death was confirmed yesterday.
An old man lay dead on the road.
What were you doing in Boston?
"Tom is already asleep, isn't he?"
What are you driving at?
Is that a new tie?
"Eventually, he forgot about the incident."
Cats have nine lives.
Write your answer on the whiteboard.
Tom and Mary are a match made in heaven.
Can I go home early today?
"While there's life, there's hope."
Tom is against hiring Mary.
I don't watch movies on my computer.
They entered into a discussion.
Did you turn the stove off?
Is there someone here who speaks French?
He continued singing.
Exams are right after summer vacation.
It is too late.
Are there any rooms available?
How many chairs do we need?
When would be convenient for you?
Your French pronunciation is terrible.
They are about the same age.
Try on this new suit to see if it fits well.
He married for money.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
He was accused of murder.
"Tom, do you think I'm a good person?"
Tom is reading a short story.
The chimney needs to be cleaned.
The door would not open.
Tom is babysitting.
Even a child can do it.
"Yes, I'm the person who called you last night."
It was cloudy yesterday.
"Entering the house, I tripped over the mat."
I just can't remember how to do it.
I need some volunteers.
I go to bed at eleven.
We should've made a careful plan in advance.
Go exercise outside.
What surprised me most about that accident is how fast the lawyers arrived on the scene.
What's the name of the store where you bought that?
Is it true Tom went to Boston?
Tom used an old postcard as a bookmark.
"When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus had already left."
I'll ask Tom about it.
"Is that Tom calling again? ""Yes. He calls every evening these days. I shouldn't have given him my number."""
May his soul rest in peace.
What do you have for breakfast?
It doesn't fit here.
How is your family doing?
How dare you speak to me like that!
It's under the table.
I remember seeing him once.
That dog barks at strangers.
Spring is just around the corner.
I'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow.
You can have this book for nothing.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I hate this weather.
I hope it's fine tomorrow.
This is Tom's school.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
Do you know what kind of books Tom likes to read?
It was believed that the sun went around the earth.
He likes animals.
I was born the year the war ended.
I don't have enough money for a taxi.
I've bought some cream puffs. Do you want one?
Cornstarch is good for thickening soup.
I eat sauerkraut every morning.
He turned up an hour later.
I think Tom is lucky.
She's fond of taking pictures.
Don't get mad.
Education is an investment in the future.
I'm not good with kids.
My computer froze again.
I know her.
I was very surprised when Tom told me Mary had left Boston.
I was wondering if you could give me a lift.
We turned on the radio.
I use a dictionary when I don't understand the meaning of words.
I fell down the stairs.
Do you usually drink a lot of beer?
Wait here.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Tom gave a rose to Mary.
I can't bear it any longer.
I would love to see it.
Tom found his keys under the sofa.
My mother likes cooking.
Come back.
Where did you buy the bread?
I'm not the person I used to be.
Mary is a really good-looking woman.
He is having lunch now.
I'm awfully afraid of heights.
This book looks interesting.
I want to have my own room.
I found the missing bicycle.
"When I saw the picture, I remembered the story."
I don't eat green peppers at all.
We will notify you in advance.
Have you finished your homework?
Were Tom and Mary both born in Boston?
Tom and I went to the same high school.
Was Tom lost?
I want to go to America some day.
I'm not as young as I used to be.
You'll find the way all right once you get to the station.
Do you know why he skipped class today?
She got over the shock of her father's death.
The kittens are chasing each other around the house.
Are all the doors shut?
Our streets flood when we have rain.
How much sleep do you usually get?
She's unfit for the job.
Let's go to a Japanese restaurant.
Raisins are dried grapes.
Please wait until tomorrow morning.
Tom spent the last years of his life in Boston.
Have you read any interesting books lately?
Mary stayed up late last night.
Are you leaving today?
I forgot to close the windows.
Can this dog swim?
Tom was not seriously injured.
The store might be closed already.
I said nothing about the matter.
Have you washed the dishes?
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
This bird can imitate the human voice.
I'll see you next Wednesday.
How many nights will you stay?
"According to the weather forecast, it'll snow tomorrow."
What's Tom's favorite food?
There was a big fire last night.
I went to Boston for 5 days on a business trip.
My father always speaks in a very loud voice.
Are you hurt?
I forgot what I was about to say.
I will leave it to your judgement.
I found my credit card that I thought I'd lost.
My older brother was treated like a dog.
Please come in and make yourself at home.
Tom broke the window.
"I'm putting myself through school, so I can't have things that are that expensive."
It snowed from Monday to Friday.
There's a flower shop near by.
"I moved closer, so I could hear better."
I don't like sand.
"As he talked, he got more and more excited."
You're still green.
We're staying with Tom.
I don't have enough money to buy a second home.
We are going to climb that mountain.
I'm speaking to you as a friend.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
I thought that you might want to play a game of chess.
I didn't have breakfast this morning.
That's a lovely idea.
I tried to change the topic as quickly as possible.
She choked him.
There's someone I'm interested in.
I think I'll order some takeout.
How much money did you find?
I'm pleased with my new bathing suit.
Is there someone here that speaks French?
I wish to go to Hawaii.
Please let me know as soon as it's decided.
She left me simply because I had a small income.
You have cancer.
May I have a glass of water?
I trust Tom completely.
"That teacher sometimes hits his students, but no one complains."
"Tomorrow, I'll return the money you lent me."
Were you home last night?
Happy New Year!
He's a DJ.
I wanted a younger brother.
The egg is cracked.
He got off at the next bus stop.
It'd be better if you didn't see my grandpa today.
"If it's not raining tomorrow, I might work in the garden."
Will you give me a drink?
Keep in touch.
I hope your wish will come true.
Where am I right now?
She was unable to completely give up her dream of traveling abroad.
You should've gone there by yourself.
Who are these people?
Don't forget to take the first-aid kit.
I was at a loss for words.
I agree with you on this point.
"Tom has never dated a girl whose name ends with an ""s."""
Tom was in a good mood.
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
Did Tom actually do that by himself?
We painted the house green.
Tell me the truth.
I caught a fly.
The ship sank to the bottom of the sea.
We'll call you when your table is ready.
Let's forget what happened yesterday.
He took out some coins.
My mother bought me the book.
My joke went over very well.
My friends will be here at any moment.
There's not much difference between the two.
"Tom wasn't thirsty, but Mary was."
I'm now at Tom's house.
I lucked out.
We were worried.
Is Tom kidding?
It's simple and intuitive.
What's going on with you two?
"If Tom calls, tell him I'm taking a nap."
Everything's great.
This is really delicious.
I've lost a lot of weight since I started my diet.
How about 12:45?
I was moved to tears by the story.
"Would you pass the salt, please?"
Tom likes Mary more than he likes Alice.
She hurt her elbow when she fell down.
I think you should apologize to Tom.
"You'll have to do it, whether you like it or not."
Tom is the last person I want to see now.
I don't remember where I put my key.
Tom was secretly very excited.
Was it hard for you to find my house?
Please wait until the end of this month.
Would you lend me your pen?
Do what you want.
People don't usually swim around here. The water's not too clean.
She was run over by a car.
Please leave the windows open.
I cannot afford a holiday.
I hate ironing.
This hall holds two thousand people.
"I'm going shopping. Do you want to come with me? ""Yes."""
You can call us at any time.
I missed the last train last Friday.
I'll take this coat.
What are you doing?
My dentist recommend that I chew sugarless gum.
Can you tell me how to fill in this form?
I thought that it was Tom's.
"My uncle is slim, but my aunt is fat."
Tom thought that Mary had a car.
This bread is fresh from the oven.
I have no particular reason to do so.
"He says that he saw nothing. However, I don't believe what he says is the truth."
She is carrying a backpack on her back.
Would you like ice?
Tom's filthy.
A glass of water will do you good.
I'm not strong enough to go to school yet.
Why did you lend money to someone like him?
Is that right?
There's a nice Thai restaurant near here.
My house is a mess.
I'll make use of this opportunity.
I left you a note.
I remember the sound of your laugh.
French is my native language.
There was a light rain yesterday.
Nothing is achieved without effort.
Are you ready for the truth?
He said he'll help us.
Do you know this man in the picture?
A true gentleman never betrays his friends.
Why don't we take a little break?
That isn't altogether false.
It is difficult to know oneself.
He may come today.
The recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
How can I get to the police station?
I don't care.
The price of rice is going up again.
Tom should relax.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
Nowadays more and more people prefer country life to city life.
I have a terrible pain.
What kind of cheese do you usually eat when you drink red wine?
Come out with your hands up.
It's still damp.
I saw him three years ago.
Tom didn't sound as if he was in trouble.
Nagoya is famous for its castle.
I am anxious about your health.
Could you tell me the way to Tokyo Tower?
I love to eat.

I'm afraid to go.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it gets warmer.
That American professor knows a good deal about Kyoto.
I got to know Tom through one of my friends.
"You can't beat me, Tom. I've been playing tennis since I was a kid."
Which of the two do you think is right?
Are you going to Tom's party tonight?
I didn't fall asleep until after 2 o'clock in the morning.
It's bad manners to eat on trains and buses in Japan.
Did anybody call for security?
A gas station is one kilometer ahead.
I used to play with a couple of boys.
Competition for the position is very intense.
I like apples.
I wanted to marry Mary.
They all tried to talk at one time.
There are many old temples in Kyoto.
Do you want a ride?
I said no.
Tom is better at the piano than I am.
You must eat properly to keep up your strength.
That was fabulous.
Tom sat up slowly.
Tom got off to a good start.
I competed with him for the first prize.
Anybody can do that.
I applied for a visa.
"One, three, and five are odd numbers."
The medicine tastes bitter.
I quickly ate lunch.
Tom is quick to lose his temper.
It is no laughing matter.
Stop asking stupid questions.
I wish I were taller.
You should go home early.
"If you don't want to help, just say so."
Come home.
It's over three kilometers from here.
"Weather permitting, we will go on a picnic tomorrow."
Where's the bathroom?
The doors were closed.
I don't know if we can get tickets today.
Tom is sending a fax.
Tom doesn't think Mary is going to win.
"Tom tried opening the door, but it was locked."
We'll leave without Tom.
Stop ordering me around.
More than twenty boys went there.
I overslept because I stayed up late.
I can't draw a bird.
There aren't any chairs in this room.
Two seats were vacant.
I got soaked to the skin.
Were Tom and Mary both in class today?
"What would you do in a situation like this, Tom?"
Tom suddenly realized that he wasn't alone.
Our names are the same.
"Atoms are composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons."
Tom intends to live in Boston for more than a year.
I found the book you were looking for.
They got off at the next bus stop.
Tom is a spoiled brat.
Call me at 9:00 tomorrow.
We jog before breakfast every morning.
You looked like you were enjoying yourself.
Tom got released from prison three months ago.
You shouldn't impose your opinion on others.
I spent all morning writing letters.
Do you believe in UFOs?
I went out for a walk.
She speaks relatively fast.
I have to leave now.
They moved ahead slowly.
No minors allowed.
I often have ear infections.
Nobody was there except for Tom.
I should've listened to Tom.
We're in the same boat.
How did you find my house?
I think that you're correct.
Tom can imitate that singer perfectly.
Our head office is in Boston.
It is impossible to live without water.
"Tom is still in the house, isn't he?"
"To make a long story short, we got married."
Would you dine with me?
My mother was in tears.
It was a small and unremarkable bakery.
Zip your lips.
The earthquake caused widespread damage.
I disposed of my old coat.
I think you need to think about the future.
The planes arrived one after another.
Many thanks.
I'm sick of seeing pop-up ads.
How many English words do you know?
I'm short of money.
That's convenient.
My body aches all over.
It rained gently the whole day.
I like playing golf.
I need to see you right now.
Tom can't tie his own shoes yet.
There is a lake in front of my house.
I'm looking for a gym suit for my sister.
A computer is a complex machine.
I had a strange dream last night.
Mary is a stay-at-home mom.
Tom just wants you to take care of his dog.
"On the whole, I agree with you."
I don't see any problem with that.
She doesn't seem to be an American.
She was very shy until she graduated.
Will you have another slice of pie?
Please go up to the third floor.
"Does your throat hurt? ""Yes, a little."""
What does it contain?
You should apologize to your father for not getting home in time for dinner.
Tom might know who Mary is married to.
"Turn down the volume, please."
Tom is a buddy of mine.
We elected her captain of our team.
What's your job?
Tom got married to an older woman.
Tom hasn't met Mary even once.
Which are the prime numbers?
Ask her if she'll sew up the hole in your jeans.
She's the most beautiful woman in the whole world.
Keep quiet!
Can you tell me what this word means?
Would you mind translating this into French for me?
Sugar isn't good for your health.
"No matter who comes, don't open the door."
Show me the photo.
We always eat breakfast in the kitchen.
This tooth hurts.
He saw the accident on the way to school.
"No, it's not spicy."
Our train went through a long tunnel.
I haven't heard from him for a long time.
Where does your grandpa live?
She passed away peacefully last night.
Tom and Mary seldom talk about money.
There was a large crowd in the park.
"It's hot, so I want to eat something cold."
"If one has the right to live, then one should also have the right to die. If not, then living is not a right, but an obligation."
Have you met any of Tom's friends?
I think that he is right.
Tom sent me a postcard.
I keep a diary in French.
My mother made a birthday cake for me.
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.
"Speak up, Tom."
I'll bring sandwiches.
His wife is French.
You'll be able to speak French better if you practice hard.
I have to hand in my report by next Wednesday.
I take a nap almost every day.
Tom was right behind Mary.
There are twelve months in a year.
There are lots of things to do in Boston.
I sometimes help my parents in the shop after school.
There were six sheep in the field.
This is my fiancé.
It's what I want.
I'm taking a bath now.
Tom is going to pick me up after school.
It looks unhealthy.
Were you following me?
Tom waited patiently.
"If it doesn't work, let me know."
One who is not willing to learn is not worth teaching.
"I am allowed 1,000 yen a month for books."
Adding comments makes reading the code easier.
We had a lot of snow last year.
Forget your sorrows.
Thank you for helping me correct the situation.
We all believe in you.
He took a job with an insurance company.
He decided on a red car.
He is one of my old friends.
She added in her letter that she would write again soon.
She asked me a question.
I was having a bath when the telephone rang.
Tom had a relieved expression on his face.
The submarine's periscope was sticking out of the water.
I made some mistakes on the test.
Where are you off to?
It's a common symptom.
What are you talking about?
Have you ever heard him sing?
The bread was still warm.
What kind of book are you reading?
My back is killing me.
It isn't cold in the house.
I compared my car with his.
I guess I'll have to think it over.
I couldn't help but laugh when I saw it.
She flatters herself by thinking that she is beautiful.
Tom can't go anywhere right now.

"You must do the work, even if you do not like it."
Give me a day or two.
Tom is a mama's boy.
Thank you very much.
There was a suggestion of anger in his voice.
You tricked me.
Cover your eye like this please.
Don't get so angry.
This city has a big TV station.
Olive oil is extracted from olives.
Come here at six o'clock sharp.
Tom didn't have children.
He becomes a university student this year.
I'd like to become a good conversationalist.
Why do you want my help?
He works as hard as any other student.
Are there any direct flights between Boston and Sydney?
He is a methodical person.
What are you trying to say?
The situation is hopeless.
Did you brush your teeth?
I don't want to speak with you.
You'd better keep an eye on Tom.
I've decided to study as hard as I can.
He used the dictionary.
"I have to stop you from doing that. ""Stop me from doing what?"""
I have enough money to buy this book.
He's studying hard so he can pass the entrance exam.
"The food in the cafeteria is cheap, and it's delicious."
The meaning doesn't change.
You should tell Tom that you can't do that.

My teacher wrote a recommendation for me.
Cats are cute.
Please give me your real name.

"When I go on vacation, I'll rent a car."
Tom showed me how to do this.
Is it legal?
Please show your ticket.
I've been as busy as a bee for the past two months.
Should I take the bus?
The teacher can't have said such a thing.
She lacks common sense.
These items are rather hard to obtain.
The room is crawling with spiders.
May I use this?
Tom was looking for a vending machine.
Are you going to meet Tom tonight?
That's a good plan.
Tom has decided to buy a motorcycle.

Swallows are flying in the sky.
Welcome.
He made a speech in front of many people.
I suppose Tom told you that.
You made the right call.
I think Tom can do it.
The population has doubled in the last five years.
She is not a good person.
A dog is running in the park.
Tom is smashed.
I wish I could stay home.
The game was called off on account of the rain.
Turn the knob clockwise.
Twelve years is old for a dog.
Did you go anywhere for the summer?
I'd like to have my blood examined.
Why isn't anyone eating?
Tom seemed to know everything.
Look at the picture at the top of the page.
I've changed my job.
I don't really remember.
Tom's dog never barks.
You don't have to do it now.
Tom wants to go somewhere else.
"Which is larger, the sun or the earth?"
I was sick a lot when I was a kid.
Tom is shorter than me.
This CD belongs to her.
Tom can speak French almost as well as you and I can.

Can you swim underwater?
Will I get what I want?
Can you remember what we're supposed to do?

Open up.
Say hi to Tom.
I read about it in the paper.
I loved studying French.
Tom was in a very good mood.
There must be something wrong with the machine.
Tom cried until he ran out of tears.
The tree was struck by lightning.
Never ever do this again.
He will pass the next examination.
"Excuse me, how much does this cost?"
That fact can't be denied.

Have you ever visited someone in prison?
That winter was unusually mild.
She made him clean his room.
How can I get to the third floor?
I heard someone scream.
"Apparently, Tom had a lot on his mind, so I just left him alone."
I play the piano a little.
People believe what they see.
What are you going to do?
Have a nice weekend!
"You are a good cook, aren't you?"
I have to clean the house.
You don't have to reply today.
My life is empty without you.
Don't worry. I'll remember.
You have no idea who I am.
"The climate here is very mild, so it seldom snows here even in the winter."
"Honey, are you hurt?"
He has worked in this factory for 11 years.
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
"Tom is musically talented, too."
Are they all the same?

"If you could wait until tomorrow, I could go with you."
I think of you all the time.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
Why aren't you a Muslim?
Tom was all wet.
This is the first time for me to read the Bible.
What do you want?
That's how it is.
"Sit back down, please."
Tom came near being hit by a car.
Tom told me I shouldn't talk to you.
What did you go there for?
"No matter what he says, don't trust him."
Tom was on the verge of tears.
Few people can buy such an expensive car.
You can get there in less than thirty minutes.
Tom went into the bar.
He is about your age.
The heavy snow kept us from going out.
Her feelings are easily wounded.
How much for the cheese?
Your shirt is inside out.
School begins at nine.
He is about my age.
I'll do it myself.
Turn the volume up.
Mary was wearing high heels.
Keep it up!
Your mother must've been beautiful when she was young.
I wouldn't say it like that.
I did it already.
"Tom lives in Boston, and Mary lives in Chicago."
The room was so smoky I could hardly breathe.
You may choose whichever book you like.
Tom studies French every morning.
She got up at seven in the morning.
I wish I had bought a ticket for the concert.
"Move your car, please."
I know some of these boys.
What's the good news?
You dropped your pencil.
You have to break an egg to make an omelet.
I don't want to talk to Tom.
Are all the books on the table?
Is Tom in Boston already?
I've already spent all my money.
I've fixed it.
I didn't feel like playing golf today.
It became a habit.
He has a natural bent for music.
"Every morning, I wake up before dawn."
I was talking about Tom.
You didn't need to hurry.
I thought you said that you used to live in Boston.
There is a book on the desk.
Let me handle this.
I wish I could've gone swimming.
You shouldn't judge a person by his looks.
Tom arrived precisely on time.
What season do you like the best?
This train is bound for Boston.
The rain washed away the soil.
When does the show start?
My guess is that it'll rain soon.
I asked for a seat in the no-smoking section.
"Give me a glass of water, please."
Koalas are cute.
I usually don't speak French at work.
May I speak to you for a moment?
"He hung an old, wooden oar on his wall as a decoration."
Tom asked his girlfriend to pardon him for forgetting her birthday.
"Suddenly, the light went out."
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston.
What time shall we meet tomorrow?
"If you could only speak English, you would be perfect."
Are you a new teacher?
I'm living in Boston.
My mother made me a white dress.
Tom tried to do that same thing that Mary was doing.
"Why didn't you tell me? ""You never asked."""
I bought Tom a present.
Tom isn't angry anymore.
Tom sat down on the couch.
He hurried to the house only to be disappointed to find that it was empty.
They're all alike.
The woman sitting over there is his present wife.
Just brush your hair.
Tom was afraid that he might get expelled from school.
Work is behind schedule.
Where is the boarding gate for UA 111?
Mary came in.
She's still young.
I don't want to play chess.
That's a beautiful sword.
Were you two close?
I have a book in my hand.
This is such an easy problem that any student can solve it.
I thought that you didn't know anything about lacrosse.
He doesn't mince words.
He is distantly related to her.
I have eaten a lot this morning.
Tom is very worried about you.
The world is on the brink of destruction.
I translated the contract into French.
The sun was burning in the sky.
She is going to have a baby.
Count on me.
I will be back in two weeks' time.
Tom wasn't our interpreter. He was our tour guide.
Tom is dating an exchange student from China.
Turn your face this way.
I wish I were in the same school as Tom.
I can't put up with Tom.
Tom looked like he was displeased.
Please tell me how to get to the bank.
Are you good at mathematics?
Is this wine?
"If your rent comes in past the fifth, a late charge will be added."
I can't say anything now.
Did you behave today?
"Which comes first, your career or your family?"
I was absent from school yesterday.
That's a pretty strong statement.
Do you have a pair of dice?
Chew your food with your mouth closed.
I look forward to seeing you again very soon.
A four-by-four will usually have much worse gas mileage than a compact.
We use words in order to communicate.
"To be honest, I'm afraid of Tom."
Why don't you like girls?
"If Tom calls, wake me up."
This offer is good for five days.
I got my pay yesterday.
Tom lives next door to Mary.
I was working last night.
The TV was so noisy that I couldn't concentrate on my reading.
There's no way we'll be able to win.
Come tomorrow morning.
I had lunch with a friend.
Those people are speaking French.
We don't have any strawberry ice cream.
I felt as if I were an uninvited guest.
I don't want you fighting over me.
Tom drives a sports car.
I don't drink red wine.
Did you receive the email I sent you?
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I helped her hang the picture on the wall.
He is on the point of death.
I don't know when he'll come back.
The rainy season began early this year.
"In case of fire, dial 119."
Are there a lot of guns?
It's still too early to get up.
That wasn't my intention.
I don't care for him.
I have few English books.
My house is only a mile from here.
A trickle of blood ran down his neck.
Where is Boston?
Would you please tell me what I should do next?
What were you doing then?
Are banks open on Monday?
The storm did heavy damage to the crops.
It's perfect.
The stories in this book are really scary.
I agree.
Is that true?
She's always smiling.
I have already eaten lunch.
She applied for a visa.
I think that it might rain.
I should have listened to Tom.
The fog began to disappear around ten o'clock.
Each cat has its own personality.
Show it to me.
Tom dried his hands with the towel Mary gave him.
This book is even more interesting than that.
How much is a ticket to Boston?
I feed meat to my dog.
This city has a big TV station.
"She tried to lift the box, but found it impossible to do."
Has Tom ever tried doing that?
My nose is running.
She's very fond of flowers.
"If you eat too much, you'll become fat."
I won't change my mind.
"Have you eaten? ""Yes, I have."""
I wanted to go there.
I am going to buy a new car.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
This guy is dead.
Is Boston very far away?
Your son must be quite tall by now.
I heard the phone ring.
Are there bears around here?
What would you do if it was raining?
The door just won't open.
I'm afraid I'll make a mistake.
Can I use your phone?
He has lost his father's watch.
I'll go and see what the kids are doing.
The station is on the right.
I don't think I could've done this without you.
The performance was almost over.
I'll kick your butt!
Tom didn't take his sunglasses off.
I heard Tom went to Boston.
Listening to music is lots of fun.
She has been absent since last Wednesday.
Tom still hasn't washed his clothes.
Cheese is made from milk.
A mother rabbit keeps her babies warm with her own body.
Tom isn't in.
The investigation is ongoing.
Do you want a boiled egg for breakfast?
It's your turn to answer the question.
I'm used to the noise.
I've already eaten breakfast.
What time did you get up this morning?
Nobody was in the park.
She studies as hard as ever.
We couldn't go out because of the storm.
Tom eats instant ramen every day.
I'm six feet tall.
Tom quit smoking.
Are you thinking about Tom?
I need to talk to you.
I think they're beautiful.
Did you not go out?
They say that he's still alive.
"I'll get even with you, if it takes me the rest of my life."
I didn't spend a penny.
There's a fish.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
I admire his talent.
Not a day goes by when I don't think of you.
The dam was completed in 2013.
The test was too hard for me.
Crimes sometimes result from ignorance of the law.
Tom showed off his new mobile phone.
This chair is light.
Don't call him names.
"My mother is strict, but my father isn't."
I couldn't help laughing.
Everyone has their own style.
Tom grabbed his coat.
Every man should learn how to cook.
You'd better see a doctor at once.
He left without saying goodbye.
Where's the nearest bus stop?
I never thought I'd see you in a place like this.
Tom spent all day taking pictures.
He was in favor of the proposition.
"If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you live?"
Was the baby crying then?
I think it'll rain today.
The twins are very much alike.
Are you going to buy the car?
Tom has a distinctive scar under his right eye.
It would be better to stay home today.
He got the sack for slacking off at work.
I make it a point to shine my shoes before I go to bed.
What do you make of this?
I won't follow you.
I'll call you back later.
We were rich at the time.
The desire to fly in the sky like a bird inspired the invention of the airplane.
The puppy tried to bite my hand.
Tom is studying in the library now.
What is happiness?
I go to church every day.
I admit Tom was right.
Our school begins at eight-thirty.
Why don't we eat?
I had a strange dream last night.
"On a clear day, we can see Mt. Fuji in the distance."
I want to go back.
Where did you buy it?
What kind of wine do you have?
Come with us.
She is used to cooking.
Is it all right to use a flash here?
How did Tom become a billionaire?
Hold on.
My father doesn't waste his time.
"Actually, it was my mistake."
I taught Tom's children French.
These eggs are not all fresh.
The building was completely destroyed by the earthquake.
I want to buy a piggy bank for Tom.
I have some stamps in my bag.
I had a little fever.
Is it safe to eat moldy cheese?
I'm planning to buy a new car.
This order is to be obeyed to the letter.
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
He had his share of luck.
I went to the airport to see them off.
This song is catchy.
The bus stop is across the street.
He likes to watch the birds fly above his head.
The lock must be broken.
"She's overreacting, isn't she?"
When did you get up?
I finally got a driver's license.
The two men were arrested for reckless driving.
I can speak a little French.
He is about to leave for London.
You can't trust anything he says.
There's nothing I like as much as the smell of roses.
"Unfortunately, I'm not much of a dancer."
My father takes a walk every morning.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
His dream came true.
What would you like to drink?
Are you already in Boston?
Sometimes it's enough simply to nod in response.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Hand me my mug.
"She said she was ill in bed, which was a lie."
Tom purchased a pistol.
All of us play the piano.
Thank you for the other day.
I cried all night.
I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
Tom and Mary live in a very small apartment.
"Tom is a control freak, isn't he?"
"Frankly speaking, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher."
It'll soon be spring.
I still haven't decided whether to go by car or by train.
"If today was your last day on Earth, what would you like to eat?"
Don't get close to me.
It concerns all the people living there.
He was made to go there.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
Are you going to attend the meeting?
You should be able to walk in a few days.
Were you asleep?
We're a bit busy at the moment. Can you hang on a minute?
The monkey ate my banana.
Honesty will pay in the long run.
We want Tom to be silent.
I'll be doing my homework.
"Turn the page, please."
Don't be so stingy.
Do you know who wrote this book?
Who sang this song?
I can't get the lid off.
It'll take an hour to get there.
Tom is wearing a blue hat.
I can hear your voice.
I'm looking for a bag for my wife.
I use it.
Apple trees have beautiful blossoms.
We didn't need to hurry.
I thought I told you not to do that anymore.
I think you'll be a great father.
Am I handsome or not?
"No matter what I did, no one paid any attention to me."
I like English better than music.
"If it hadn't been for Tom's help, I'd have failed."
He seems to be in a slump.
Tom is making boiled eggs.
Have you ever donated blood?
It wasn't exactly a piece of cake.
That was a very good day.
"Tom is Mary's brother, not her father."
He was not aware of the danger.
"No, it's not hot."
I thought that a game of tennis might be fun.
He is leaving in three days.
Don't get so emotional.
Both girls wear white suits.
Tom is usually with his friends.
"Tom is quiet, isn't he?"
I wish I could be as cool as you.
The museum is closed on Mondays.
She majors in French literature.
I heard you were looking for a babysitter.
What's the name of this village?
I don't like this type of house.
I've become very sleepy.
He looks exactly like his older brother.
Don't speak so fast.
You have made all my dreams come true.
Your hands are filthy.
Have I mentioned this before?
Tom deserves to be blamed.
How much is the handling charge?
"That day, Tom bought as many cameras as he could afford."
Please lock the door when you leave.
Won't you give me something cold to drink?
I think maybe Tom was right.
Did you eat an apple today?
I think it'll rain today.
What did Tom say he lost?
What is the width of this street?
Can you come and pick me up?
Tom doesn't watch the news.
Do you know what you're saying?
The library is in the center of the city.
He was puzzled by the question.
The tree was ready to fall down.
I asked her to wait a moment.
I don't cry easily.
The bus was empty.
He survived the accident.
I don't care what you say. It's not going to happen!
The stadium is accessible by bus.
What's that smell?
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Girls mature faster than boys.
Study hard.
I can't make out what the man is saying.
He's a bit shy.
Please help yourself to the salad.
I have no time for reading.
Thanks for the hint.
This isn't a joke.
My father is a doctor.
"If there's anything urgent, you can get in touch with me."
They love each other deeply.
Tom seldom travels.
I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.
Some people were hanging around at the entrance.
As soon as it stopped raining a beautiful rainbow appeared.
It took me some time to calm down.
I saw him leaving the hotel.
I've seen a panda once.
Is there anybody who knows first aid?
Do you want to go on a trip with me?
How long have you been wearing contacts?
Why were you late?
I feel like eating something.
The old chair groaned under her weight.
Everybody falls in love at least once in their lives.
Everyone except me was invited.
Our school did away with uniforms last year.
I wake up every morning before dawn.
"I'll be there, although I may be late."
My father died four years ago.
I can play the guitar.
"If you'd left earlier, you would've caught the train."
I'm at Tom's house.
I confessed.
Is Tom lonely?
I'll call you as soon as I get to Boston.
"Your memory is as good as mine, I think."
"When you wake up tomorrow morning, you will find a wonderful thing."
Ask Tom if he can understand French.
He raised his hand to ask a question.
Tom hasn't arrived yet.
You don't have to come here.
I'd prefer not to comment on that now.
Tom is an introverted person.
Would you mind doing the laundry?
Let's finish this work as soon as possible.
Tom says he's not lazy.
I hope your efforts will bear fruit.
They pitched their tents on the beach.
Don't trust him.
Please wait five minutes.
That's a tower.
I can no more swim than I can fly.
"Tom has a funny way of laughing, doesn't he?"
Tom is almost always right.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'd like a salami sandwich.
I don't have a cat.
I normally wear skirts.
He stayed at the hotel for two days.
Someone stole my cash.
I stopped smoking.
What's in your trunk?
You cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs.
Tom's room was very clean.
Please turn down the volume a little bit more.
I won first prize.
"Hi, Tom. How are you?"
They agreed to start early.
What time do you usually eat breakfast?
The day is sure to come when your dream will come true.
Tom gives his kids an allowance.
We need money to do anything.
Is there anything else that you want to know?
How many elevators are in this building?
We're housesitting.
I'm sorry that I disappointed you.
They don't believe me.
I don't mind getting up at six.
She was locked up in a room.
You can solve the problem in nonviolent ways.
Let me get that for you.
I'd like to have some hot chocolate.
I can wait.
Get your dirty paws off me.
I'd like to know the exact time.
I can't understand what you're trying to get at.
I make it a rule never to eat between meals.
Do you have any brothers?
He was tired from his long walk.
Even a child can understand that.

Why do bears hibernate?
They say that he hates to study.
How is your family?
Eat up all your spinach!
I have a bad pain in my lower back.
The ship set sail.
"Since our father is bedridden, we take turns looking after him."
She was clinging to her father.
Where are your keys?
Stay still.
What're you looking at?
Tom knows a few magic tricks.
We are about to leave here.
I'm not used to being laughed at.
"Do you have kids? ""Yes, I have a son."""
That looks more like a snake than a fish.
She took the entrance exam yesterday.
We all suspect him of murder.
What do you all think?
Come home before six.
Tom left Australia the next day.
Tom kissed Mary and then went to work.
"Instead of wasting all day napping, you should help out once in a while."
I feel happy.
You may use my car.
Are you a creature of habit?
Pack your things.
I won't go there again.
I've only just come back.
"Even at 50 years old, she's still breathtakingly beautiful."
How was your trip?
This tastes like chicken.
You look nervous.
I could be a genius.
I don't know what that means.
Aren't you being very rude?
What can I show you?
The fire has been put out.
It seems Tom wants to become a teacher.
Are you going to see Tom tonight?
How about going swimming?
He's on the radio.
I don't speak much French.
She disappeared into thin air.
Promises should be kept.
I'll only wait 3 minutes for you.
Are you ready to start your journey?
I want a good dictionary.
Was the money I gave you enough?
Will there be school tomorrow?
Is that a new perfume?
"I'll find you a job, so don't worry."
Do you really love me?
Send a photo.
Tom wasn't taken hostage.
How about some cocoa?
We'll be back next year.
She is reading a manual on gardening.
I'm going to give you just one more chance.
Are you nuts?
These umeboshi are really salty.
I don't think that Tom is selfish.
"I can speak a little French, but I'm still not very good at it."
Nothing is as hard as a diamond.
I'm sorry to trouble you.
That chef prepares different meals every day.
Tom's cat is a calico.
We went to different schools.
This car is mine.
I wasn't aware that somebody was watching me.
Is there much demand for these goods?
It happened one year ago.
My grandfather likes to walk.
"The more, the better."
Tom lives near a park.
What do you usually do in your free time?
"This place is large, isn't it?"
I don't know who you want to see.
Please come again.
We'll all die sooner or later.
I don't have to be here.
It's not as if just anybody can write a literary gem.
Here I come.
What color is Tom's bicycle?
I'm not sure how I did that.
"Thanks to his recommendation, I was able to get a teaching job at a college in Tokyo."
I don't feel like going out tonight.
I've already read most of the books over there.
I'm sorry I upset you.
I have no one to talk about my problems with.
I bet my bottom dollar he is innocent.
I'm on the phone.
I recommend you to go by train.
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
"He was very tall, so I recognized him at once."
Is there something you want to do this weekend?
He threw a stone at the dog.
"Usually, I stay home all weekend."
It's wrong to blame the parents every time a young person commits suicide.
We're hoping for your quick recovery.
I have to go to sleep.
"Which is older, this book or that one?"
He invited me to the party.
Didn't you read the book?
She put on her hat.
The groom is thirty years old.
You're really a hard worker.
A mixture of snow and rain was falling from the sky.
They shook hands when they met at the airport.
He is not very strict about it.

Don't worry about it. Everything's going to be fine.
I really like this chair.
Can you guess what type of restaurant it was?
My eyes are very sensitive to the light.
She has been busy preparing for her trip to the USA.
I'm not now in a position to help you.
It's not that cheap now.
You should've known better than to put yourself in that situation.
I'm using wireless headphones.
It'll snow today.
Tom lost their trust.
I found my shoes.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
I wonder why I'm so sleepy.
A baby deer can stand as soon as it's born.
My house is just across from the hospital.
The new subway enables me to get to school in 20 minutes.
"My uncle lives in Madrid, the capital of Spain."
My notebook is in the desk.
Tom was smart not to sell his house at that time.
I took a paid day off yesterday.
Add salt and pepper and a pinch of nutmeg.
The park is dangerous at night.
The wind has grown stronger.

Will you show me your album?
My father is a businessman.
Speak French.
The water in this brook is cool and clear.
Is there somebody you want to see?
Let's get you dressed.
I didn't think so.
She's not yet heard the news.
Save dinner for me.
I'd like to finish the job.
It is difficult for me.
I wish I were a bird.
Tom wanted to own a restaurant.
Did you switch the light off in the living room?
I have lost my place.
They wanted to try new ways of living.
You shouldn't lose patience when dealing with kids.
Can you justify your action?
"There's a bird singing in the cage, isn't there?"
"I like grapes, but I can't eat so many."
He talks as if he knew everything.
Watch out for the oncoming traffic.
My jeans shrank in the wash.
I met a friend.
Is it OK if I eat this?
My father often helps me with my homework.
How do you pronounce your name?
I'm a fast eater.
I'll go ask Tom.
I didn't see it.
His opinion was the same as mine.
Mozart was five years old when he wrote his first piece.
I want to become a veterinarian.
Tom just wouldn't listen to me.
My husband reads the newspaper while eating breakfast.
I don't see your name on the list.
The poor girl was dying.
What's inside?
Are you giving up?
I wonder if it'll snow.
Are they all ready?
A curfew was imposed on the city.
How much is the entrance fee?
Can you tell me the time?
Tomorrow is Christmas.
"How long will the meeting last? ""For two hours."""
I like you a lot.
Why don't you rest a bit?
My bicycle has a flat tire.
Who do you think won?
I have a migraine headache.
I took off my boots and put them under the bed.
I haven't said goodbye yet.
I won't be coerced.
I'm studying French.
Do you have any questions regarding today's lesson?
Why don't we have lunch together?
Tom might be able to translate this into French.
Drinking warm milk will help you get to sleep.
Tom had a strange dream last night.
Does Tom still do that?
The police have been searching for the stolen goods for almost a month.
I don't know either of them.
"From space, the earth looks small."
Could you do me a favor? Will you lend me some money?
One of Tom's bad habits is biting his fingernails.
Tom works part-time after school.
Our basement is flooded.
Tom raised three children all by himself.
Why don't you call Tom?
We will contact you as soon as we know.
I haven't heard from Tom recently.
Both Tom and Mary are newspaper reporters.
I always have trouble remembering names.
When did you buy this video?
I'm going to be late for work.
I parked my car next to yours.
From what time to what time is your office open?
Winds from the sea are moist.
I got it for free.
Nothing has been heard from him since he left for America.
I hate when this happens.
Tom never talks to Mary.
There's no place like home.
I like windsurfing.
Don't leave your personal belongings in the washroom.
What exactly did I get wrong?
Do you think that I'm cute?
"Would you like any more? ""No, I've had enough."""
I hope we have good weather tomorrow.
Tom is always borrowing money.
"They say that in America anyone can become president, but perhaps that's not really true."
"I was looking at a dog. However, when I looked again, it had turned into a cat."
Is Tom coming here?
You can't please everybody.
I broke my leg skiing.
"As long as you're here, I'll stay."
I hope you won't expect results immediately.
I'm far from pleased with your behavior.
We defeated them in baseball.
He's always changing his mind.
I have two brothers and three sisters.
You don't have to cancel your vacation.
Do you have any idea what Tom wants to do?
She is my classmate.
I run 10 kilometers every day.
I narrowly escaped being run over by a car.
I'm sick of this hand-to-mouth existence.
It's a great honor to be able to meet you.
He was forced to work overtime.
She is going to be six next year.
He'll be here soon.
He is watching TV now.
You look just like your father looked thirty years ago.
I said shut up.
Tom is being monitored.
He quit smoking for the sake of his health.
Tom said that Mary was beautiful.
Clothes make the man.
Tom smelled the rose.
Some factories pollute the environment.
I didn't want to alarm you.
I bought a T-shirt.
"Good job, everyone!"
I assume this idea will work well.
She is able to grasp the situation.
I got up early in order to catch the first train.
That's mostly correct.
Life without love is just totally pointless.
"I've been back for a week, but I'm still suffering from jet lag."
"Other than Sundays, I work every day."
I thought I saw something.
This place is famous for its scenic beauty.
Tom slowly opened the door.
Take it easy.
The scissors aren't sharp.
Please extend this visa.
We're optimistic.
Tom refused our help.
Thank you.
Bring me the Kleenex.
Are you telling me that Tom doesn't know?
More women than men commit perjury.
"I don't like cats, and my brother doesn't either."
"I'd like some tea, please."
I've received no reply from you yet.
She is from France.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I don't know when he returned from France.
I think the actions he took were right.
Let me help you.
We're going to sell our car.
Did you guys have fun?
It was a fascinating story.
"When you're done, open the window."
I got an F in chemistry.
The man aimed a gun at the detective.
She's a tough one.
I know Tom is afraid of heights.
I usually go to bed at ten.
There is something here.
I slept only two hours. No wonder I'm sleepy.
Is the well deep?
You're too good for me.
Who painted this picture?
My shoulders feel stiff.
I am not sure when he will come.
I love seafood.
My favorite beverage is tea.
I did so for the sake of my health.
Tom was rescued by a passer-by.
Are you famous?
"On average, how many cups of coffee do you drink every day?"
I want to become a ballet dancer.
I don't know that.
You should go to the police and check it out yourself.
He has a loud voice.
She wants to be a tennis player when she grows up.
Tom is a real friend.
Did anybody call on you yesterday?
I took Highway 58.
"Oh, that's a shame."
The mouse squealed.
Do you really need to go?
The meeting starts at 2:30.
Did you use to live here?
I found them lying on the artificial grass.
Tom didn't turn the light off.
Could you shut up for a second?
"That man asked me who I was, but I didn't think it was necessary to answer that question."
"It's raining, so you should stay at home."
"You're a schoolteacher, aren't you?"
Please don't use more water than you need.
He is kind.

Are you afraid of snakes?
This book is too difficult to understand.
I was just about to leave the house when the telephone rang.
She was dressed in red.
These flowers here are prettier than the ones over there.
The children were playing in the park.
I'm crazy about football.
Tom didn't do anything bad.
She didn't reply.
I have a large house.
Tom made me a sandwich.
The only room available is a double.
A lot of reports came to the policeman that a wild monkey was found.
I can't stand to watch you.
Tom has three grown children.
How tall is your youngest brother?
"I'd like to insure this, please."
Italy isn't Greece.
Most boys know his name.
Get away from here.
Are you pregnant?
It is said that his father died in a foreign country.
They're selling fish and meat.
It was a sad story.
I'm glad that I could help.
No one in his class can run faster than he does.
We were three hours late.
Does this seem strange to you?
I could hardly endure the pain.
All you have to do is to push this button.
Please answer in French.
I don't think I can get you to understand how difficult that is.
A good idea came into my mind.
Tom is a priest.
Do you know any good restaurants?
I wouldn't blame you.
He got a nice job recently.
The girl cried out for help.
My joints ache.
Don't leave town.
Can you solve the problem by yourself?
I haven't seen him for a long time.
How do I get to your office from Tokyo Station?
I don't like your going out alone.
Turn the flame down low.
This is totally unacceptable.
Let's eat lunch.
Tom has left town.
I'm waiting for my mother.
Don't pick up the cat.
"Had it not been for your help, I couldn't have done it."
Is Tom still studying at Harvard?
"She's attractive, but she talks too much."
Four people were in the car when the accident happened.
Everyone was calm.
I think it can be deleted.
I'm starting to like you.
Don't sit on that bench.
Tom fled.
Tom showed me how to do it.
The man got mad when his wife called him names.
"If they don't work, they don't get paid."
Could you give me some advice?
I've prepared your bath.
I read the book up to page 80 yesterday.
A good beginning makes a good ending.
Where will you be this time tomorrow?
I need a pair of black shoes.
That car is too expensive for me to buy.
Why don't you try putting a little cinnamon in your coffee?
What do you want to be in the future?
"Do you like sports? ""Yes, I like baseball, among other things."""
There's lots of rain all year.
Tom never hurt Mary.
This is a great opportunity to increase our market share.
Please accept my sincere apologies.
That's a good question.
Steak and caviar are my favorite foods.
Do you think that you can find someone to replace Tom?
I want ice cream.
He uses foul language whenever he gets angry.
These are gifts for my friends.
Read it aloud.
The sky is getting dark.
This is the house where I lived when I was young.
This milk has a strange taste.
I already knew this.
Tom is so cute.
They made him work from morning till night.
"Yuck, there's a hair floating in the soup."
How much money did Tom spend?
Please promise me that you won't forget me.
I meant it as a joke.
She doesn't have any friends.
What're you watching?
Thanks for everything.
"Let's have one more drink, and then I'll take you back home."
That's a fake.
This is also ideal as a gift.
I still think about her from time to time.
Tom's swimming.
My hobby is drawing.
Why have the apes evolved more than other animals?
Don't go outside.
When are you planning on getting married?
"Can I use your dictionary? ""Yes, here you are."""
I don't know what this word means.
I'm going to leave the library at six-thirty.
The house was carried away by the flood.
Tom is too old to live alone.
He shined his shoes.
Tom and Mary swam in the pond together.
Are you here on business or for pleasure?
I must have the wrong number.
He went on walking for two hours.
I'd like to see a volcano.
We have two children.
This is interesting.
She stood looking at a boat on the river.
We're in a safe place now.
When will the next train arrive?
"What he told us the other day simply doesn't make sense, does it?"
I don't feel too well.
Tom is my assistant.
My friend is seventeen years old.
I have a lot of homework to do today.
Guess who won.
"Inhale, and exhale."
Are you interested in astronomy?
You're absolutely correct.
Tom lowered his voice and told Mary that he loved her.
Tom is afraid of nothing.
I've never seen this sort of bird.
Would you like to go out with me?
Our team lost all its games.
The job is not suitable for young girls.
Where's the nearest pharmacy? I need to buy some medicine.
The plane landed at 6 o'clock on the dot.
I thought that you didn't know that.
What do you poison cockroaches with?
Was Tom in Boston last week?
The parking lot is free of charge.
I wasn't able to remember the title of that song.
It's too late to fix that now.
That isn't important to me.
"Tom doesn't talk much, does he?"
Make yourself at home.
You're not allowed to smoke here.
Tom doesn't like to talk about his work.
Can I take a picture here?
I don't recall.
I feel like going home.
The company suffered a heavy loss.
Is there any place around here that rents bicycles?
Tom was very busy yesterday afternoon.
Tell me when you're ready.
It's all my fault.
There is little hope of success.
I don't have any money.
He fell into the river.
I thought that we were going out to dinner.
It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
The beggar turned out to be a thief.
I don't hate it.
Tom only ran a little bit.
This organization relies entirely on voluntary donations.
My name is Tom.
Tom likes folk music.
I'm sure my parents won't let me go by myself.
1980 was the year that I was born.
She sat next to me.
Hokkaido is in the northern part of Japan.
Are you left-handed?
"I'm fine, too, thank you."
I couldn't stand looking at it.
Tom and John both fell in love with Mary.
Tom has already gone.
I'm always tense before I get on an airplane.
They're fighting.
Can I fix you a hot drink?
I don't think it's strange at all.
How old are you?
This bird cannot fly.
Please open the window.
Are you for or against the plan?
She hates carrots.
"Read it again, please."
Are you hesitant to go there?
I want the young members to be more active.
Read this.
I couldn't stand it anymore.
The old man spoke to me in French.
Should I cut my hair?
My doctor told me that I should eat more.
Tsunamis swept through rice fields and flooded the towns.
Do you want to go out with me tonight?
It's better not to go there alone.
I wonder where Tom got this.
He's had many unhappy experiences.
She's afraid of getting sick again.
It'll clear up soon.
This snake isn't poisonous.
I apologize for not writing to you before.
"I own 1,000 shares of NTT stock."
You lead the way and I'll follow you.
It was a hard day.
There are a lot of things I have to do before tomorrow.
I think you're right.
Tom doesn't need a babysitter.
Have you finished packing yet?
I overslept so I was late to school.
I need someone who can speak French.
The taxi is waiting outside.
Whose handbag is this?
Somebody has been sleeping on this sofa.
Let me handle that.
That boy doesn't have a mother.
It was warm today.
Can I take pictures here?
She'd never been so frightened.
Is French taught in schools in Australia?
"I want to buy a new laptop, but I don't have the money."
He's a big boy.
Have as much fun as you can.
Choose whichever you want.
Tom is too good for you.
My pocket was picked.
I caught a cold.
You've really helped me a lot.
I telephoned her at once.
I can take care of myself.
I saw Tom yesterday in a restaurant. He was talking to a girl.
Mt. Everest is the highest mountain in the world.
"I only ordered coffee, since I wasn't hungry."
"Tom is trying to scare us, isn't he?"
I regret not being able to join you.
He is washing his car.
This book is easy for me to read.
This translation is better than that one.
Is Tom good?
His story sounds true.
Tom must have been asleep.
Tom got bitten by a horse.
"I'm in danger, too."
Is Tom a good-looking guy?
He hugged her.
I'm disappointed in you.
I'm sure that is the truth.
Supper's almost ready.
"You're still angry, aren't you?"
Tom and Mary weren't surprised at all.
I don't know which bus to take.
Is the dining room open now?
Why was I so stupid?
It may give rise to serious trouble.
Is that a real diamond?
"If it doesn't rain, let's go out."
"I don't like cats, nor does my brother."
Have you bought a watermelon?
"At last, it stopped raining."
This task is too much for me.
It looks like rain. We should close the windows.
"If you ask me, she's a little unusual."
Could you help me find my keys?
She asked me to pass her the salt.
You can't fix it. You should buy a new one.
Please excuse my bad handwriting.
"In April of 1968, Rev. King was in Memphis, Tennessee."
I want to save more money.
A loud knocking at the door woke him up.
What's bothering Tom?
I stayed home this summer.
Don't throw garbage away here.
Tom told me that he was really busy.
He passed the entrance examination.
"Keep silent, or I'll throw you out of here."
Let's start the ball rolling by introducing ourselves.
I have mixed feelings about this.
I'll love you till I die.
"Add 5 and 2, and you get 7."
I was right behind them.
Are you absolutely sure this is Tom's house?
I haven't downloaded the files yet.
Could I have money for my piano lesson?
"I was busy, so I didn't eat lunch."
Tom is still in the car.
You said you didn't drink.
I just now found this.
Why did that happen?
He is afraid to swim.
I don’t want to get any older.
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
Books are like friends.
I like football.
Shut the door.
I've nothing to do today.
What you said doesn't make sense.
I'm going to watch TV this evening.
Tom bought a webcam.
The boy grabbed the cat by the tail.
Don't hold back anything.
"Tom, what do you want to be in the future?"
There's a big hole in your sock.
Tom loves doing this.
Safety is an illusion.
We're waiting for our turn.
Will you tell me when three minutes is up?
I grew up in this small town.
Tom burst into laughter.
Please tell me your name.
I can see why you wouldn't want to eat there.
She is not my sister but my mother.
What do you have in your bag?
Will you take care of the children while I'm out?
This clock is out of order.
She was in the United States last month.
Can you make the deadline?
He is afraid of becoming sick.
Have you ever been to Africa?
I speak very fast.
Here comes the train.
I didn't understand the second-to-the-last line.
I am convinced that I am right.
I don't feel like doing my math homework now.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
They caught the lion alive.
It's a beautiful day.
Everybody agrees with you.
Maybe he has lots of girlfriends.
Tom went out for a walk as he always does in the afternoon.
Is everybody all right?
The police informed us of the accident.
"I'm going to ask you straight out. Who do you like better, Tom or me?"
I'm a senior.
We put our sunglasses on.
I've never heard her speak ill of others.
Are you going to quit your job?
I love blueberry tarts.
I can't get rid of my pimples.
The cat was curled up asleep.
My watch needs to be repaired.
I was born the year my grandfather died.
I just wanted to see her.
Tom isn't in his room. I wonder where he is.
Tom is skipping rope.
I haven't seen him lately.
I haven't seen you in a long time.
This room has two closets for clothing.
Tom sighed deeply.
You should know better now you're an adult.
I'm not a baby.
Just stop it.
Tom didn't laugh.
I want to drink something.
I helped my mother in the kitchen.
I'll make sure of it.
Tom lent Mary some money.
"Seen at a distance, the rock looks like a squatting human figure."
Are you familiar with sign language?
What are you cooking?
Was all of that true?
What did you give Tom for Christmas?
There's little hope that Tom will recover.
She hates fish and never eats any.
They jumped into the water.
Maybe I'll come tomorrow.
"As far as I'm concerned, things are going well."
He gets a haircut three times a month.
It appeared that she was trying to keep back tears.
How are you doing?
Let's pray for rain.
She can't bring herself to throw away photo albums filled with memories of him.
There were many mosquitoes in the room.
It's awfully hot today.
Why did she do that?
Don't count on him to lend you any money.
You have to give up sports for a while.
Tom also has one.
Is seaweed good for you?
"You couldn't solve the problem, could you?"
The man you see over there is my uncle.
It's time to take my pills.
How are the kids?
Please give me some more bread.
My father is absent on business.
The new designs are much better than the old ones.
Tom is a college graduate.
Take a close look at this picture.
What did she buy at the shop?
All of the milk was spilled.
Almost every student failed the exam.
Tom's stomach growled.
Why's it so expensive?
Nobody can ever help me.
See you tomorrow morning.
What he said made us angry.
"When I was a child, I believed in Santa Claus."
Come a bit closer.
I'd like to see you again.
I'll take a shower.
"If Cleopatra's nose had been shorter, the whole face of the world would have been changed."
Study French.
The word yes never escapes his lips.
"You know that I'm still planning on joining the team, don't you?"
You have a bright future.
His debts amounted to a thousand dollars.
I wonder whether Tom is here.
She is a real beauty.
The least you could do is to answer me.
This isn't funny.
My idea is different from yours.
Why was Tom killed?
Were the windows closed?
Tell me what you have in mind.
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
How did you meet your wife?
I'll never forget what Tom said.
I can ride a horse.
Let's go to my house.
I'm keeping a secret.
Playing golf is a lot of fun.
This beer contains 5% alcohol.
Do you think Tom is hungry?
This is certainly surprising.
Will you give me another glass of milk?
This desk takes up too much room.
I have no idea to what extent I can trust them.
I translated the letter into French for Tom.
Please give me another pillow.
Don't forget to include me in the count.
I made him open the door.
I only asked you the question out of curiosity.
There are no exceptions to this rule.
Would you say it once more?
The shelves are empty.
I like movies.
I have three more pages to go.
How's the weather in Boston?
Tom complains all the time.
I've seen an angel once.
I turned the TV off.
I put an advertisement in the newspaper saying my house was for sale.
A clenched fist may indicate stress.
I want to do some shopping around here.
"The hallway is slippery, so watch your step."
Are you giving this to Tom?
I completely agree with Tom.
Leave it as it is.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
You must be tired.
Cookie is a golden retriever.
Can I have another piece of cake?
I twisted my ankle.
Getting up at six o'clock is okay for me.
It's about the size of an egg.
Tom isn't mad at you.
When was she born?
Is Tom in a coma?
She answered my letter soon.
He ran away from home.
What're you doing here?
My uncle is angry.
Tom is a dangerous man.
It's very bright.
It looks like the wind's getting stronger.
Luck is against me.
You ought to see a doctor.
Tom put flowers on Mary's grave.
"Promise? ""Yes, I promise."""
The deer fell prey to the lion.
Tom must've gone fishing alone.
She is over twenty.
I want the same dictionary as you have.
What's important isn't which university you've graduated from but what you've learned in the university.
The table is wobbly.
Apparently Tom's father is into photography.
My birthday's next week.
"If the weather is good, I'll leave tomorrow."
She is a little shy.
It is difficult to solve this problem.
Don't drink any alcohol.
I hear footsteps.
Do you have your own room?
Do you know who he is?
I'm a realistic person.
I'm good at skiing.
I hope so.
Some boats are on the lake.
Take care!
Nobody noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
I'm just another man.
"Tom, it's me. Can we talk?"
What happened to you? Are you hurt?
Why don't we play it by ear?
I never want to see you again.
Thank you all the same.
Is it my turn to pay?
"I can't read French, let alone speak it."
There's a hair in my soup.
It's dinner time.
It was so dark that they could hardly see.
I need a bigger room.
The school is only five minutes' walk from here.
Is he still angry?
"Which is larger, Japan or Britain?"
I'm a Windows person.
Take out your notebooks.
I may go to Boston tomorrow.
"Honey, will you go shopping for me?"
I think we should talk outside.
Tom showed me his room.
She refused his proposal.
Tom pulled a delicious-looking pizza out of the oven.
I've known Tom for a few years.
Tom and I go to the same high school.
I have a son who's sick.
Where is Tom going?
Please don't hesitate to call.
This is difficult.
It's too hot.
"All of a sudden, the thirty-story skyscraper went up in flames."
I fixed my computer.
I’d like to improve my guitar skills.
Tom is in high spirits today.
I'm thinking of going to the States during the summer vacation.
It's perfectly useless.
I wish my neighbors would get rid of their wind chimes.
The party stayed in Kyoto for a short period.
I'll be there right away.
That's too bad.
He swam until he could swim no more.
I feel lousy.
What are you drinking?
How is your new class?
See if you can open the door.
I go to visit my friend in the hospital every other day.
This isn't French.
Do it right.
He made a sharp turn to the left.
I ran so I would be on time.
"At last, it began to rain."
You should learn how to use your dictionary.
It was all my fault.
Would you carry this down to the second floor for me?
These are edible mushrooms.
I don't understand this word.
Everything looks the same.
Tom should be here tomorrow at 2:30.
The moon is coming up over the mountains.
This book is worth reading again and again.
He is fond of adventure.
You must do it by the end of this week.
What're you staring at?
Don't blink.
Her mother passed away last year.
He will come back in a few days.
Could you give me a ride to the station?
I go to the barber's once a month.
Are you going to see Tom?
I am going to a concert next week.
Are you just going to give up?
It's not necessarily so.
"If you would like to speak to a customer service representative, please press three."
Was yesterday a hot day?
It was black.
Do you still have it?
A strange sound was heard from behind the door.
I had a fight with my older brother yesterday.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Taking care of the baby is my job.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
I am tired from walking.
Good evening. How many are in your party?
I want to live somewhere warmer.
I wondered why people were staring at me.
She died in 1960.
Someone leaked the secret to the enemy.
This is Tom's dirty little secret.
Playing the piano is her favorite pastime.
You can't trust Tom.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
I wonder where this path goes.
The cherry blossoms are at their best now.
It's the end of the year.
The children are beginning to get out of hand.
"Luckily, I won first prize."
Tom crashed Mary's party.
"Which do you like better, summer or winter?"
When was the last time you got your hair cut?
I don't like women who drink a lot.
"The telephone rang, but nobody answered."
You can't swim here.
I've heard this story scores of times.
Birds sing.
Do you often become dizzy if you get up from bed quickly?
A number of students are absent today.
Tom missed the opportunity.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
He will come back soon.
She had the hotel suite to herself.
That piano is expensive.
Have you heard anything about the organization?
My mother made some new clothes.
"Because of rain, we couldn't go to the beach."
Was anybody killed?
I'm happy to see you.
You can do whatever you like.
You dropped your key.
I don't go to school by bus.
Were you with Tom that night?
Our school has a gym but not a swimming pool.
I'm waiting for an important call.
I regret becoming a teacher.
The black telephone is more expensive than the white one.
My family needs me and I need my family.
"You're planning to go again tomorrow, aren't you?"
Staying home isn't fun.
I'm waiting for someone.
I'm looking for my keys.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Bad news travels quickly.
I never thought that this would happen.
I'm not very good at swimming.
I have more toys than you do.
Where were you that night?
Quick judgements are dangerous.
Tom's new girlfriend is quite attractive.
My grades are above average.
Old people deserve respect.
It is true that he is over seventy.
Please accept our condolences.
How about next Saturday?
Tom's cat is cute.
Tom didn't take his mask off.
I hope there's still some bread left.
Will you help me pack my suitcase?
Do you suppose that this is true?
Tom made a number of mistakes on his test.
"I had money, credit cards, and my driver's license in my wallet."
Tastes differ.
Why is Tom here? He should be in school.
Tom didn't have enough money to buy what he needed.
It was dark when I reached the hotel.
I'd like a cup of coffee.
Would you like some more tea?
We don't have time to eat now.
Are you going to call Tom?
There are life jackets under your seats.
A big spider was spinning a web.
Is Tom a good guy?
I just found out that Tom is Mary's ex-boyfriend.
"This seems like something out of a movie, doesn't it?"
"Tom is coming to the party, too."
I believe whatever he says.
I feel sick whenever I see blood.
You need to go to bed.
I take off my shoes when I go in my house.
I asked him to send us the book.
"Everybody was disguised, so I couldn't tell who was who."
Dogs are smart.
Let's make it 3:00.
Pack your belongings.
This is the wallet I found.
He is also returning late today.
Fill the bottle with water.
Do you play a musical instrument?
I majored in chemistry at the university.
Tom bought a table.
I don't know how to play golf at all.
Someone stole Tom's guitar.
Is Tom still on the phone?
I think Tom is going to faint.
Girls are strange sometimes.
I always drink lots of water.
He is above suspicion.
Stop sniffling and blow your nose.
Give it to whoever needs it.
Let's get down to business.
I'd do it again if I had the chance.
To distinguish right from wrong is difficult.
Where is the wedding to be?
The man was given a life sentence.
Beef is usually more expensive than pork.
May I borrow this book?
I don't want to be a hero.
You had better not climb such high mountains in winter.
Take care!
I don't think he is sincere.
I'm sorry that I misunderstood you.
She was scared by the big earthquake.
Tom had an upset stomach.
Are you the one who ate my sandwich?
Are you sure there's nothing else to drink?
I need to find a place to live.
I was caught in an evening shower.
I live an hour away from work.
Let's spread the map on the table and talk it over.
Can I stay here?
I caught a bad cold.
"Open the windows, please."
He won't come in a rain like this.
It is a nice view from here.
The boy grew up to be a great statesman.
"What time is it? ""It is ten-thirty."""
I didn't need to paint the fence.
You shouldn't have given up so soon.
A solution needs to be found quickly.
Mary is wearing a colorful kimono.
I'm just lazy.
What is this?
My father is engaged in foreign trade.
Tom looked down at his broken leg.
What kind of music do you like to listen to?
I'm sorry for you.
She is quiet.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
What do you think you'll get on tomorrow's test?
Tell me about it.
Where did you get that hat?
I take a bath every day.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
Drive slowly.
Can't you do something to help me?
He was admitted to that school without taking the exam.
Do you like these colors?
Tom tried to stop it.
Does Tom ever get carsick?
Tom jumped into the water with a splash.
"If I were rich, I would do so. As it is, I can do nothing."
Look at the picture.
It's not so hot anymore.
"When their leader died, they placed his body in a large tomb."
Forget about that.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
Is it OK if I turn the lights on?
"If you're cold, you can turn on the heater."
"It's been a long time since I've heard the word ""baby bottle""."
I hope that it's fine tomorrow.
Everybody knows his name.
My parents enjoy skiing every winter.
"His name is Tom, not John."
The news of the fire in the factory caused a sensation.
My daughter was premature.
It is better to take your time than to hurry and make mistakes.
I have no patience.
"We had hoped some students would come, but there was no one in the classroom."
Could you push the door open?
I'm sorry that I called you a liar.
"That isn't fair, is it?"
There's even a chance that Tom will be there.
I study English half an hour every day.
Has Tom returned?
She was promoted.
Tom gets up early.
There's a lot to do today.
I'll lend you my car.
He doesn't know English.
I want to live forever.
He took off his hat.
Tom is going to apply for a job with a computer company.
He likes to watch baseball games on TV.
Tom said he wanted to be alone and went up to his room.
Tom was a pretty good basketball player in high school.
Could you please pull the weeds and water the flowers?
I can't do this job alone.
This mushroom is poisonous.
I assume it was Tom's idea.
It's my turn to drive next.
We ate.
How should I know?
I took a taxi to the station.
Tom wants to buy a present for Mary.
"This pen belongs to you, doesn't it?"
Shut your big mouth.
You disappointed me.
Is French more difficult than English?
Send me some pictures.
Tom is milking the cow.
He goes to school by bus.
Thanks.
The cat prefers fish to meat.
"Tom is in the hospital, recovering from a drug overdose."
Someone will do that job.
The policeman arrested the thief.
"As usual, Tom got up early in the morning and swam."
I have seen little of him lately.
He ended up expelled.
Switch off the light.
I was captivated by her beauty.
I'm going to lay aside that money for emergencies.
Did Tom hurt Mary?
I'm going to stay home today.
English is spoken by more people than any other language.
I can't remember her address.
"As soon as we got there, it began to rain."
Tom continued to honk the horn.
The next train to the airport departs from platform 2.
I take it for granted that they'll get married.
This isn't any good.
"Where do you live? ""I live in Tokyo."""
This work is by no means easy.
I want to drink something cold.
What's in your pockets?
I have lost my pencil.
Tell her you like her. Don't be afraid. She won't bite you.
"If you whip the steering wheel around like that on a snowy road, the car is going to go into a slide."
Tom made a phone call.
You may have it for nothing.
I didn't tell them.
The clock gains five minutes a day.
Ouch! My finger got caught in the door.
Let's go to the new Chinese restaurant on Park Street.
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I'd like to have cheesecake for dessert.
The exact temperature is 22.68 degrees Celsius.
I'm listening to music.
She accommodated her schedule to his.
I had a lot of fun.
These roses are beautiful.
Are you going to go?
I don't have any cash on me.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
It's my treat.
It's about time you went to the barber's.
Do you have dogs?
Let me see your hands.
Was Tom listening?
The driver accelerated his car.
Behave yourself.
"Don't get mad, OK?"
This is a proverb that I don't understand.
Keep mum about this plan.
She boasts that she's good at cooking.
I said drop it!
What's your favorite spice?
My father and mother were sitting under a tree.
Are you afraid?
What are you lining up for?
I can't explain it either.
Don't give up!
It was very windy.
He quit smoking.
"Some of them are healthy, but some of them aren't."
We're out of stock now.
It worked.
I'd like to change my image.
I have the impression that he knows the secret.
I have to cancel.
What flower do you like best?
How wonderful!
Did I make a mistake again?
Are you new?
Is it OK to sit here?
I think Tom needs to go there.
I can't see anything.
Can I use your telephone?
"If you were forced to sign that contract, then it's invalid."
You and I are both men.
Tom married the prettiest woman in town.
He is sure of success.
I like that house.
What do you plan on doing?
She doesn't believe in God.
Everybody knows I'm Tom's girlfriend.
How old is your older brother?
My father is busy getting ready for his trip.
The truck bumped into a car.
Don't use elevators during earthquakes.
She goes to a school for the deaf.
"Give me the bill, please."
I am not as interested in literature as you.
Can I see that?
He got over the shock of his father's death.
That is not how we do things here.
I was scolded by my teacher.
Where are your horses?
It probably won't be easy to do that.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
I saved Tom a seat.
How is it going?
I painted the gate blue.
I didn't know what it meant.
This is one of the best restaurants in town.
You're always watching TV.
"Finally, we reached the top of the mountain."
I want a refund.
My hobby is taking pictures.
Do you know her?
Tom won't be back anytime soon.
What is that?
Our family usually has turkey for Thanksgiving.
Go to work.
There are too many things that need to be done.
Workers at the company went on a strike.
Did you feed the dog this morning?
There are more girls than boys in this class.
Words failed me.
"Well, I think that Tom's right."
Will you lend me your bicycle?
That's right!
My brother seems to enjoy himself at college.
Tom couldn't speak French well.
I'll take you up on that.
I wonder if Tom ever gives Mary flowers.
The flight was canceled because of heavy fog.
He went on talking as though nothing had happened.
Is it new?
What did you say?
Was that all Tom said?
You should begin right away.
Are you sure that Tom plays the violin?
I have a lot of things to do this afternoon.
I confused her with her sister.
I never meant to say that the conservatives are generally stupid. I meant to say that stupid people are generally conservative.
I didn't want to stand in line.
I belong to the karate club.
Tom is dying.
Beauty is only skin deep.
I'm too busy to go.
Tom is my half-brother.
What's your favorite food?
It sounds like you guys have a healthy relationship.
I'll know someday.
Tom talked about his trip.
What beautiful weather!
I would rather stay home than go out with him.
I arrived here before you did.
The hot water isn't running.
She is a total stranger to me.
This is true.
I went to swim in the river yesterday.
"Last year, I decided to come to Japan."
I've had a slight headache since last night.
I'll make some coffee.
Tom was dressed for warmth rather than fashion.
The boys are playing rugby.
What are you going to do with that?
Sometimes everything goes wrong.
"If there's a typhoon tomorrow, does that mean I don't have to go to work?"
"People can easily start loving, but not so easily stop."
We discussed our future plans.
I excused myself for a minute.
Both Tom and Mary are really tall.
"The small fork is for your salad, and the large one is for the main course."
Let me think a minute.
It's pouring outside.
The question is who made that mistake.
I didn't leave the door open.
He leaves for China tomorrow.
"The price is low, but the quality isn't very good."
I would like the least expensive one.
Please give me some kind of medicine to curb the pain.
I hurt my back.
Tom was arrested for drunken driving.
Do as he tells you.
"The girl was carrying several books, not textbooks but thick hardback books."
Cherry blossoms are in full bloom.
I'm at my wit's end.
Tom noticed.
Have you had a nice day?
Are you mad at me?
I've been stung by a hornet.
I will return at 6:30.
I got a traffic ticket.
"Thank you for everything. ""You're welcome."""
I'd like you to come with us.
"Now, what do you think?"
I didn't tell anyone what you did.
My back and shoulders are sore.
I'm hungry.
I want to open a restaurant of my own.
The train has just arrived here.
Tom went to a nearby restaurant to have lunch.
I like the color of your shirt.
Do you have any ID?
"Would you pass me the cream cheese, please?"
You seem to have mistaken me for my older brother.
Let's wait here till he comes back.
I wonder why she didn't tell him about it.
We were impatient for the concert to begin.
We did our best to help them.
I'm looking forward to receiving your favorable answer.
Do your best!
He is able to speak five languages.
"When I got up this morning, I had a headache."
It's nice you found a girlfriend.
Tom decided to stay in Australia.
I regret that quite a lot.
I feel something.
I need a new bike.
I want to eat ramen.
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
On your mark! Get set! Go!
I've been very busy lately.
I thought it was a good idea.
I hate it when there are a lot of people.
I don't want to translate that.
I'm pleased to meet you.
This idea is not rational.
I'm listening to Bach now.
Her face is covered with pimples.
Tom's new wife is younger than his daughter from his first marriage.
We ate together.
"Hurry up, otherwise you'll be late for lunch."
He'll run out of luck sooner or later.
Is Tom still doing the same job?
I gave you everything you wanted.
I'll find the money somehow.
Tom wasn't seriously injured.
"On cloudy days, you can hear distant sounds better than in clear weather."
"This watch cost 70,000 yen."
He is doing penance.
Don't you believe it?
I'll admit I'm wrong.
Tom persuaded her into going to the movies with him.
He made her a bookshelf.
"Could I have a subway map, please?"
Would you mail this letter for me on your way to school?
Is this OK?
I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
"Strictly speaking, you're wrong."
Australia is rich in natural resources.
I hugged her tightly.
I wish she were alive now.
These clothes are not appropriate for a cold winter day.
I got a tooth pulled.
It's still a bit early.
Some people think it's a bad idea.
Two families live in that house.
"You taught French for a few years in Boston, didn't you?"
Why did Tom need it?
I often hear her play the piano.
My head hurts.
Help Mary take off her coat.
I'm still dating Tom.
Do you remember what I told you?
I used to go skiing in the winter.
Tom complains all the time.
Thank you so much.
"We tried to get Tom to change his mind, but we couldn't."
I want to go to Boston.
The vase that Tom broke is Mary's.
Tom shot Mary.
I'm leaving.
Tom is too old to be doing this kind of thing.
"Turn off the radio, please."
May I ask another question?
"If you cook, I'll wash the dishes."
Tom knows Mary very well.
How much does this sofa cost?
"When I heard the news on the radio, a chill ran down my spine."
It's rather cold.
Math is what I'm best at.
This is confidential.
When are you going to buy a new car?
Don't play around too much after school.
When will she return home?
Please pass it to the other boys.
What are you referring to?
Please speak English.
Tom took a cold shower.
I'll tell Daddy on you.
Please turn on the television.
You have the choice of soup or salad.
Tom knows very little about racing.
There's some milk in the fridge.
Don't forget to write to me.
You are quite right.
It's not easy to lose weight.
I want to go to another country.
I hate politics.
We admired the beautiful sunset.
Is there a barber shop in the hotel?
Boil some water.
I shave almost every day.
The size of the carpet is 120 by 160 centimeters.
We've already taken your name off the list.
You should consult the dictionary.
Last year was a good one.
"I missed my family, so I went back."
Where's the museum?
He retires next spring.
What does everyone do after school?
I felt a sharp pain in my stomach all of a sudden.
I'm going to meet him tomorrow.
How about a cup of tea?
I'm going to have a siesta.
We gave him up for dead.
She scolded him because he left the door open.
When was this church built?
I'm an early riser.
The ball rolled across the road.
She took the book back to the library.
Do you want to watch the baseball game on TV?
Please keep an eye on my kids.
Diet drinks taste terrible.
Tom scrubbed his feet.
There is a pair of scissors on the desk.
I like horses.
I really don't want to go.
"If we aren't careful, someone will get hurt."
Is this the right way to the museum?
The teacher compared my poem with one of his.
What does it mean?
We went early to make certain we could get seats.
The math homework proved to be easier than I had expected.
I worked on a farm.
There's a lot of furniture in this room.
I hate chemistry.
You don't have to go.
There were no flowers or trees on the street.
Tom isn't a lazy man.
Can someone answer the telephone?
I had a hard time.
Don't talk to me before I've had my coffee.
"President Polk was old, tired and in poor health."
I think that Tom is in trouble.
Tom is good at playing the violin.
I made up my mind.
"Yeah. I think so, too."
There's no chance of rain today.
Tom likes maple syrup on his pancakes.
I want you to stay here.
Let's stay in the car until the rain stops.
I've corrected it.
You must make the most of your time.
"Suppose you had a thousand dollars, what would you do with it?"
May I ask a question?
This is just between you and me.
Did Tom die in that accident?
Excuse me. I'd like to point out three errors in the above article.
He turned pale with fright.
I missed you and Tom.
I have some bad news.
What did Tom find?
Please raise your hand before you speak.
The picture was hung upside down.
Is there a bank where I can exchange yen for dollars?
He started to study in earnest.
My younger sister's husband is older than I am.
She went out of the room with downcast eyes.
This job is perfect for you.
He is an extremely frank person.
Tom volunteered.
He bowed to me as he left the room.
I don't have any change.
I need an envelope.
Stay with me here.
Can you ride without a saddle?
Leave it to me.
Let's unfold the map on the table and discuss it.
The doctor gave me a prescription.
I'm really stupid.
Did you buy a nice bicycle?
I promised Tom that I'd play tennis with him.
It's a five-minute walk to school.
He is a dentist by profession.
The hotel is within easy access of the station.
Tom has one brother.
He stared at me from head to foot.
Drive safely.
I wanted to buy a dog.
Is Tom in the office?
How far is it from here to Tokyo?
This arrangement is only temporary.
Tom is going to have surgery.
Tom has disappeared.
Did you phone him?
Kendo is a Japanese martial art.
"No matter what your profession, or how happy you may be in it, there are moments when you wish you had chosen some other career."
I'm sorry for what I have done.
He's now aboard the ship.
I think about her often.
I can't go with you. I have a meeting.
She glanced through the magazine.
Her father never let her go to town with her friends.
The sun emerged from behind the clouds.
We had our photo taken on the beach.
Tom read a book to Mary.
Strawberries are now in season.
Haven't I met you before?
She has been dead five years.
That's a waste of money.
Someone is calling you.
I don't want to live with Tom.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Do you watch TV?
Why isn't anybody visiting my website?
How many tickets do you need?
I'll take a shortcut across the garden.
How is your dad?
The guests should be arriving soon.
I got caught in the rain and got all wet.
She kept on crying.
Were you reading a book at that time?
We have to do something for the dead.
Tom and Mary live in an old castle.
The wheel began to turn.
When did you quit smoking?
Begin with books that are easy to understand.
I'm getting along with my mother-in-law very well.
Tell me what you want.
They carried the boats almost thirty kilometers.
Is Tom there yet?
I have pus coming out of my gums.
Could you give me a discount?
She misses him.
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
I got a sunburn.
What was I wearing at that time? Do you remember?
Not having a telephone is an inconvenience.
May I have an advance on my salary?
"You like rain, don't you?"
That kind of machine is yet to be invented.
Tom is a proficient marksman.
The room will be painted tomorrow.
What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Don't feed the animals.
I saw something white in the park.
He had his socks on inside out.
I'm worried about my mother's health.
Tom looked like he wasn't feeling very well.
Don't close the door.
Tom didn't know Mary liked to cook.
"Tom, I think you should watch this movie."
How much is the express?
Your account is empty.
I want to learn a lot more languages.
Why do you like Boston so much?
Why me?
Were you shot at?
Where do the airport buses leave from?
You may go home.
Mary was such a lovely bride.
I'm good at soccer.
I look forward to seeing you again.
Was Tom at home?
I have a lot of model cars.
It is impossible for you to do so.
He can speak Japanese.
Come as soon as you can.
She was pleased to see the results.
Were Tom and Mary in the library yesterday?
This is my mobile phone.
I was disappointed that you didn't call.
I have no idea what it is.
Whose car is this?
Thanks to both of you.
I wonder if Tom is doing well.
Please come and see me any time.
Your condition isn't serious.
My brother goes to the same school I do.
Are you growing a beard?
Your mobile phone just rang.
It is no use trying to persuade him.
"Are you nervous? ""Yeah, a little."""
It's not cold.
"Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach."
I'm not thirty years old.
Are you going to go home earlier than usual today?
"We lost our way, and what was worse, we were caught in a shower."
He gave up the plan for economic reasons.
Tom knows the truth.
He was too shy to do that.
Tom looks exhausted.
She did not turn up.
Don't leave the air conditioner on.
Did you have a good sleep?
Tom was plastered.
I look forward to seeing you again in Japan.
She fooled him.
There's so much dust here.
I was annoyed with him for interrupting me.
"Well, at least let me set the table."
Tom knows the answer.
Do you go to an elementary school?
We must tear down this house.
I can't do it either.
I can still remember the time when we went on a picnic together.
"Good morning, everyone."
Tom ate all the cupcakes.
Can you hold my shopping bags for me?
"There's something I want to buy, the boy said."
Please let me pay.
We took part in the contest.
How do you feel now?
I'm going out with Tom tonight.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't get fired.
Tom thinks it's impossible for Mary to break the record.
Say no more.
Developing political awareness takes time.
Once in a while everything goes wrong.
Mary is the cutest girl in our class.
I'm on your side.
The other day I discovered a book written by my father.
Let's drink some coffee.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I was there yesterday.
Tom is still a bachelor.
I changed trains at Tokyo Station.
Tom left Boston in 2013.
Why not have dinner with us?
Don't forget our date tomorrow.
She liked it.
I have a friend in England.
I have to go soon because I left the engine running.
This isn't a real diamond.
It's going to rain pretty soon.
This month is already half over.
Guns don't kill people. People kill people.
Tom is sleeping like a log.
Don't throw anything away.
He keeps two cats.
I'm tired of hearing you complaining.
Where did you buy that dress?
"She was a child, but she wasn't afraid."
My house was robbed while I was away.
I don't like your taste in color.
The criminal is still at large.
I will go cycling even if it rains.
May I turn on the light?
She came to Tokyo when she was 18.
"Sorry, but that's not what I ordered."
We haven't seen you in the past four years.
It's been snowing all day.
I wanted to be able to read minds.
I recognized Mary the moment I saw her.
I'll sit and wait here for Tom.
Wash your face and hands.
Do you want to drink anything?
Aren't you embarrassed?
You sure talk a lot.
Please leave.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
He tried opening the door.
Who is the woman dressed in pink?
Your mind is obviously elsewhere.
Christmas is soon.
How many cows do you have?
Have you ever been to Australia before?
"I'm near-sighted, so I can't make out what is written on that signboard."
I've already done my homework.
Someone must have taken my umbrella by mistake.
"If I were you, I'd go home and take a nap."
I don't remember my grandmother's face exactly.
I think I'll stay put in this town for a while.
I got a book from my father.
Nothing remained in the refrigerator.
That was the last one.
Do you have jeans in my size?
Tom was in bed with a cold.
I would like to borrow fifty dollars from you.
He sat in front of me.
Tom can't tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine.
"Help me, please."
The mayor is said to be on the take.
Hang your coats in the closet.
"Wow, this is a nice table."
He was laughing.
I want to see it for myself.
I have a favor to ask of you.
Tom took his kids to school.
I should've changed it earlier.
Let's go sing karaoke.
I want to buy a camera.
I couldn't go anywhere else.
Is Tom joking?
Tom is on the phone with Mary.
It's only a ten-minute walk.
You must be kidding!
Could you turn the radio down?
I bet we'll have a test today.
The station is ten minutes from here by car.
I'd like to try horseback riding.
"When I look back upon those days, it all seems like a dream."
I'll give you my number.
He does nothing but complain all day long.
What do you think?
There is no school today.
I thought we were going to win.
Have you finished the book I lent you the other day?
I just couldn't put up with the man smelling of whisky sitting next to me.
You have no one but yourself to blame.
Do you feel better?
You do not necessarily have to go there yourself.
I'm all out of money.
Perhaps the train has been delayed.
We're not mad at you.
I generally walk to school.
Education starts at home.
I used to play tennis a lot when I was in high school.
"Now, let's start the class."
I can't attend the meeting.
"You'll have this composition written by noon tomorrow, won't you?"
That's my fiancée.
He took part in the race.
They painted the fence green.
He looks like his father.
Do you know how long they've been married?
He doesn't work here anymore.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
I think I'll stay home.
I don't remember.
Natural food will do you good.
Take good care of yourself.
Tom did twenty pushups.
I can't eat or drink very hot things.
It rained continuously for three days.
Please don't buy that.
This is a problem for young people to solve.
Which CD do you want to listen to?
Oh no! I forgot my wallet.
She is trying to lose weight.
That was a good speech.
I have twins.
Is that what Tom wants?
Don't catch a cold.
I wasn't scared one bit.
I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.
Tom doesn't know for certain what Mary is going to do.
Umbrellas sell well.
Stay here and wait for him.
Tom looked cute.
Will you please hold this edge?
I love my daughter.
"Why are you late, Tom? ""I was eating lunch."""
A young man is singing in front of the door.
What's a lightning rod?
I don't know what to say.
We take our shoes off when entering a house.
You don't look so well.
Help yourself to whatever you like.
That's especially true right now.
I've bought a gift for Tom.
I want to eat meatloaf.
Leave it up to Tom.
I found your blanket.
Why don't we go and see the cherry blossoms?
A good medicine tastes bitter.
The names of the students who failed in the examination were posted on the bulletin board.
You can stay if you want to.
There was a lot of snow last year.
You had better not speak loudly in this room.
Please write your name with a pencil.
"While he was sick, he became very thin."
There's no one in the pool.
Tom is probably sleeping.
Where is the railroad station?
He is the dumbest kid in the class.
Don't use computer translation.
I'm studying English at home.
Please make yourself comfortable.
She promised not to be late again.
I don't want to be a teacher.
I don't have it yet.
He got hurt when he fell down.
I'm going to go shopping.
Tom can't swim very well yet.
Everyone knows I'm Tom's girlfriend.
I really love my grandmother.
My room looks out on the street.
"Someone, open the door."
No one has ever seen God.
What Tom said really hurt me.
Tom is in church.
She was careful opening the drawer.
The sunny side of the hill is full of deciduous trees.
Tom is the one who made that decision.
The children are playing with blocks.
Is Tom a fun guy?
It is difficult to convey the meaning exactly.
Do you know how to make paper airplanes?
I'd like to visit Boston someday.
This is my father's.
I'm afraid something is wrong with my watch.
Tom said he'd help us tomorrow.
I wish I could become a bird.
You must be kidding!
The reception room is empty.
"Melt the chocolate, add the butter and stir well."
What're you guys looking for?
That book had a lot of pages.
Was Tom surprised?
I aimed my gun at the target.
"It's a beautiful day, isn't it?"
It is snowing now.
Something seems to be wrong with my clock.
What a big dog that is!
How old are Tom's parents?
I may be late for dinner.
Tom likes Mary a lot.
I'm sorry. I overestimated my abilities.
My pants are wet.
I love you.
The dog is dead.
He didn't go there.
The driver fell asleep at the wheel.
Help me move it out of the way.
What do you want to do this weekend?
There's somebody coming up the stairs.
Could you wrap it as a gift?
He can ride a horse.
Where's the nearest bar?
He had no sooner gone out of the room than all of them burst out laughing.
Life in the country is not always tranquil.
This coat is baggy on me.
Just go away.
My mother is older than my father.
I'm going to see a movie tomorrow with a friend.
The guide led us to the hotel.
She is paralyzed in both legs.
How old will you be next year?
I hate jealous women.
I have been in the hospital for the last month.
I'm calling from Tom's.
He couldn't come because he was sick.
He gave an excuse about why he had been absent.
Tom was holding a small box in his hands.
I would rather stay here.
Tom majored in French.
I saw a strange woman there.
I have a few chores that need to be done.
They kept him waiting outside for a long time.
Tom was arrested on Monday.
Are you happy with the service?
My father is two years younger than my mother.
I worked hard last month.
It cost me one thousand yen to get the bicycle fixed.
He is in his early twenties.
There is a bank in front of the station.
"I should've kept my mouth shut, right?"
Would you believe me if I told you I loved you?
Diapers are expensive.
Is somebody there?
Did you study French yesterday?
Memories of the good old days came flooding back one after another.
He crossed the river.
They refused.
She rents a room to a student.
I hit the gym two or three times a week.
Tom appears to be a bit nervous.
That's a waste of time.
Supposedly it's going to rain soon.
How can I help you today?
He is the only American who has swum the English Channel.
Is there anybody here?
You should apologize to Dad for not coming home in time for supper.
Tom didn't call the doctor.
I'd like to buy a rice cooker.
I hate to improvise.
"You're pretty calm, cool and collected for somebody who has a major presentation tomorrow."
The nurse took my blood pressure.
I don't want to do that right now.
Do you have a pet?
I don't remember saying I like Tom.
He will get nowhere with his plans.
Tom got furious.
Traveling by boat takes longer than going by car.
Why didn't you wash your hands?
I've been wearing this denim jacket for 15 years now.
I watched them demolish that old building.
Hold this ladder steady.
I want to say one thing.
I'm sorry that I kept you waiting.
I can't concentrate if you keep tapping me on the shoulder.
Tom was expelled from school for breaking school rules.
What's the time in Boston now?
I'm extremely tired.
Tom put on his Sunday best.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
Tom took his son to work.
The ambassador returned.
We're finding it difficult deciding on which one to buy.
I ate half the bread.
Someone ate all my cupcakes.
I'm planning to stay at a five-star hotel.
I think that maybe Tom was right.
This skirt is cheap.
Tom bought us some sandwiches.
I was having lunch.
What do you think of it?
I don't see any reason why I have to apologize.
It wasn't simply by coincidence that Tom and Mary both happened to be there.
How's work going?
Tom was the only one who laughed.
Do you want to sit down?
It was only a partial success.
"To hear him talk, you might think he's a girl."
Tom likes to sit on the floor.
I don't want to eat here.
"Thanks to a cold summer, beer has sold poorly."
It's been stolen.
How are things at school?
She waited for him for hours.
I'm taking a couple of days off.
Where does all your confidence come from?
Read my lips.
Are you planning to go abroad?
"Thanks. ""For what?"" ""For everything."""
We got this chair for nothing because the lady next door didn't need it anymore.
Tom began to sweat like a pig.
One learns from one's own mistakes.
A page is missing.
"Some children brought peanut butter sandwiches, some ham, and others cheese."
"Mom, where can we play ball?"
I put the flowers in the vase.
I'm only here for the weekend.
The export of arms was not allowed.
The data hasn't been compiled yet.
I didn't catch what he said.
Japanese is our mother tongue.
"Frankly speaking, Tom's speeches are always boring."
Do you want to be my friend?
Playing badminton is a lot of fun.
We had no choice but to wait for a while until the store opened.
A cat was sitting on the chair.
I plan to go skiing with my girlfriend.
I used to play tennis after school.
I don't like iced coffee.
It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella.
I love reading books.
He walked at a quick pace.
"If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes."
Let me go just once.
"I'll wash the dishes. ""OK, I'll dry then."""
Why won't you eat dinner with us?
"Will you keep my valuables for me, please?"
Tom wants to live in the country.
I have no idea who she is.
A true friendship is more valuable than money.
"This is a secret, so please don't tell anyone."
Are you still up?
Please come. I really want to meet you.
I live from hand to mouth.
Your advice is always helpful to me.
I'm very grateful to you for your help.
Are you hurt?
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.
Looks like today will be a long day.
My lips are sealed.
It's cold around here.
It'll be impossible to get a visa on short notice.
He is not qualified for the job.
The game was rained out.
I want to change my image.
He threw a rock into the pond.
My neck is stiff.
It's cloudy today.
The last time I saw Tom was in Boston.
Tom borrowed money from a loan shark.
There are many birds in this forest.
Tom worked at a hospital.
I've lost my key.
You should take a shower.
I'm sure Tom will come to the party.
I still can't remember what Tom told me to do.
She had a basket full of apples.
You can read a lot more than you think you can.
"You took a nap, didn't you?"
"Are you going to Australia next summer, too?"
I want to make sure I'm not overestimating my abilities.
What's this called?
I can't stand this cold.
He is her friend.
"Tom did the right thing, I think."
The car turned to the left.
I don't think I can get along with him.
I didn't make the train.
He lives here all alone.
Please fill out this form and wait for us to notify you.
I ate leftovers for lunch.
We practiced very hard to beat them.
What kind of songs do you like?
"Within a month of going abroad, Tom became sick."
Mary is too stubborn to apologize.
I can't do it.
Are there survivors?
Tom has got a cold.
Are you feeling OK?
Both of us were drunk.
I'm content with my current position.
Tom is older than I thought.
Tom prefers mechanical pencils.
The cause of Tom's illness was overeating.
"For here, or to go?"
Are you all still cold?
I love to travel.
Have any letters arrived for me?
I need to clear my head.
There's no one at work but me.
It's urgent.
He would be glad to hear that.
"A vodka martini, please."
I have to look after this cat.
He had his parents die in the plane accident.
Thank you for loving me.
I live with Tom.
I watched the news on TV after supper.
Will you turn on the light?
I hard-boiled an egg.
Tom is somewhat like my father.
No one believed Tom's story.
I'm smarter than you are.
He passed through the woods.
Try to jump as high as possible.
Spring is finally here.
I want to get as much information as possible.
He kept on crying.
What do you want for Christmas?
I'm tired now.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
"When I got to school, the race had already finished."
"If you keep on like this, you'll probably live to reach 120!"
Tom likes lacrosse.
I had breakfast at 7:30.
Tom doesn't laugh at all.
Beef is very expensive.
I did without heating all through the winter.
I don't know my way around Boston.
Did you stop at the red light?
Please give me some airsickness medicine.
Let's go back to the hotel.
It wasn't my fault.
"If you're done with the salt, please pass it to me."
I'm sure Tom will pass the upcoming exam.
Hello.
Tom doesn't do that very often.
I thought that system was abolished last year.
What's his name?
I was born and raised in Tokyo.
The teacher caught a student cheating in the exam.
Could you say that again?
I don't want to get married too early.
The door was locked and we couldn't get in.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I doubt it'll snow tomorrow.
I want to congratulate you on your graduation.
I'm at school.
"It's a lot of trouble to write my name, because it takes 50 strokes to write both my first and last names."
He kept on singing.
Do it as soon as possible.
The boy kept quiet.
Tom's lonely.
I slapped him.
Tom and Mary just started dating.
I'm not sure when he'll come.
The windows are open.
Is Tom around?
"Even though Tom knew that he'd be teased about his height, he decided to try out for the basketball team."
I saw you driving by my house this morning.
Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is the most famous formula in the world.
I'm afraid I won't be able to take part in the meeting tonight.
Tom swims very fast.
Is it true that Tom kissed you?
"After six hours' climbing, we finally succeeded in reaching the top of the mountain."
He adapted himself to his new life.
"Tom is the one with the car, not me."
My heart was filled with happiness.
The swimming event was called off.
I need a tissue.
"How do you say ""yuri"" in English?"
She has spent hours at the gym trying to lose weight.
These toys are very popular.
He's an expert in economics.
"If you hurt her, I'll kill you."
I should have left earlier.
I have left my car keys behind.
"Wherever he may go, he is sure to make friends."
Our school adopted his teaching methods.
Is it open yet?
I went to school in my pajamas.
"When my mother was young, she was very beautiful."
We have a reservation for six-thirty.
What did you have for lunch today?
Tom wanted a bigger discount.
You can do whatever you want to do.
Did you know Tom was Mary's ex-husband?
I don't know anything about Tom's past.
In which folder did you save the file?
"Because of the storm, the ship couldn't leave port."
I didn't think you were supposed to be here.
I'll take it home with me.
Did anyone phone you?
I know Tom is very busy.
Tom asked me why I could swim so fast.
The sun sank below the horizon before I knew it.
Ignore it. It's only a rumor.
Why do you have a picture of Tom in your wallet?
I want to master French.
I'm very glad to meet you.
"If you want to sing, sing."
I don't like learning irregular verbs.
"No matter how much I think about it, I don't understand it."
Tom said he didn't know if Mary could do that.
How often have you been vomiting?
The noise kept me from sleeping last night.
I ran into Mary at a party last week.
"Wherever you go, I'll follow."
I remember what he said.
Tom was never able to walk again.
I hear you have friends in the CIA.
It is about time you went to school.
You made the right call.
I'd appreciate your help.
This medicine doesn't have side effects.
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.
I'm in favor of the proposition.
Tom and Mary have just started dating.
Was it Tom who ate my sandwich?
"Excuse me, but could you tell me where the post office is?"
God created man in his own image.
The distance is hard to estimate.
We had no school on account of the typhoon.
You must make your parents happy.
She is dressed like a bride.
Are Tom and Mary still at work?
Is Mary Tom's mother?
Not many dogs are this big.
Let me congratulate you on your marriage.
He is an old friend of mine.
Children often wet their beds at night.
My grandmother suffers from osteoporosis.
Let's clean the entire office next Saturday.
"She waved her hand to me, smiling brightly."
Don't cut down this tree.
Where did they teach you that?
These children are my grandchildren.
He has already gone to bed.
"Luckily, the treatment wasn't harmful. It was just ineffective."
A few students were left behind.
The smell of raw fish nauseates me.
Tom heard the scream.
I can't live on ten thousand yen a month.
I've got to go to the bank.
I accidentally deleted everything.
Dry your eyes.
Mr. Jackson is the principal of the high school that Tom goes to.
Today there were no visitors.
Tom is in the hospital now.
He burst into tears.
Please freeze the fish and meat.
There's an old castle at the foot of the mountain.
What could've made Tom do that?
We had a lot of rain last month.
Can you help me?
The rumor may be true.
Is there something you want to buy?
She's three years older than I am.
She is apt to lose her temper.
May I cut in?
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
"How are you doing, Tom?"
I had a blast.
What a big eater he is!
Is it true Mary sold her wedding dress to Alice?
Tom is always here on Mondays.
Did you turn off the light in the living room?
No alcohol is allowed on campus.
You should've telephoned in advance.
Tom is studying alone.
There's no one at work but me.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
He was sitting on a bench.
I owe you one.
A number of cars are parked in front of my house.
Who wants some hot chocolate?
What made her do so?
The fire went out by itself.
He kept on smoking all the time.
Don't ask me such difficult questions.
Mary kissed my cheek.
I'll see you next week.
We'll get a phone call from Tom tonight for sure.
I often go yachting on weekends.
"General Motors laid off 76,000 workers."
Cross out the incorrect words.
"Give me a glass of water, please."
Nobody equals him in strength.
It looks easy when you do it.
Tom always keeps a set of jumper cables in the trunk of his car.
Can you tell me which button to press?
I'll help you.
I will accompany you.
That's my book.
It was a quiet night.
I don't hold grudges.
Please hurry up!
Tom bought a new house.
He got over the shock of his father's death.
Don't you have a driver's license?
What did Tom tell you he had to do?
Mary is Tom's mother-in-law.
He calculated the speed of light.
She's always smiling.
It was not clear what she said.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I wasn't in the mood.
She went inside.
I'd appreciate it if you'd turn off the lights.
Tom caught a glimpse of the driver as the train raced past.
"You must take this medicine, whether you like it or not."
This custom dates back to the 12th century.
He went there instead of his father.
When will you come back?
"As soon as the child saw his mother, he stopped crying."
Tom and Mary sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
Tom and Mary have been married for more than thirty years.
The line is engaged.
Our school was established in 1951.
I'm afraid he is ill.
Tom killed himself three months ago.
I have a sharp pain here.
They don't take care of that dog.
Did you return Tom's books?
What do ostriches eat?
I just want to sleep.
She is first in line.
You're selfish.
What were you doing?
I couldn't attend the ceremony.
Last night there was a fire in the neighborhood.
Father set the alarm for six o'clock.
The earth goes around the sun.
You'll get a lot of presents on your birthday.
I have a very old stamp.
I can't live without a TV.
What was your name?
"You speak French, right?"
I became aware of someone looking at me.
How far is it from here to your house?
You should get more rest.
I don't have much money.
I want you to understand what I'm trying to say.
That house belongs to me.
There is one book here.
Is there anything else you want to ask?
Thirteen passengers were hospitalized.
Have you fed the dog yet?
We both love poetry.
I didn't know that you were so good at cooking.
It's not very nice.
The fat woman was holding a monkey.
He pointed out that the plan would cost a lot of money.
Everyone died.
Tom can run much faster than I can.
This book is too difficult for me to read.
That was easier than I expected.
Tomorrow's Monday.
I have poor eyesight.
The electricity has been off since this morning.
The accident happened on a rainy day.
Tom spoke French.
"My name is Tom, not John."
It was too difficult for me.
I'll never forget you.
Everyone knows that Tom likes Mary.
I thought you didn't know anything about lacrosse.
We were held up for two hours on account of the accident.
Did you ride your bike yesterday?
It's impossible for me to believe what you are saying.
Don't do anything rash.
Warn Tom.
How was today's game?
Did you study hard in high school?
Tom put a new roll of film into his camera.
I was watching TV when the phone rang.
Just go home.
It's no use complaining.
It's scorching hot.
The bullet penetrated his chest.
This is the book Tom and I were talking about.
I'd like to reserve a single room.
I'm starving.
Is the party over?
I like this one best.
Japan began to import rice from the United States.
I didn't drink coffee today.
This is too difficult for me.
I have no money with me.
We went skiing in Canada.
Just don't tell anybody what I said.
Neither Tom nor Mary plays the clarinet.
Do you have any complaints?
How long have you lived here?
We had to postpone the gathering because of rain.
Is eating raw eggs safe?
"He's young, but he's very intelligent."
I'm exhausted.
I found the game very exciting.
"If anyone calls me up while I'm away, tell them I'll be back by five."
I work best under pressure.
A boat suddenly appeared out of the mist.
That rings a bell.
You're the only one who can help us.
I paid her five dollars.
She got on her bike and rode away.
Tell me.
Isn't it true?
I had never seen so many squirrels in my life.
I always walk to school.
Would it be better if I spoke French?
This book has many pictures.
The wind has started picking up.
Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.
What happened to you yesterday?
Tom won.
I'm living in the city.
I managed to get to the station on time.
Don't change horses midstream.
Do you want to be my girlfriend?
You know what I mean.
It has snowed for two days.
Where do I get on the number 7 bus?
It's time to hit the road.
"What's the name of that store again, please?"
There used to be a bridge here.
"She advised him to go to the hospital, but he didn't follow her advice."
It's not cold in the house.
Let's play tennis after school.
The military engaged the enemy five kilometers south of the capital.
"Tom is young, but he isn't innocent."
I was absent from school yesterday.
Avoid fried foods for a while.
He has strange ideas.
My vacation went by quickly.
Can I ask you a question?
I don't want to lose my boyfriend.
I felt guilty.
Tom is watching the Olympics on TV.
The thunder scared the children.
They already got married.
I've lost a little weight.
I met Tom in the winter three years ago.
Do you know the real facts?
I prefer raw almonds.
Many thanks.
The rumor quickly spread.
Is this the first time that you've been here?
It seemed that no one was in the village.
Tom said no one was in a hurry.
Tom leads a quiet life.
I overslept this morning.
I believe in love at first sight.
She was such a beautiful girl that everybody turned to look at her as she passed.
I never considered myself a good actor.
I'm on top of the world.
Tom is as tall as his father.
I can do without his help.
I'm glad Tom found his keys.
May I see your ID?
Everybody smiled.
I lost my purse.
You're bad.
Say cheese.
I'm sleepy.
I didn't eat anything for six days.
We saw a dim light in the darkness.
Tom is past thirty.
Are you a real doctor?
I've quit smoking and drinking.
It is about the size of an egg.
I need to search for my pen.
A good cook doesn't throw out yesterday's soup.
She's already introduced herself.
I'm very grateful to you.
A truck ran over our dog.
Tom is in a bad mood.
This puzzle has 500 pieces.
She hung a curtain over the window.
Why don't you admit your mistake?
There's a bank in front of the station.
I went hiking with the group.
I am not now in a position to help you.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
This watch is made in Japan.
She did nothing but look around.
He's as strong as a horse.
There are thirty people on board.
She misses him.
We should make every effort to maintain world peace.
I have a bath almost every day.
I hope that you get better soon.
Some wild animals are on the verge of extinction.
There were many things in the room.
Tom isn't a soldier.
I'm going to go for a walk on the beach after class.
The doctor might've said that.
"Would you leave the door open, please?"
The story seems true.
A horse kicked Tom.
"Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the bus stop?"
I really don't understand French.
Tell me what you did in Tokyo.
What brings you to Boston?
Some things are better left unsaid.
My father grows rice.
Why don't we take a walk?
It was yesterday that Tom broke the window.
I have to study for the test.
Everyone started to laugh.
It's good that you were able to achieve your goals.
The rumor isn't true.
Can I carry this on the plane?
Tom has no wish to study.
There is a vase on the table.
"Could you show me another one, please?"
I could swim faster when I was young.
I think you worry too much.
It is raining hard.
There's a tablecloth on the table.
I have a feeling that I've been here before.
I can't go there unless I go with Tom.
Can I borrow three hundred dollars?
"I'm sorry, I dropped my knife."
He's a tennis player.
I'm building a birdhouse.
We're flying over the Pacific.
He's friendly with everyone in his class.
Do you know what I'm thinking?
He skipped a grade.
Is your teacher strict?
A bill came along with the package.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
How about a rain check?
A new model isn't necessarily any better than the older one.
I have to go to Boston with Tom.
I could not make myself understood in English.
Roses smell nice.
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the robbery.
"This one's crowded, so let's take the next train."
That chicken was very tasty.
Did Tom go swimming with you?
I was surprised you won the prize.
Your shipment should be delivered within twenty-four hours.
What are these for?
We've known each other since we were children.
Tom has a reputation for always being late.
I don't think that Tom will be using this.
This is really cute.
Is this good or bad?
I like the smell of fresh bread.
What kind of equipment is installed in the classrooms?
"If I had known about your illness, I could have visited you in the hospital."
It's really good.
Tom helped.
Tom is the only one not invited to my party.
I will be with you right away.
We went to the museum.
I find it crazy that Tom did that.
Can you do me a favor?
I've come to see the sights.
The lion lay in the middle of the cage.
How do I get reimbursed?
Tom is small for his age.
Tom's died.
Why don't you take a break?
The reason I don't do it is because I don't feel like doing it.
I wanted to make new friends.
I couldn't see any stars in the sky.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
Tom's condition has worsened.
Nothing is as precious as love.
"You aren't going to give up, are you?"
"May I see your driver's license, sir?"
You must do your homework at once.
What do you consider your greatest achievement?
I suppose so.
Do you smoke cigarettes?
It's wonderful.
I wouldn't recommend that.
I think that Tom really likes you.
Tom often plays solitaire.
I've never shot anyone.
We cook rice in a rice cooker.
They missed the train.
I only come once in a blue moon.
I've got to go to the hospital.
What presents did you get for Christmas?
Children are a poor man's riches.
His story wasn't appropriate for the occasion.
Are we moving?
The problem is not as simple as it might seem at first sight.
The breaded pork cutlet they serve in Tom's company cafeteria is so crispy and delicious.
Mary looks like she's mad.
I'm really glad to see you.
Not many people are talking about it.
I bought sandals.
I don't understand this sentence.
"I was going to speak to his father about that matter, but thought better of it."
Tom was relieved to see that Mary was OK.
It's as lovely as a rose.
Tom said that he wanted to take a shower before going to bed.
He warned us not to enter the room.
Do you want a trim?
It's almost seven o'clock. I have to go to school
You won't believe what happened.
I'd be delighted to sing for you.
The shower doesn't work.
Everybody knows two and two make four.
What's a UFO?
I think Tom did the right thing.
"I'm not good at swimming. ""Neither am I."""
Our house is large enough for five of us.
He is not ashamed of his misconduct.
I'm very sensitive to heat.
You must apologize for what you said.
"That wasn't so hard, was it?"
It's time to go to bed.
They stayed at the hotel for a week.
He denied knowing anything about their plans.
My cellphone's battery is dead.
I wish I'd been born a man.
Would you introduce yourself?
You're on the right track.
He is breathing hard.
I called him up.
"You've never been on a date, have you?"
I won't see her anymore.
Call me when you're finished.
I can't remember how to spell her name.
I read everything.
It's pretty easy to imagine.
I don't want to speak with Tom.
I don't think I can eat all this.
The road came to a dead end.
Please tell Tom Mary called.
We'll paint it.
Tom believes that ghosts exist.
Please keep the door closed.
I would rather not go shopping alone.
Wild rabbits can be seen in the forest.
I've decided.
The photo was a hoax.
The tree's leaves have all fallen.
Tom was covered with mud.
Where can I buy tickets?
I go to bed very early.
There used to be a big pine tree in front of my house.
I'm tired of TV.
The writing was illegible.
The food is getting cold.
He doesn't work here anymore.
I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.
I have to go to bed.
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
I spend at least three hours a week studying French.
Would you like to eat this?
I can't do two things at the same time.
I'll bring you the bill immediately.
"Do you have kids? ""Yes, I have a son."""
Don't open this door.
Try us again next Monday.
I thought you were going to come straight home.
Everybody knew Tom was good at French.
Do you know where your father went?
Can I park here?
I'm very pleased that your dream came true.
I'll write it on the blackboard.
I'm not the kind of person you think I am.
He is every inch a gentleman.
I feel like another person.
Cool down.
I'm walking with her.
Can you play basketball well?
Do you have some milk?
I have my doubts about that.
There was no money left in my wallet.
Cut the meat into thin strips.
Soldiers are used to danger.
I prefer to shower in the morning.
Smoking isn't permitted here.
That was the answer I wanted.
Are you friends with Tom?
There's a post office in front of the station.
It is soft to the touch.
His concert was great.
He managed to pass his driving test even though he was a poor driver.
My shoulders hurt.
Tom bought the cheapest one in the store.
"For you, I'll gladly do it."
Tom said he needed a dozen eggs.
Please don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.
I can't stand his behavior anymore.
What's next on the schedule?
I'm getting sleepy. I should've gone to bed earlier last night.
The old are not always wiser than the young.
Tom is ill.
What did Tom buy for you?
He asked for a glass of beer.
Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
Mary was happy to be reunited with her boyfriend.
Was it in October that your baby was born?
This is a picture of my wife.
Are you coming to my party?
The news can't be true.
Tom has a sore throat.
The students answered in order.
Tom phoned.
That'll put you in danger.
She sold her company to him.
How about a walk?
Tomorrow's weather should be sunny with occasional rain.
I'm in no position to do anything about it.
My hobby is playing the guitar.
Please sign here.
Tom worried about Mary.
My screen is cracked.
I'm pretty sure Tom lied to Mary.
There's a pen between the apple and the book.
Very few people know how to do that.
It's just started snowing.
She's more wise than clever.
This is our friend Tom.
I went shopping near the station yesterday.
Tom used to take a walk every morning before breakfast.
It happened in 2013.
I don't like coffee.
Only three people thought it was a good idea.
Sorry for all the typos.
Do I need to transfer?
He wears glasses.
It looks as if it's going to rain.
Tom and Mary drank a whole bottle of wine by themselves.
I met him at the end of the platform.
"That's not the problem. ""Then what's wrong?"""
The forest was very still.
There used to be big trees around the pond.
You must keep your room clean.
You'd better not see her now.
It was stupid of you to believe in him.
We're looking forward to the holidays.
Don't ever lie to me again.
Please don't waste water.
What'll you be doing this weekend?
I've been extremely busy lately.
You're the only person I know that has ever visited Boston.
Shall I close the door?
"When you come to Boston, I'll show you around."
Is that why you came here?
Don't say anything that might get you into trouble.
Don't touch the pot with bare hands.
There was nothing left in the refrigerator.
Tom opened the door slowly.
What makes you laugh?
Who are you laughing at?
The grass is always greener on the other side.
I can swim across the river.
She's smarter than him.
I'm a freshman.
The can is empty.
I'm studying very hard.
Eat wherever you want to.
Take as much as you like.
We've had a lot of rain this year.
He did not speak unless spoken to.
Sweet dreams.
"Can you open the door for me, please?"
"Has anybody called the police? ""I have."""
I don't think you're crazy.
"Tom is part of the team, too."
Don't give me that!
Are you on duty tonight?
I'd say no if I were you.
It's getting better.
I knew in advance what Tom was going to say.
He lives there alone.
You smoke too much. You should cut back.
Are you interested in football?
I'm looking for an apartment to rent.
Tom married a girl much younger than himself.
She took off the lid of the box.
"Speak slower, please."
"Rain or shine, I will come to meet you at the station."
What were you two doing together?
Tom is looking for work.
"I, too, am a teacher."
I'm getting sick of hearing you complain.
The world has changed.
No way!
Mary is going to have a baby next month.
Keep it up!
Tokyo has a larger population than London.
Why would you want to talk to Tom about that?
I like beef more than anything.
Tom deleted my message without ever reading it.
Come whenever you want.
My mother is strict about manners.
May I try that on?
We found a nail stuck in the tire.
Tom says he has nothing to do.
It rained continuously for three days.
Do you know what you're saying?
Tom's blood type is A.
I hurried to the bus stop so I wouldn't miss the last bus.
I'm used to the heat.
It's wrong to steal.
He has a lot of money.
Tom helped his son change into his pajamas.

Do you like this color?
Tom spent Christmas on his own.
Tom has a house which has two rooms.
I got a C in English.
"Clearly, the rumor isn't true."
Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.
"It smells good, doesn't it?"
Just close your eyes.
Tom and Mary often eat lunch together.
I hate Mondays.
Any student can answer that question.
Are you afraid of me?
Gold is heavier than silver.
"Being very tired, I went to bed early."
I've been waiting for a friend of mine for an hour.
I like the way you smile.
"Tom, is there something you want to say?"
I went up to the 5th floor in an elevator.
I want to become a doctor.
That hotel is very close to the station.
This is a quiet street.
"Generally, men are taller than women."
Tom bought that.
Do you need anything else?
"I lived in Tokyo a few years ago, but now I live in Kyoto."
Tom and Mary aren't home.
Cars made in Japan are used all over the world.
I think Tom looked happy.
That isn't original.
Is it okay if I take a break?
There's no use waiting for Tom any longer.
Let's say I fix the pipe. How much will you pay me?
I don't care about your past.
I did some work after breakfast and went out.
Every student who has graduated from our university has studied English with a native speaker for at least two years.
This watch keeps accurate time.
She has an eye for beauty.
Tom pokes his nose into everything.
The children are blowing bubbles.
The nation as a whole is in favor of political reform.
We drank shochu at the karaoke bar.
"Long story short, I was fired."
She advised him to go abroad while he was still young.
His chances of being elected are good.
She lived a happy life.
Thank you very much for everything.
Is that Tom's car?
I wish I could make up for lost time.
Beware of pickpockets here.
Let's go by the church.
I’m on a diet right now.
She begged him to stay.
I hid under the table.
"May I have your name, please?"
I don't like cheese very much.
We all like you a lot.
She did not say anything.
The school custodian cleans the gym in the evening.
I'll be your first patient.
I don't get modern jazz.
Does Tom really live alone?
Tom goes to Boston every once in a while.
"Excuse me, but might I use the phone?"
Tom was transferred to the head office in Boston.
My mother is not at home.
I wish I had known his name then.
Tom and Mary sat on the park bench.
The shelves were empty.
Please get this work finished by Monday.
You must go through with your plan.
He is afraid of making mistakes.
They defended their country.
I can't tell you everything.
"You're tired, aren't you?"
I meet Tom once every three months.
Do you want to spend the rest of your life in jail?
Tom asked Mary to drive John to the airport.
We have five classes every day except Saturday.
Mom made me lunch.
Who will you give the book to?
Tom climbed up the rope ladder.
"No matter how much she eats, she never gains weight."
Wait just a moment.
The bad weather prevented us from leaving.
I'm leaving in the afternoon.
I've already done it.
It's just time for children to go to bed.
May I borrow your eraser?
Tomorrow is another day.
Did anyone get injured?
It's so peaceful.
"When I was a kid, touching bugs didn't bother me a bit. Now I can hardly stand looking at pictures of them."
I'll explain it to her.
Let's think about next year next year.
"What do you think of the election for mayor? ""I don't know."""
She announced her engagement to her lawyer friend.
You did it!
Tom sides with Mary all the time.
I can't keep up with you.
I have a banana and a pineapple.
We used the computer in order to save time.
He's three years older than I am.
Tom isn't old enough to drink.
He's just kidding you.
Tom is in charge of this project.
I'm in love with her.
The line is busy.
The work is done.
I don't like being made a fool of.
Tom is shorter than I am.
She turned pale at the news.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
Someone told Tom the truth.
"May I use this pencil? ""Yes, you may."""
"Today, I went to the doctor's."
She turned to the left at the corner.
Be nice to your little brother.
Put your suitcase over here.
He had one daughter.
A strange thing happened.
There's no time like the present.
"Are you a teacher? ""Yes, I am."""
I'm considering going with them.
Life is long.
I found a good Mexican restaurant.
We went out for a walk after dinner.
"When it rains, Tom takes the bus."
I'm looking forward to the summer break.
Please stop using that term.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
I don't feel anything.
Choose any dress you like.
I saw Tom cry.
"Once a bad habit is formed, it's hard to get rid of it."
I wanted to show it to you.
Tom thinks Mary always packs way too much in her suitcase.
This is a difficult question.
She was afraid to pass through the woods.
It's serious.
Did the umbrella you found belong to Tom?
I don't want a bag.
This picture reminds me of when I was a student.
Belgium is not as big as France.
I didn't get them.
Did you go bowling yesterday?
I can now take care of myself.
I must do my homework.
"If you do it at all, do it well."
What do you plan to do tomorrow?
The police kept looking for a stolen article for about one month.
We live in the country.
Tom should've known better.
Please take me to the Hilton Hotel.
This strawberry juice also contains bits of strawberries.
Our request for a pay raise was turned down.
These flowers here are more beautiful than those over there.
Pay more attention to intonation when you speak English.
He works in the planning section.
It is our policy not to give out personal information.
Don't look at me that way.
Tom will be very angry.
It isn't usually this busy.
Whose guitar is this?
Nobody knows who'll win the next race.
Could you please say that again?
Take it easy.
This food is unhealthy.
He turned to his friends for help.
My father bought a bicycle for me.
Is your school far from your home?
I can't wait to see you guys again in October.
We burned the old books.
I thought as much.
I got home exhausted today.
You need to hit the gym.
This looks interesting.
You mustn't tell anyone.
"Of course, I'm going to do that."
I would love a cold glass of beer.
This peach tart is tasty.
There's no more money in my wallet.
I tried not to yawn.
I'm going to come to Boston in October.
You should have a doctor check you out.
"You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?"
What do you want for dinner?
CDs have taken the place of records.
You're the tallest.
Are you home?
I think that the snow will melt soon.
Tom grew up in the same orphanage as Mary.
She'll succeed for sure.
I went home to change clothes.
We climbed higher so that we might get a better view.
Did you receive your flu shot this season?
"Write me sometime, OK?"
Don't you see what's happened?
The pizza's here.
Why aren't you wearing your glasses?
Everybody knew Tom could speak French well.
What did you say your name was?
I looked at the price tag.
Can you give me a discount?
I saw a man standing naked under the waterfall.
He has excellent reflexes.
I enjoyed your company.
I contributed.
Tom looks pale.
I identify with you.
I think Tom is hard-working.
Tom doesn't like cats very much.
She comes from a good family.
I won't do anything.
"If you could assist me, it would be a great help."
I'm too tired to walk any more.
I'm not on good terms with my family.
I need a bigger chair.
I need a tie.
Don't ask me to choose between you and my job.
She calls him every night.
Tom can speak French as well as English.
He took out some coins.
She is my dream girl.
Lots of people in Japan are indifferent to politics.
She accepted our invitation.
Would you mind not smoking?
Do you like Japanese food?
I was very happy when I heard that news.
There is a restaurant on the top floor.
What do seagulls eat?
Tom is an excellent tennis player.
Many boys and girls ranging from 12 to 18 entered the contest.
We're worried about Grandma and Grandpa.
Tom hit a triple.
You know that's a lie.
He is a brave man.
I don't feel much like eating.
Please have somebody else do that.
He talks a lot.
I thought you said you used to live in Boston.
I was too surprised to speak.
Mary said that Tom was smarter than she was.
It's a big decision.
I don't regret what I did.
I wish I were a little taller.
Tom told me he couldn't speak French.
I am leaving town for a few days.
It's a long way to the station.
Tom gained weight.
It was not until I visited Australia that I realized how small Japan was.
I will be waiting for the bus at seven.
The man denied having stolen the car.
You lost the game.
You should drink a lot of liquid.
Are Tom and Mary both still busy?
It wasn't until I read the book that I knew about it.
"The work wasn't finished at 11:00 p.m. Friday, so they decided to carry it over to the following Monday."
I spent the whole day cleaning up the room.
How much is this pen?
I know what Tom is doing here.
I want to learn French.
I want to wash myself.
Do you know where she is?
Can I hear your comments about this?
Both of you be quiet.
I think I'll go out to eat.
I hate dancing.
They have their own troubles.
"Excuse me, what time is it?"
When will the party take place?
Tom switched on the TV.
Are you from around here?
It might rain tomorrow.
What's so fun about taking pictures of trains?
I'd like to go somewhere without many people.
"According to the paper, there was an earthquake last night."
This is about as large as that.
Don't treat me as if I were a child.
He found it very difficult to adjust himself to life in the new school.
Can he play the guitar?
She cannot have told a lie.
In front of the train station there's a bank.
Is this pen Tom's?
This product was made in China.
Would you like a chocolate chip cookie?
There are books here.
Was Tom's room clean?
I need to know your answer by Friday.
I can't stand guys like that.
Tom is from Australia.
I slept very well.
I'll call you when I get the results of the examination.
"It's perfect, if I do say so myself."
"To tell the truth, I couldn't finish it in time."
We went out for some fresh air.
"Whether rains or not, the game is going to be held."
"If you hurry, there's a chance you can catch the bus."
May I call at around 2:30?
How long will it take by plane?
I can't stay long.
Would you mind turning down the volume?
Tom was good at violin.
She ate the apple.
"Grades are important, but they're not everything."
Tom doesn't want Mary to go.
I want to eat ice cream.
"Tom, are you asleep?"
Do you play an instrument?
This is the last time I'll ask you to do anything.
I'm in Boston now.
Tom wants to go by train.
I have to call someone.
You never talk about your wife.
We need to hire somebody who speaks French.
Please take me along with you.
"Next week, we can probably do it."
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
It's chilly.
Tom has friends all over the world.
The fog was thickening quickly.
The flowers have wilted.
I have no more than three thousand yen.
There's an emergency.
She always thinks she's right.
I've got no more than five hundred yen.
"I was just going out, when it began to rain."
I wish I were Canadian.
We have to look into the disappearance of the doctor.
We'll go when it stops raining.
Do you need the car?
My parents live in the country.
Today I won't be going to church.
Can you lend me 500 yen?
I'm going home early today.
Whose camera is this?
I think Tom will say yes.
"No matter what, don't tell Tom."
"As for myself, Saturday will be convenient."
There are a lot of people waiting outside.
I can't live without music.
Tom suppressed a yawn.
Today is the first day of autumn.
She's eating an apple.
Am I on the wrong road?
Tom's parents moved to Australia.
We really like picnics a lot.
Mary talked with her friends about it.
The girls greeted us warmly.
He'll be back home soon.
Do you have many friends?
Why are you laughing?
There's no furniture left in the room.
Is that my fault?
The game has been postponed indefinitely.
It's cheap but very nutritious.
Let's begin with this problem.
It's not broken.
Tom's grinning.
What were you guys doing at that time?
Her party was really quite fun.
We have no chance of winning.
It is clear that he is guilty.
I want to go to school.
"One way or round trip? ""One way, please."""
"With the approach of Christmas, business improved somewhat."
I've got to do my homework now.
Tom is better at tennis than Mary.
I hope that you don't catch a cold.
I think I'm really not any good at French.
That was a very difficult exam.
I got off the train.
The ship sounded its whistle and pulled away from the pier.
Don't make a fool of me.
Tom is my right-hand man. I can really count on him.
Come quickly!
The kids were playing in the schoolyard.
Eggs are sold by the dozen.
Do what you want.
My father has recently returned to Japan.
I ran for mayor.
How much money is in your bank account right now?
You should exercise.
I put on my cap to go out.
My nose is itchy.
Tom and Mary are on bad terms.
I agree.
How long is that bridge?
Everybody is equal before the law.
I'll call Tom.
Each person has their own view of the world.
I have only just arrived.
He has a sense of humor.
Mary has beautiful long hair.
How would you like your eggs?
"Something's wrong, isn't it?"
Cats are very clean animals.
Both my mother and father were born in Boston.
It seems like you're not too interested.
He's not here yet.
He gave me some money.
Tom is laughing.
"Which do you like better, spring or autumn?"
We had to get up at dawn.
Japan's trade surplus soared to a record high.
I don't feel like meeting her now.
A truck got stuck on the railroad crossing.
I saw at once that he was ill at ease.
That's a secret.
"Given only thirty minutes, we couldn't answer all the questions."
"I like team sports like soccer, hockey, basketball, and volleyball."
It's not that far to the airport.
I wonder how long this rain'll last.
I bought milk at the supermarket today.
I arranged for a car to meet you at the airport.
I thought you guys were planning on coming to my party.
Tom always checks the caller ID before he answers the phone.
I believe that you will succeed.
We take off our shoes when entering a house.
Sit up straight.
Tom didn't start to study French until he was thirty.
I may have to go to Australia.
Is it safe to eat moldy bread?
It's so difficult that I've decided to give up trying.
Tom bought a new collar for his dog.
"First of all, you must look it up in the dictionary."
Tom shares a bedroom with his brother.
A good management would listen to reasonable demands.
They resolved to work harder.
She is capable of teaching English.
When is the next full moon?
Someone must have left the water running.
I can't do any more than that.
The bullet went through his body.
Are you still sleepy?
The storm prevented many planes from leaving the airport.
Tom isn't my sister's son. He's my son.
Please wake me up at seven tomorrow morning.
It was a strange story.
Few people think so.
"Needless to say, fundamental human rights should be respected."
We couldn't understand her logic.
Tom said that he would be thirteen next month.
How many times have you been there?
I was bitten by a moray eel.
Tom crashed his car the same day he bought it.
This asparagus is delicious.
Everybody needs something to believe in.
We had little rain last month.
I know Tom understands French.
I must apologize for the delay.
Is it my turn?
The moon was bright last night.
It is getting warmer and warmer day by day.
"You can't dance, can you?"
In all my travels I've never seen a more beautiful mountain than Everest.
Is it OK if I eat this bread?
There is nothing wrong with him.
He is not very good at mathematics.
I bought this book for 300 yen.
What were the chief events of 1990?
This book is much more interesting than that one.
We had a lot of rain last year.
"Finally, I finished a painting."
It is on me.
The population of Tokyo is larger than the population of London.
"So, what else did Tom tell you?"
The station is to the west of the hotel.
"I like grapes, but I can't eat too many of them."
Stock prices dropped.
I was brainwashed.
I was in danger of losing my life.
We love dogs.
This always happens.
I burned the newspaper.
My rucksack is very heavy.
"I don't want to sing, because I'm tone-deaf."
I'll be right there.
I think Tom is bored.
Try to smile.
I eat breakfast every morning.
Let me tell you a secret.
I feel uncomfortable in this kind of situation.
"That man is skinny, but his wife is fat."
I made a foolish mistake.
Have you ever lied to your boyfriend?
He acted quickly and put out the fire.
Will you take care of my dog while I'm away?
Is Tom home yet?
I want to go abroad someday.
I don't live here anymore.
I owe Mary some money and must pay her back by next Monday.
I don't know where my shoes are.
Are you doing anything special?
My glasses are fogging up.
There is no water left in the bottle.
We agree on this point.
I was asked to give you a message.
Turn off the light.
Stop criticizing me.
These photos have come out very well.
She was born in a small village.
You're still inexperienced.
Will we be in time for the concert?
He didn't catch the signal.
Thank you for your explanation.
Here's the key to your room.
You should study French harder.
Tom's hair is longer than Mary's.
Put the book on the bottom shelf.
I got a ticket for free.
Next time I'll come earlier.
He's used to climbing mountains.
Remember when we were little and played together?
I thought that you were going to fix the sink.
Do a better job next time.
None of their promises have been kept.
We have very strict rules here.
How will they amuse the children on a wet afternoon?
Tom is in London on business now.
Have you told anyone about this?
It took me more than three hours to translate this into French.
Where's this train going?
Would you like to go for coffee?
We need to buy a new carpet for this room.
I haven't decided yet whether I will attend the party.
Has a change in ocean currents occurred?
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends.
That box is too big to fit in the trunk.
I'm turning thirty this October.
I can hardly wait until tomorrow.
Nothing was to be heard except the sound of the waves.
None of those books are useful.
Tom isn't cute.
Tom ate instant ramen for lunch.
"When the war began, Tom was a little kid."
Don't do this.
Tom likes cheese.
Tom and Mary are a perfect couple.
It's too hard for me.
I went to the station to see my friend off.
I don't want Tom to make the same mistake I made.
Try on this shirt.
You will be better soon.
Leave it to me. I'll see to it.
You should relax a bit.
Tom is wearing shorts.
It's been thirty years since we got married.
"Probably, it'll snow tomorrow."
You can do this.
"May I have your order, please?"
Tom was very interested in sports when he was young.
She put her sweater on.
Please wait till noon.
My father didn't say anything.
Could you tell me which way I should go?
There are twenty-four hours in a day.
I got lucky.
Don't ever lie to me again.
I really like my coworkers.
My husband is always reading in bed.
I just want to see you happy.
There was nobody there.
It is not always easy to face reality.
I'm getting up early tomorrow.
This is a waste of time.
Were you ever good at sports?
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
I don't want to be a doctor.
"If you don't want to get married, it would be better if you didn't get married."
Tom arrived first.
I'm really not sure.
There's a skunk on the porch.
We grow rice.
Tom has narrow shoulders.
You're right.
Tell me how to do it.
The students are talking about language and culture.
Tom is a math geek.
"Don't worry, I'll translate that for you."
Tom asked me a lot of questions.
Tom had big blue eyes.
The birds are drinking water.
I'm firmly opposed to corporal punishment.
He isn't able to do it.
I want to rent a bigger apartment.
"If you're not watching the TV, I'll turn it off."
I've got an interview tomorrow.
Please help yourself to the fruit.
It was quite dark when I got home.
Everyone in the class has to learn the poem by heart.
Are there any good restaurants around here?
Tom got in the car.
Tom talks like a robot.
Do you think this is funny?
Someone stole Tom's bicycle.
Could I please borrow your pen?
Do you think you could make a little less noise?
We all try to get together at least once a year.
Tom has dogs.
How do I explain this?
Could you please open the curtains?
What does this mean?
We have to buy fruit and vegetables.
It's by no means impossible to earn one million yen a month.
French is Tom's mother tongue.
The garden was filled with flowers.
I've been living here for the past ten years.
"Because the surroundings were so dark, he could not see anything."
Where do the Jacksons live?
Tom waited until Mary was out of earshot before he started talking.
Please try the salad.
It was typical of him to arrive late.
Size does matter.
The enemy's attack ceased at dawn.
I have to go home a little early today.
This city isn't as busy as it used to be.
I've had coffee already.
It's the best I can do.
Tom doesn't know how much he drank.
What is in the desk?
"I have a fever, so I'm going to leave early."
I really like city life.
Tom is sitting at the table.
Do you know your height and weight?
The company president has hired a headhunter to find us a new sales manager.
I'm sure of his success.
I hurried home.
Which cup is yours?
The soldiers swam across the river.
I'll order this dish.
He speaks English.
I have nothing to do now.
Are you studying French?
Don't take off your mask.
Mary is a female name.
Tom was injured in a traffic accident.
Why don't you have some wine?
Most people know that you can't drink sea water.
"After an absence of seven years, I went home."
Tom sighed.
The waiting room is empty.
We act without fear or favor.
Did you like Boston?
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
"As he gets older, he's getting more and more stubborn."
Slavery has been abolished in most parts of the world.
You must be back by 10 o'clock.
I've lost interest in it.
Choose three books at random.
I'm suffering from a bad cold.
This area is known for its beautiful scenery.
The train is due to arrive at noon.
Thank you for your help.
Please let me know when you are ready to order.
Please have someone else do that.
Have you ever been kicked out of a bar?
I can't help but think you're making a mistake.
Are you carrying a lot of money?
Christmas is a good time to market new toys.
This room gets a lot of sunshine.
He broke his new smartphone.
The man died in a car accident.
This curry is very hot.
I didn't tell Tom what I have to buy.
That's a very good idea.
"Let's get down to business, shall we?"
I collected stamps.
The bus leaves every fifteen minutes.
I'm not afraid of mice.
We have to live with the consequences of our choices.
I have a date tonight with an old girlfriend.
This meal is adequate for three.
We're eating dinner now.
I stayed home because I had a bad cold.
That's the most important part.
Can you please stop being late all the time?
You have to keep moving or you'll fall asleep.
My room has two windows.
They moved in just the other day.
I don't think that there is any better way to learn English than by living in America.
I didn't know what to say to him.
Can you drive a manual transmission?
"It's been a week, but I'm still suffering from jet lag."
I'm interested in Japanese history.
It's time you stopped watching television.
"He was an excellent scientist, and what is more, was a great poet."
I'll take my coffee black.
Can I borrow your pen?
"Killing your spouse is one way to end a marriage. However, it's frowned upon."
I know Tom likes Mary.
She wants to kiss him.
She's not as beautiful as her mother.
"Hurry up, or you will be late."
I can't afford to wait around.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
I'll be happy to answer your question.
She bought a toy for the kid.
Few people live to be a hundred years old.
Tom said that he didn't like my dress.
I usually have a light breakfast.
Please enter your password.
I rarely drink coffee.
He finally made money.
Tom is a cheapskate.
He likes to read newspapers.
The shell of an egg is easily broken.
This is it.
I feel like taking a day off tomorrow.
Tom can speak French.
My brother is two years older than I am.
"I was surprised, too."
I know that Tom isn't as tall as Mary is.
Come in here a minute.
"Are you okay? ""Yes."""
Tom worked all day yesterday.
She is quite at home in English.
What a clever dog!
Where can we put our bags?
I wanted to eat cake.
Did you see yesterday's fireworks?
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
We invited him to our house.
Tom got arrested Monday morning.
My brother is in Australia now.
Talking in the library is not allowed.
I know that she is Spanish.
Japan is an industrial nation.
I usually get sleepy in the afternoon.
Have you finished reading the novel?
How about a second helping?
Don't get mixed up with those people.
He is very careful.
Where is the ticket counter?
This room doesn't get a lot of sun.
Water was dripping from the tap.
There comes the bus.
This hat is too small. Please show me another one.
My uncle lived abroad for many years.
She has a hot temper.
There are always lots of cars on this road.
This money is for a rainy day.
Customers stopped coming to our shop.
What time did you come home?
Both countries are now at peace.
The homework is due next Monday.
"First think, and then speak."
Please make yourself comfortable.
What's the difference between a religion and a cult?
Tom bought Mary a pearl necklace.
That test was difficult.
I hold a lot of land.
I'll tell Tom what a tremendous job you did.
Is there anything else you want me to do?
Where did Tom go last summer?
"She still hated him, even after he died."
Please deliver this to Tom in person.
I used my imagination.
It rained hard last night.
I called the police immediately.
What would you like?
Are you looking at me?
You cannot be too careful when you choose your job.
Tom is never wrong.
Is it snowing now?
My teacher told me that I should've spent more time preparing my presentation.
"A beautiful sunset, isn't it?"
That's clear.
Is everything ready now?
It tastes like chicken.
I think that Tom can handle it.
I come here every Fourth of July.
Let's take a rest in the shade.
That's why we got divorced.
I'm glad to see you.

Buy some tofu on your way home.
"You're still mad, aren't you?"
We all wish for permanent world peace.
Tom and Mary are a nice couple.
Do you want to eat some ice cream?
It was very kind of you to lend me an umbrella.
It's a very sad tale.
Computers are very useful.
What did you have for lunch yesterday?
Who painted that picture?
He was heartbroken.
There are only just a few passengers on that train.
Are you two traveling together?
Yes. You're absolutely right.
Is there something you want to ask me?
The airplane landed on my father's farm.
Monday comes after Sunday.
"You can swim, can't you?"
I won't come home.
May I sit here?
We saw a dim light in the distance.
Two boys came running out of the room.
My family is not very large.
"In a democracy, all citizens have equal rights."
He hasn't written to them in a long time.
I made it myself.
I think I have chickenpox.
What do you do when you're bored?
"You can go or stay, as you wish."
The company has changed hands three times.
The island was enveloped in a thick fog.
Do you really think I look like Tom?
Can you speak a little slower please?
The buzzer sounded.
I wonder if it's going to rain tomorrow.
Beware of pickpockets.
I hope your dream comes true.
I have no ear for music.
Didn't you know that Tom is from Australia?
I asked the doctor some questions.
Who is their homeroom teacher?
I can't make it this time.
I always brush my coat when I come home.
Write your name on this piece of paper.
"I speak French, too."
Tom gave a speech.
The black one is mine.
Tom lives from hand to mouth.
I'm not going unless Tom goes.
My stomach's full.
"Were you there, too?"
Tom gave water to his dog.
Please stand up.
He attempted to escape.
We lost by two points.
You should've asked me before doing that.
"No, you're wrong."
My efforts produced no results.
"When they heard the story, they burst into laughter."
I was no match for Tom.
"She's smarter than Mary, but not as beautiful as Mary."
Tom took Mary home.
I'm certain.
We don't like violence.
Is it safe to drink that much?
We'd like separate checks.
Is everybody here?
I've decided not to go to college.
Let's get together again tomorrow evening.
What makes you think that Tom likes heavy metal?
Tom bought some food.
She's been wearing the same hat for a month.
Can you prove it?
I must buy a new suit for my son.
Some people blame poverty for crime.
I assume this is what you're looking for.
This ticket is non-refundable.
I don't really like the stores there.
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam.
My husband and I became friends at a dinner party.
He lived abroad for many years.
How do you think I can convince her to spend more time with me?
There are a number of nice restaurants near here.
Why don't you want to go with us?
Answering that question was difficult.
I take a bath almost every day.
I'm glad that the matter was settled amicably.
She reserved a room.
I can't answer your question.
We communicate with one another by means of language.
I'm staying at a hotel for the time being.
I'm not afraid any more.
I don't believe this.
Do you have a history of ear infections?
Thanks for your support.
I have to withdraw some cash from the bank.
I'll make you breakfast.
Have you been listening?
I think that we could be good friends.
I think Tom remembered me.
My orders are absolute.
Tom is not my son.
Can I try on this jacket?
We didn't order that.
Where's the milk?
It might rain. We should take an umbrella.
"I got fired from the company, but since I have a little money saved up, for the time being, I won't have trouble with living expenses."
I'm doing my homework.
He was so mad that he forgot to eat dinner.
No more can be said.
"Are you hungry? ""I'm always hungry."""
I'm on the phone.
These grapes taste sour.
"You never listen, no matter how many times I tell you."
Those guys came last week.
The room is full of trash.
Tell me your name.
No one else came to the meeting.
I'll do it at all costs.
Tom didn't say anything about himself.
Tom usually sits in the back of the classroom.
That happened long ago.
Bears hibernate during the winter.
Tom has finally stopped crying.
Tom isn't busy today.
This drug only works for men.
Do you have a camera?
This pond is full of carp swimming around.
Can I eat this hamburger?
She was married to a rich man.
I am short of money.
It'll all be over in a few days.
I'm so happy you like Tom.
I've never flown in an airplane.
He is a biologist.
Spring is the season I like the best.
Tom is intent on doing that.
Will you marry me?
The problem is how to raise the funds.
My mother and father have a big farm there.
She has abundant hair.
"What day of the week is it? ""It's Wednesday."""
My heart started beating faster.
You should take an umbrella with you this morning.
She is smarter than he is.
"When the bomb exploded, I happened to be there."
I feel like I've heard that somewhere before.
You've turned up at the right moment.
Could you please pull the weeds and water the flowers?
Please fetch me a chair from the next room.
She got permission to use the car.
That's very helpful.
I would like to help you.
Tom tried to stop it.
He lives above me.
I'm free after lunch.
She is a teacher.
Tom was entranced by Mary's singing.
The players were in high spirits after the game.
Go see Tom.
"You have no idea who I am, do you?"
How far is it from here to the station?
It won't snow.
Put the money in the bank.
Please see to it that the child does not go near the pond.
I didn't know you were a poet.
I'm hungry.
"Tom called Mary to apologize to her, but she hung up on him."
He anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
School is over now.
"Aw man, that's terrible!"
The game has been indefinitely postponed.
My computer is slow.
Are you full?
I met a friend.
This time tomorrow I'll be studying in the library.
I can't remember why I did that.
Tom caught a large fish.
"In my dream, I was a butterfly."
"There are no bad dogs, only bad owners."
What's your favorite quote?
I want to go to Australia again before my passport expires.
The jury has returned a verdict of guilty.
We talked.
I am not certain about that.
We may have missed the bus.
Your pajamas really look nice on you.
There's a bus stop close to our school.
A good idea occurred to me.
The dictionary on the desk is mine.
He is a hard worker.
Don't wake him up.
Tom painted the window frames yellow.
"It's getting late, so I'm going home."
Tom wept.
"In my dreams, I can fly."
This room heats easily.
Could you please explain it once more?
Tom often plays solitaire.
Is Tom looking for a new job?
Did you miss me?
"I've looked everywhere, but can't find it."
Were Tom and Mary both late for class?
The concert was a success.
Friendship is as precious as anything else.
We have to change our plan.
The game lacked excitement.
We have a wide choice of books.
I don't think it's always right for local governments to submit to the central government.
She's neither rich nor famous.
This medicine only works for men.
Have you ever had cheese with apple pie?
This problem isn't easy to solve.
How much is the cheese?
"Seen from a distance, that rock looks like a human face."
A hungry man is an angry man.
He put milk in his coffee.
Our team lost all of its games.
No one could answer Tom's question.
Cats can see things even when it's dark.
There were handwritten notes on the door.
I'm a very careful person.
It's big.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
Very young children don't know many words.
Hold it.
Are you two still dating?
"Tom asked Mary a few questions that she couldn't answer, but she was able to answer most of his questions."
Have you decided what to do yet?
Pufferfish is considered a delicacy in Japan.
"My mother has a driver's license, but she doesn't drive a car."
Can you tell wolves from dogs?
I told you that I hated that shirt.
Peace talks will begin next week.
Could I sit on the aisle?
Was there someone in the room?
What's in this box?
You have a wonderful voice.

I have to get my teeth fixed.
He opened the door.
It looks like it's going to rain.
I'll go to the embassy tomorrow.
Don't forget to fasten your seatbelts.

Hide behind the door.

We're finally free.
Would you like to be tested for HIV?
No problem. I can sleep on the couch.

My children really like animals.
The sun came out.
I got something in my eye.
It rained for several days on end.
A revolt broke out.
Peace has returned after three years of war.
It's so bright.
That program is still far from perfect.
How about going to the movies on Saturday?
His face is known to many people.
"I caught a bad cold. ""That's too bad."""
How's your mother?
What has happened to Tom?
The snow was knee deep.
Wait somewhere else.
Are you taking any medicine regularly?
I'll love you for the rest of my days.
"If you're going to pull weeds, pull them out by the roots."
I won't divorce you unless you give me a good reason.
"I can read German, but I can't speak it."
You can sit anywhere you like.
I'd like to eat something.
This is the biggest car in the world.
I don't remember seeing Tom.
"From what I've seen of the product so far, it's pretty good."
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
"That was Tom's idea, not mine. Don't blame me."
You flatter me.
I'd like to interview Tom.
I'm sorry that I have kept you waiting so long.
The sun sank below the horizon and it got dark.
He's more than likely to come.
"In case of fire, I'd grab my flute and escape."
He's a man of noble birth.
I hope this is helpful.
Please be sure to close the windows before you go out.
Tom hung up the phone.
When did you become a Boy Scout?
This isn't Tom's car.
I don't like French.
I hope you can do something to help me out.
"Speak up, please."
What's your last name?
There is not one person who is in agreement with the plan.
Your car handles easily.
The dog seems to have been sick.
Wait a little longer.
It was embarrassing.
Do you still have that book?
I am not what I was ten years ago.
The sun emerged from behind the clouds.
Tom and Mary are playing chess.
There's mold on the bread. This means that we can't eat it anymore.
Is his name really Tom?
I am taking a couple of days off.
I found that book interesting.
Tom became very talkative.
Tom read Mary a story.
Urgent business prevented him from coming.
Why did you make such a mistake?
The address you're looking for is very near the city hall.
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
I have breakfast at seven every morning.
I couldn't understand why Tom wanted to quit school.
I expect to sing better next time.
Mary is tall.
I guess we're out of luck.
I have a day off tomorrow.
I always wake up in a good mood.
Please see that the birds in the cage get water and food every day.
You are rich.
I left the keys with my wallet.
Is it OK if I go outside and play?
Do you need a car?
Tom is dating a Chinese exchange student.
Don't raise my hopes like that.
"Can I use your car? ""Sure. Go ahead."""
That's totally normal.
Tell me how to do that.
Tom cried.
I'll be here if you need me.
The station is dead ahead.
We kept quiet in the room.
Did I hurt his feelings?
I wonder how many people born in the 19th century are still alive.
This is the car I spoke of the other day.
How can you stand all these noises?
I can't find my keys.
Tom drinks two or three cups of coffee every day.
His parents approve of the engagement.
Make sure to turn off the TV.
Disease and famine go together.
Tom is wearing a surgical mask.
Tom wasn't wearing socks.
Someone stole my wallet.
A great many houses were damaged in the earthquake.
She has a picture.
Did you watch the game?
He is busy preparing for the examination.
Do you see something?
"Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it."
Tom isn't as intelligent as you.
Kenya used to be a British colony.
"In Japan, a census is taken every five years."
I like mathematics.
I don't want my picture taken.
The box was too heavy.
Disneyland was very interesting. You should've come with us.

I will gladly help you.
"One more bottle of wine, please."
Draw a circle on the floor.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
What would you like to drink?
Who do you want to talk to?
My mother gave me a pearl necklace.
Get out of the water. Your lips are blue.
At least give me a hint.
I like to read books.
The leaves are turning red.
Tom is now living in Boston.
"You like older women, don't you?"
Could you please close the door?
He's very calm.
It's been three months since I met her.
Is there going to be a party tonight?
Tom kept taking pictures.
What Tom said hurt Mary's feelings.
Ready! Get set! Go!
That will suffice for now.
Come anytime you like.
It was dark.
It is the role of a student to study.
Come home at six.
An elephant has a long nose.
What's your friend's name?
I couldn't find Tom.
He's three years older than her.
I don't think that Tom knows Mary is in the hospital.
You may enter with your shoes on.
His comments about the book were favorable.
Do you have a library card?
Tom doesn't like summer. He says it's too hot.
How did your speech go?
You had better read a lot of books while you are young.
It's too difficult for me.
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
"No matter how hard you try, you can't finish it in a day."
"For me, skiing is a lot more fun than skating."
Let me hear your frank opinion.
Do your own work.
"Because he's sick, he can't come."
He can't have said such a stupid thing.
I was in bed with the flu.
"Were Tom and Mary speaking French, or were they speaking English?"
Life is like a game of chess.
You can wait over there.
Let's assume it's true.
These bags are too heavy. There's no way I can carry them all the way to the bus stop.
It isn't really visible to the naked eye.
I love Italian food.
You have to have an operation.
A high school student made this robot.
That's a mouse.
I feel happiest when I'm at school.
He worked very hard.
I need to find a place to live.
The ball is in your court.
She is a fox.
Do you see any policeman over there?
I haven't seen you in ages.
He put up a flag.
How long have you been dating?
It is unlike him to be late.
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He is making preparations for a trip.
I'm sorry I lied.
"As soon as I sat down, I fell asleep."
He is working hard to pass the examination.
My teacher told me to read as much as I could.
Wait a bit longer.
"I used to go fishing quite often, but now I rarely go."

The whole world hungers for peace.
I'm sorry for what I said. I was out of line.
There's no need to speak so loud.
"The food was cheap, but inedible."
May I borrow your bicycle?
My left hand is numb.
"When you finish reading that book, put it back where you found it."
I have to sell it today.
I am tall.
What time will dinner be served?
Pray for me.
I think that Tom has made a mistake.
Someone's at the door.
"We could all see it coming, couldn't we?"
We're not amused.
"Let's go, he said to me."
"Will you go? ""I will if I have to."""
He has a smooth tongue.
My brother-in-law is older than me.
He often breaks into the middle of a conversation.
It was so noisy that I couldn't make myself heard.
He blames his failure on bad luck.
This verb can be transitive or intransitive.
There are many people in the world who complain that they are too busy to read.
Let's take turns rowing the boat.
I promise I'll do that today.
Tom wouldn't say no.
Were you up all night?
I'm biased.
Would you like to go for a walk with me?
"That person over there is a Japanese teacher, I think."
Leave a space between the lines.
He has not come yet. Something may have happened to him.
I'm a stuntman.
She's fixing the machine.
"In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time."
Do you understand English?
I shook my head a few times.
He admitted his defeat.
We have experienced many changes over the last decade.
Little does he realize how important this meeting is.
Are you closer to your mother or to your father?
Nobody wants to talk about that.
This book is very thick.
"My name's Tom, too."
Tom has a good idea.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
The faucet is leaking.
Nobody knows why.
Please tell me about you and your family.
I arrived later than usual.
All the babies are crying.
What's that funny smell?
Handle with care.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
Do you feel any pain in your stomach?
I want to go with you.
Thank you for inviting me to your birthday party.
Tom gave a French-English dictionary to Mary.
He is concerned about his father's illness.
"If Tom comes to see me, tell him I'm not at home."
I'm truly impressed with you.
This store has a lot of postcards.
Tom wanted a higher salary.
My parents have made me what I am today.
Why didn't you come?
"She was a tall, slender blonde."
Can you come a bit earlier tomorrow?
All is fair in love and war.
What's this island's population?
Why don't you stop by for a little while?
Never forget to put out the fire.

We've really got to step on it.
We learned that the moon goes around the earth.
He made his parents happy.
"Back when there were still hundred yen bills, the American dollar was worth 360 yen."
He plays golf two or three times a month.
We are faced with a host of problems.
Don't fail to lock the door.
We were there for three hours.
I rejected the offer.
Don't eat hard foods.
Please pay at the register.
Tom is on the roof.
I must admit it was my fault.
See you again.
She turned down my request.
He came to ask us for our help.
I will endorse it.
I woke up one morning to find that all the bills in my wallet had turned into two-thousand yen bills.
Tom seldom asks questions.
Be punctual.
I know that this is none of my business.
Kids don't really like eating beans.
I need a cab.
Do you have a favorite song?
He played the piano and she sang.
This tie matches your suit.
I sleep six hours a day on average.
It's not something that adults drink.
I don't like small dogs.
"As soon as I left home, it began to rain."
Get down from your horse.
Aren't you thirsty?
How much do you love me?
Someone stepped on my foot.
Tom didn't take off his shoes.
"Hi, my name's Tom. What's yours?"
She is a fox.
I discover something new every time I read this book.
I was starting to get irritated.
I haven't eaten anything for the past three days.
I want to drink milk.
He was waiting for a long time.
Which road goes to city hall?
I think you should go to the hospital.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
Who ate all the oranges?
Could we have a spoon?
Lots of people have tried.
I'll help you if possible.
Tom has a very demanding job.
The three people gave three different accounts of the accident.
Older people still remember the Kennedy assassination.
She used to wash her hair before going to school.
Come along with me.
Please promise that you'll never do that again.
We have very strict rules here.
Don't sleep with the windows open.
Mary isn't really sick. She's only pretending to be sick.
Tom knows how to make Mary happy.
She seems to have been ill.
"It was a lie, of course."
I came here with Tom.
The sun is coming up.
This bread is freshly baked.
We agreed to his suggestions.
"The primates include not only the apes, but also man."
What's the difference between a stream and a river?
This TV is big and expensive.
Are you a morning person?
My father converted the garage into a study.
He's a miser.
Tom crossed the river in a rowboat.
Does it hurt a lot?
I asked for their approval.
We all want to be happy.
There are many children in the park.
That book is small.
They bought a box of cookies.
Why don't you go back home?
I dislike all of them.
I've lied to Tom.
She regarded me suspiciously.
I'm sorry about last night.
"This morning, we harvested peppers, tomatoes and cabbage."
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again."
He asked me if I had slept well the night before.
Excuse me?
I have no appetite.
My uncle died of cancer.
We have to buy them from abroad.
That's good.
Tom kept my lighter.
"The great Roman hero, Julius Caesar, was assassinated."
He hurt his knee when he fell.
It doesn't hurt.
I don't know his name.
It's about time to go to school.
I am happy to have so many good friends.
My father went to buy postcards.
Her attitude disgusts me.
This cloth is superior to that.
Did he go to see Mary?
I'm sure I'll be able to find it.
I like you a whole lot.
How come you didn't tell Tom about me?
No woman could measure up to his standard.
This is a life-sized statue.
I forgot to turn on the washing machine.
One of my suitcases is missing.
She might come.
I can't allow this.
She speaks English as if she were a native speaker.
"If anything should ever happen to me, you can look here."
Tom finally gave up smoking.
This box contains apples.
What should we do with people who are very sick or hurt and can't get better?
I've been to the station.
I think that he is honest.
There is a dragonfly on the ceiling.
He looked like a rich man.
I've been playing American football since I was 13 years old.
You can sleep late tomorrow morning.
There was nothing to lose.
I met him then for the first time.
There are many benefits.
How did you guys meet?
I sometimes feel drowsy in the early afternoon.
Tom didn't know where he belonged.
"I think Tom enjoys studying French, but I'm not sure."
He's very calm.
A 5% consumption tax is levied on most goods and services in Japan.
How can you be so calm?
She has been to Paris.
I will do my best.
She acted as a guide.
I have no idea of what it is like.
Hop in.
I hate Tom's cat.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
My teacher told me to read as much as I could.
I'm thirty.
Tom is out now.
Do you have a temperature?
I wish he were here now.
Tom probably isn't at home right now.
She grew up to be a great scientist.
Tom wishes that he didn't have to help with the housework.
I don't think that I can eat all this.
Thank you for preparing meals for me while I was sick in bed.
Tom called a cab for me.
I'm very sorry that I came home so late.
"I didn't know the way, so I looked at a map."
His memory amazes me.
She took a walk before breakfast.
Tom almost never asks questions.
He called me a coward.
Was it a joke?
She went to the hairdresser's.
I have a lot of work to do.
You should be careful not to eat too much.
I lost my temper and kicked the vending machine.
I first met him three years ago.
What were you doing at that time?
Have you already made a decision?
I won't cry.
I'll tell you when we get there.
Tom has lived in Australia since 2013.
We ordered too much food.
I couldn't lie to you.
Maybe it's not a good idea.
I love you and I'll always love you.
I sat waiting on the bench.
Did you get coffee?
What time did you go to sleep yesterday?
There are usually taxis in front of the train station.
"Everyone, let's stay calm."
I have two cats. One is white and the other is black.
My teacher wrote a recommendation for me.
He continued doing it.
He's eating an apple.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Last night I had a strange dream.
I have a lot of things that I must deal with.
He hasn't returned yet.
"Now that you have finished your work, you are free to go home."
I'm a little tired.
Some people are reading magazines on the train.
We got an interesting piece of information.
Where have you been?
Would you play with me?
Let's wait till he comes back.
Wet clothes stick to your skin.
Can you catch a fish with your bare hands?
Are these your friends?
The leaves will turn red in two or three weeks.
Tom thought no one was looking.
Will you take this bag while I consult the map?
At first I thought it was a prank.
Tom shouldn't say such rude things to Mary.
Are you at work?
Are you doing that on purpose?
Did you hear my son play the violin?
Are you going to call the police?
I thought that that would be a great idea.
The lion struggled to get out of his cage.
The examinations will begin on Monday next week.
Both Tom and Mary hated school.
We must finish everything before Monday morning.
Are you open on Saturday?
We'll never forget your kindness.
Would you take part in the project?
What did you buy at the supermarket?
Please keep us in the loop.
I wish it would stop raining.
I will be at your house at eight.
Have you heard Tom speak French?
I detest Tom.
The ice was thick enough to walk on.
I sat down next to him.
Did you take your medicine?
We're not as young as we used to be.
The mayor denied having taken a bribe.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Are you interested in foreign languages?
"Tom isn't at home today, is he?"
The car I rented from you has a problem.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
I'm excited about going to Australia.
I can see the tower from where I stand.
You sound just like your mother.
Why do dogs eat grass?
Don't cut this tree down.
"This time, it's different."
She thought that I was a doctor.
My sister can play the piano better than I can.
I'm a perfectionist.
She broke into tears.
I love to jog more than anything else in the world.
Is there enough food for everyone?
He looked through a magazine.
Tom doesn't think he snores.
I won't have a chance to do that.
How do you open this?
We helped him financially.
It's hard to get this camera to focus.
My grandmother paid my way to Boston.
How many years have you been playing golf?
I can't get the lid off.
I found it difficult to walk in the deep snow.
We talked about yesterday's test.
I know why you're here.
The glass is full of water.
Stay away.
It's your move.
"Tom is diplomatic, isn't he?"
I washed the dishes after supper.
I'm afraid of my wife.
Please eat only soft foods.
We must obey the traffic regulations.
May fifth is Children's Day.
I've heard this song somewhere before.
Water expands with heat.
I want to travel to Australia.
I'd like to be a dentist in the future.
Where can you buy buttermilk in Boston?
I'll be there right away.
Let's eat while the food is warm.
What'll you do after graduation?
I like taking walks in the woods.
What time is dinner served?
I hope you had a good birthday.
There is no rule without exceptions.
Let's bake cookies.
Tom immediately called an ambulance.
Will he get well?
I'd like to go to the zoo.
What secret is Tom hiding?
We'd like to speak with Tom.
He's interested in many things.
I traveled to Australia last summer.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
My sister takes piano lessons twice a week.
I have a lot of friends to help me.
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
I'll call you back later.
He acted as chairman.
He is eager for a chance to study abroad.
Tom doesn't know anything about this.
I work as a carpenter in a furniture factory.
"If it rains tomorrow, I won't go."
She hit him again and again.
I have no hesitation in telling the truth.
Are you really interested?
I knew I was going to win.
Are you planning to do that by yourself?
Don't get involved with that guy.
He became rich.
My parents aren't home a lot.
Tom spoke.
Were you in Boston for a long time?
Today is not so cold.
I'm just glad you're safe.
My hat blew off.
The apartment building is on fire.
It's been three years since Tom and Mary got married.
Tom was not able to quit smoking.
He is still dependent on his parents.
He was brave in the face of danger.
Does anyone have a flashlight?
The competition has become fierce.
Does he speak English?
Such a plan can hardly succeed.
I was at the movie theater.
When was the castle built?
"Come here, please."
The view from this room is wonderful.
"Both of you are Canadians, aren't you?"
I got bored.
Try adding a little cinnamon to your coffee.
Is there a cash machine around here?
It's hard to say.
He ran up the stairs.
What are you looking at?
Have you seen any good movies lately?
I talked with her for an hour.
Today was an awful day.
He hung up on me.
You may as well not do it at all than do it imperfectly.
He has a good chance of getting elected.
I grew up in Boston.
Fantastic!
The baby is crying.
We'll buy a new car next week.
I'm as tall as Tom.
They must've had an accident.
My cat and dog get along.
Come along with me.
"Tom is from Australia, isn't he?"
Where's the changing room?
It's just after midnight in Boston.
I suddenly felt so lonely.
What makes you think Tom likes heavy metal?
They got thoroughly wet in the rain.
I want to learn how to draw.
"She is quite pretty, but looks unhealthy."
How do you like living on your own?
When does it begin?
The old man loaded his mule with bags full of sand.
Tom swims.
He's getting ready for his trip.
I want to see the movie again.
The apple was cut in two by her with a knife.
This desk is used by Tom.
Come at ten o'clock sharp.
What did you have for breakfast?
The only thing that Tom knows how to cook is scrambled eggs.
Don't spend your money on stupid things.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I told her once and for all that I wouldn't go shopping with her.
Tom is thirty.
Everybody in this world has to cope with a lot of difficulties.
What's the matter?
"A little louder, please."
I'm a professor.
Take it easy!
Don't overdo it.
May I ask your name?
There was a pretty girl with black hair in the park.
Lawyers make a lot of money.
We can hear the ocean from here.
The sky is full of stars.
Let me think.
Tom still looks young.
You've got to get a steady job.
Let's begin.
Do you know what time it is?
We took a ferry from the island to the mainland.
How did you go home?
Tom is coming next week.
Tom is often absent from school.
Could you give me a lift to the train station?
It's up to you.
He cleared out his desk.
Tom is a car salesman.
"Wow, this brings back memories. This is a picture of when I was five years old."
I won't say yes.
Let's go through the cemetery. It's closer that way.
Are you kidding?
I had my car stolen last night.
"Bartender, I'd like to have a drink."
Is there any salt left?
We consumers must buy more domestic products.
I can see the tower from here.
What does that word mean?
Second semester has ended.
That's right.
She is contemplating visiting Europe this summer.
I wonder what Tom is laughing about.
Tom slowly sat up.
She works hard.
She was in agony.
"At first, I didn't like it, but it gradually became fun."
Is Tom going to dump Mary?
That word describes it perfectly.
Those books look as if they're going to topple over any minute.
Get off my back.
Tom is the head chef at a restaurant in Boston.
Boston is a great town.
Whose bike is it?
You have nice legs.
My mother scolded me.
There are a lot of trees around the pond.
Ants can lift things that are more than 50 times their own weight.
He always sings while taking a shower.
"Clearly, the rumor isn't true."
I didn't know about it until I read the paper.
Where did you buy those tickets?
Tom applied for a job as a French teacher.
He's my older brother.
I completely disagree with this.
I travel a lot.
He made an apology.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Tom filled the bathtub with warm water.
Don't worry about it.
The clouds are getting darker and darker and it's beginning to look like it might rain.
Tom accepted the job without hesitation.
Drop your guns!
He hurried to the station so he wouldn't miss the train.
There's no end in sight.
You put too much stuff in your wallet.
Just do this for me.
It's an unusual name.
Good job!
Watch your language.
Have you already eaten supper?
The calf was born this morning.
I'll come back tomorrow if I can.
What do you think of the new teacher?
Tom has come.
"In general, consumers prefer quantity to quality."
You find it in any dictionary.
The trouble is that I have no money on me now.
"Windy this morning, isn't it?"
What's the meaning of this word?
Is that my toothbrush?
French is the only language I know.
Never tell a lie.
Will you let me see you again?
She made a new suit for him.
What did you do with those books?
I had my wallet stolen on the bus.
May I have a bus schedule?
The cat slowly approached the mouse.
Can you validate this parking ticket?
I'm not interested in material gain.
You mean you didn't tell him anything?
"To tell the truth, I have no money with me."
What's your name?
They made fun of Mary.
I hear you've got a new girlfriend.
Tom wanted to buy a new smartphone.
What sort of coats are in fashion this year?
"Hurry up, or you'll miss the train."
Tom stopped.
Ski jumping looks scary.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I was fined six thousand yen for a parking violation.
Can't you help me just a little bit?
Russia is a very big country.
I said drop it!
"When I was a child, my mother made me eat green vegetables every day."
I've lost my pencil.
I had a ball.
It was a beautiful day for a walk.
Tom isn't a chef.
Let's drink our coffee first.
The boy playing the guitar is my brother.
She's a wonderful wife and mother.
I have met him many times.
"Oh, no! We're running out of gas."
We shouldn't look down on poor people.
Who ate all the cheese?
Today I have a lot of things to do.
How long have they been here?
What do you think of this plan?
Tom and Mary look exhausted.
You'd better stop smoking.
Tom doesn't like working alone.
We have walked all around the lake.
An old friend came to my house for a visit.
You'll feel better after a night's sleep.
Have you made progress in your studies?
I'd like to get you something for your birthday.
The curtain rises at 7 p.m.
I didn't feel like scolding her for being late.
You can't fight city hall.
I hear she is going to get married next month.
Tom realized that the door was unlocked.
Stop saying that!
You're supposed to be back by noon.
I've decided to do that this morning.
Would you mind shutting the door?
May I help you?
Tom might be right.
I got these tickets to the concert for free.
How can I lose weight?
"Just water, please."
Both of them can speak French.
"I'd like to buy two 45-cent stamps, please."
She left her umbrella in the train.
"If it snows, I won't go out."
Let's go back to our places.
I'm not really hungry.
She assisted her brother with his homework.
There is a park near my house.
"When I got to school, the race had already finished."
She hit him again and again.
I must go right away.
Where did Tom get that much money?
I'm angry with you.
Don't let the cat out of the bag.
"You think I did it, don't you?"
What is your name?
Is it safe to swim in this river?
It's raining again.
You can keep this one for yourself.
I had my ears checked.
Tom never asked why.
I have lived here a long time.
Nothing is so appealing as the innocent face of a sleeping baby.
Are you seriously thinking about getting involved?
It's been snowing all night.
Why didn't you introduce us?
When will you finish your work?
Let's play cards instead of watching television.
Could I have some more coffee?
Who stole the apple?
He banged the door in anger.
We'd like a double room with bath.
An Englishman would not pronounce it like that.
I have an older brother and two younger sisters.
Is breakfast included?
It was hot yesterday.
"Can you help me find my mom and dad, please?"
"I'd like to tell you, but I can't."
Can you tie a tie?
He is hard to get along with.
I usually wear jeans.
I nearly blacked out.
Tom is scared of water and doesn't like to swim.
It's based on a true story.
I want to drink coconut milk.
Will you explain the rule to me?
"If you're sleepy, you should sleep."
I don't think Tom knows that we're here.
I turned on the lights.
The poor old woman was robbed of her money.
There were a lot of people in the park.
I'm thirsty.
I thought that you didn't know that.
Are you sure Tom won't remember anything?
See if my answer is correct.
Bring me the money.
Who do you think was watching TV in this room last night?
Most students like sports.
The dog bit my hand.
Are you really interested in that?
There's so much to do.
It was really noisy in the room so Tom covered his ears.
Do you know who Tom's girlfriend is?
Tom and Mary are good singers.
The coup attempt was foiled at the last moment.
Listen to me.
They weren't invited.
Please don't leave.
I'm always leaving my umbrella on the train.
That theory isn't generally accepted.
A lot of people came to the party.
I don't want to lead a dog's life anymore.
What kind of play is it?
It's not very nice.
Tom lives in a large house.
I guess it was just a lucky guess.
There are only two weeks left until Christmas.
Please just leave me alone.
You can make yourself heard even from here.
I have no idea why he quit his job suddenly.
Tom has no regrets.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
I usually get up at eight.
It's common sense.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
You may as well come with me.
There's hardly any wind today.
This year there were few rainy days in August.
I gave in to temptation and began to smoke a cigarette.
Wait for us here.
Water has no calories.
"Mangos are sweet, they smell good, and they're delicious."
I tried to change the subject.
I won't forget what happened last summer.
All of us love you.
I'd like you to translate this document into French.
"Without your encouragement, I would've given up this plan."
Do you have any objections?
Where can I buy that magazine?
There are many senior citizens in this area.
Open your book to page 30.
We celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary yesterday.
How does your opinion differ from his?
Thanks for your help.
I enjoyed swimming.
Are you sure it's safe to move this dynamite?
This isn't the first time that Tom has lied.
"Tom started to leave, but Mary stopped him."
Tom spilled the milk.
What did she do today?
It's not as cold here as I expected.
Tom likes tea better than coffee.
I decided not to go.
"Could you write that down, please?"
I don't want to go either.
Where were you today?
It's hardly raining at all.
He is no better than a beggar.
There is a cat.
The window was left open.
"Last night, he studied all night long."
Tom has three grown-up children.
He has been dead for five years.
The children watched the squirrels.
There are still many things left to do.
We're out of cheese.
The wind blew her hat off.
I called him up yesterday.
What did the doctor say?
It's still a little scary.
How often do you give blood?
"You like it, huh?"
He's dead drunk.
You should sleep.
She was jealous when he talked to another girl.
I only ate soup.
There was a large harvest of peaches this year.
He had the bad habit of drinking too much wine.
Tom didn't want to interrupt Mary while she was studying.
We have a break from 10:40 to 11:00.
This is the best book I have ever read.
This sword has a strange history.
"Wine, please."
Tom shook his head.
I just made this.
I heard the howl of a wolf.
Every now and then I like to have hot and spicy food.
Correct the errors if there are any.
Are you taking any medications?
May I ask a few more questions about that point? It's a little obscure.
We need to face reality.
You'll need to stand in line to buy those tickets.
Do you want to go somewhere else?
"From the top of that tall building, you can easily see the city."
It's summer.
You're lying.
Is there any other size?
We are all looking forward to seeing your family.
I don't know how old that bridge is.
Where did you learn French?
He became a nice young man.
Would you draw me a map?
Tom got out of the hospital three days ago.
Don't forget to buy some bread on your way home.
"He is a British citizen, but lives in India."
I'm looking forward to meeting you.
What did you study in Australia?
Might I come in?
Tom was surrounded by police officers.
We talked in sign language.
Give them three hundred dollars.
Were you here last Monday?
"I have to lose some weight, so I'm on a diet."
Tom stepped off the train.
I can't stop doing this.
"In the first place, we have to decide on the name."
Somebody is watching me.
He likes green the best.
How about some milk and cookies?
I anticipated a quiet vacation in the mountains.
Please take off your hat.
How did Tom meet Mary?
The professor encouraged me in my studies.
I'm sure it broke during shipping.
Are you still at home?
Could you please show me your passport?
That was it.
She tried to squeeze the juice from the orange.
Good books are always worth reading.
I feel great.
This is plagiarism.
Why don't you come to my house next week?
Please put it back in its place.
Do you own a house?
We went swimming in the river.
This road is closed to traffic.
Were you jealous?
"I'd like my egg very, very soft boiled."
We'll be seeing you again before long.

This song was popular in the 1970s.

Is Tom at work?
The floor is covered with a thick carpet.
The palace was heavily guarded.
Is there anything to eat?
I have lots of Canadian friends.
My bicycle was stolen.
Tom didn't mention the accident to me.
Is that today's newspaper?
I finished doing the work before supper.
Where in Turkey do you live?
We are soccer players.
This bread is moldy.
Tom didn't know what Mary wanted to eat.
She is wrong.
You should inspect the car well before you buy it.
Is that as heavy as this?
I found that there was a little girl sobbing.
Thank you for your kind assistance.
She is awkward.
Doctors should keep abreast of all the latest developments in medicine.
I think that it's true.
"The other day he said to me, ""I will lend you this book tomorrow."""

Parking here is prohibited.
Graham Greene is one of my favorite authors.

I dare say he is right.
I'm sure that I'm right.
Can it be phrased another way?
Where is the bathroom?
Can I do that later?
I want to hold your hand.
I sometimes talk to my neighbor across the fence.
I wonder if we'll win.
I thought Tom wasn't seeing anyone.
Even Tom did that.
He rolled off the bed.

The TV is broken.
I seldom read books in French.

I hate snow.
Tom has fallen for Mary's trap.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Come home before it gets dark.
Nobody knows you're here.

I wonder why he is so angry.
How was the movie?

He really wants to buy a new motorcycle.
No students were absent.
I'm sorry. I have another appointment.
I met him at the station.
Are you both crazy?
We'll fight to the last.

All the bus's windows were open.
Should this be deleted?

This is totally unacceptable.
He looks healthy.
He hung a picture on the wall.

He looked like a rich man.
I have some English books.
Tom had no choice.
Who left the door open?
He quickly scanned my manuscript.
Were the results surprising?
Did you hear about Tom's resignation?
It was quite dark when I got home last night.
I can't stand him.
Are you bringing Tom?
What's the plan for today?
I know who lives in this house.
I waited for you.
Come back in an hour.
Could you please pass me the pepper?
How cute!
"On the whole, I agree with you."
He adhered to his own theory.
I am afraid your plan will not work.
When was the last time it rained?
The car ran into a guardrail.
Now's not the time for that.
This is a great idea.
What are you doing?
Don't go anywhere near that room.
I want to get better at cooking.
I haven't had a square meal for a week.
"How many languages can you say ""Hello"" in?"
Watch out!
Many students have part-time jobs.
I'm telling you because I'm worried about you.
They have something in common with each other.
This park reminds me of my childhood.
Is this real silk?
I have to hand in my report by next Wednesday.
We have enough money.
Am I allowed to use this?
Have you ever seen a film this good?
"For further inquiries, please feel free to contact us toll-free at 0120-00-0000."
Tom is from Australia.
He's the same age as me.
He drank three bottles of beer.
Who do you think wrote that graffiti on the wall?
The number of students is dropping.
She's not a liar.
What sports do you like?
This diamond is fake.
How far is the station?
You shouldn't associate with men like that.
How old is he?
Turn the knob clockwise.
Are you ready to go out?
The origin of the universe will probably never be explained.
"If he had been there, I could have given him your message."
Who's that gentleman?
It's about thirty minutes from here on foot.
"Mary was invited, right?"
It sounds easy.
The lost boy held out until the rescue team came.
Tom lacks motivation.
I went for a walk.
He assured me of his help.
Did you know Tom was a vegetarian?
I understand how you feel.
You should've bought a pencil.
Tom rarely smiles.
Turn off the alarm.
I am the same age.
Are you going out today?
We are all looking forward to seeing you and your family.
What did you talk to Tom about?
"It was snowing, but it wasn't very cold outside."
Tom is quite pessimistic.
I don't want to buy that bag.
I received a letter from my mother yesterday.
I'm just a plain old office worker.
He does not watch TV at all.
Send me there.
They continued walking.
I know Tom is afraid.
Tom is suffering from cancer.
He couldn't fulfill a promise he had made to his father.
"I don't know, said Tom."
Do refrain in childish behaviour!
We can drive in Japan when we are eighteen years old.
She was on the verge of crying.
Are you optimistic?
Can you remember the summer Tom shaved his head?
Wait a second.
This wine is made from grapes.
"How about a cup of coffee? ""I wish I could, but I have some place I have to go."""
He came in just as I was going out.
You'd better be careful not to catch cold.
"Since it was raining, we had to eat our picnic lunch indoors."
It tastes very good.
Do you want me to help?
I like French.
Where do you usually eat lunch?
Why did Tom do that?
"It wasn't a 100 yen coin, it was a bottle cap."
You don't have to do that today.
Mary is Tom's mother-in-law.
He put on the red jacket.
Tom is over thirty.
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
Tom came on Monday and went back home the following day.
The storm prevented me from going out for a walk.
When does the movie start?
A green light is on.
I hope you will call again.
He told me that his father was a teacher.
I don't feel anything.
My father passed away at the age of 54.
I didn't know that you were a member.
Congratulations on your victory.
How old are your children?
My grandfather died in Korea.
Neighbors help each other.
I was almost hit by a car.
I use French almost every day.
He is afraid of death.
He translated the verse into English.
It's better to chill white wine before you serve it.
I wonder if people can survive with only two hours of sleep a night?
Stand still!
I was satisfied.
That's broken.
This flashlight takes two batteries.
Why do you want to meet Tom?
The church is decorated with flowers for the wedding.
How one views something depends on one's situation.
I've decided to study abroad.
Has anyone here seen Tom?
She kicked him.
I suspect that Tom will be there tonight.
How would you like your steak done?
Sorry to trouble you.
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
"We ate ice cream, too."
We like playing in mud.
I didn't mean to give that impression.
Where should I sign?
Tom went to town by bus.
Are you seriously thinking of giving Tom your computer?
We were held up for half an hour in the traffic and so we arrived late.
Hold on just one second.
"After dinner, they enjoyed playing cards."
I'll never set foot in this house again.
Tom stayed home to take care of his mother.
Tom couldn't hide his anger.
How're you doing?
Why does Tom always wear that hat?
Why do you think that guy said that?
What were you doing then?
You should quit smoking.
I'm a twelfth grader.
Tom was unable to answer Mary's questions.
The police promised to look into the matter.
My dream is to be a firefighter.
Tom is living with his uncle now.
She gave him a lot of money.
"In this company, there are more women than men."
Stop talking about that.
My opinion is different from yours.
I sprang out of bed.
Burn this letter after you finish reading it.
I know you're rich.
I'm looking for my car keys.
I won't be able to finish if you don't help me.
I wonder whether Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
Something is wrong with this calculator.
"Nickel is a hard, silver-white metal."
His project ended in failure.
"Today, I want to run on the beach."
I usually eat breakfast here.
I see.
He contributed a lot of money.
We live in the age of technology.
Don't go back on your promise.
I lost my wallet on the way to school.
Somehow I slept all day today.
Do you have Japanese newspapers?
The ball hit the net.
Please come right now.
Just don't tell anyone what I said.
I held up my hand to stop a taxi.
I'll take any job you can offer me.
The man you see over there is my uncle.
They have run this small hotel since it was established.
The thief ran away.
This song reminds me of my childhood.
He made up his mind quickly.
The dog is white.
I can't express how happy I was at that time.
I found the room empty.
My brother is living in Boston.
How sad!
You should be more open-minded.
Tom asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.
Is this a one-way street?
Is she all right?
He has been sick for a long time.
He found a broken camera.
It looks like fun.
He will soon return home.
Destiny is sometimes cruel.
Tom left without waiting for a reply.
This chair is uncomfortable.
Want a drink?
Are you going to a movie?
We've run out of gas.
"If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner."
Tom is a wolf.
It's not far away.
I broke an ashtray.
A hyphen is needed here.
Tom will come to Boston next Monday.
The result was what I had expected.
How long does it take to get there by bus?
She got angry at his rude behavior.
We're good friends.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
Tom is too old to work.
When did you wake up?
The two went to the window to look outside.
It was a very beautiful flower.
I don't know why the meeting was postponed.
The ground is covered with snow.
"Today, a party for graduates was held."
This is the doghouse that I made myself.
Tom neither confirmed nor denied the rumors.
I'm not angry.
Recently we seem to just keep missing each other. I never seem to be able to meet up with him.
I don't want to buy it if I don't need it.
Your sweater is on backwards.
Today is election day in Poland.
Tom and Mary have three sons.
Is that from Tom?
I was too tired to walk any more.
Shut your mouth.
I didn't get the meaning.
"You may be able to pass unnoticed in a city, but in a village that's not possible."
First impressions matter.
How deep is Lake Biwa?
She was never completely free from pain after the accident.
I use Firefox.
My little brother was injured in the accident.
You should compare the two motorcycles.
There's something on your face.
I had a good sleep last night.
My baby keeps coughing and sneezing.
How did this window get broken?
Both Tom and Mary are good chess players.
What would you pay me to do that?
I like swimming.
This weighs more than the limit.
Tom took his dogs for a walk.
Tom likes music.
Let's decide together where to go first.
I'll wait till 2:30.
Don't touch my things.
It is because of his selfishness that no one wants to associate with him.
He is confined to bed now.
When is your new book going to be published?
She went on with the work.
You speak French very well. I wish I could speak it as well as you.
Anyone can manage that.
What flight were you on?
Speak more quietly.
What're you thinking about?
What does it contain?
I like French cooking.
I did not mean to disappoint her.
Did you tell the truth?
She says that she wants me to come with her.
That's my favorite French word.
World War II ended in 1945.
It's good to be back in Boston.
This bed seems sturdy.
He speaks as if he were an expert.
He's busy with job hunting.
"Everyone's doing it, so it's OK."
I thought you were my friend.
This is just my personal opinion.
We all like you a lot.
"If you need any help, let me know."
I'd bring my own food if I were you.
Can you give me your phone number?
Christmas is coming.
You're my woman.
Do you have a red pencil?
Tom would know the answer.
Give me something to write with.
Tom is probably just a year or two younger than Mary.
I borrow money.
The rich are not always happy.
Can I hug you?
Tom is a backpacker.
This is an urban legend.
Tom hurried to his room.
That medicine worked.
Did you just call me?
Tom was the one who saved Mary's life.
I prefer to travel in my car.
What is it that you want me to do now?
Are you prepared for emergencies?
Who's hiding behind the curtain?
Tom won't buy it.
My father works for a power company.
Send it by airmail.
I'm not old enough to get a driver's license.
They have been married for ten years.
I believe in magic.
She is a good tennis player.
She gets up at seven.
What's the weather like in Boston?
There's always someone talking.
Tom told Mary that he had seen John in January.
These pants don't have any pockets.
"I used to watch this anime a lot when I was a kid, but I can't quite remember what happened to the hero in the final episode."
The agreement was a product of compromise between the two governments.
She was wearing a red skirt.
I'm not in a position to answer.
The union bosses are fighting the freeze on wage hikes.
How do you say it in French?
I'll foot the bill.
"I'm really glad you're here, Tom. Thank you."
I have two children away at university.
I could've done much better.
The leader of the party is a famous scientist.
I apologized.
Is it OK if I bring a guest?
We have a parking lot for the customers.
I hope this seat isn't occupied.
"If you are here, it means you care."
The storm laid the village flat.
I'll clean up this mess myself.
He painted the ceiling blue.
It's a short walk.
What was that?
How can I turn off this light?
My hat was blown off by the wind.
You don't need to be afraid of making mistakes.
Is this jacket right for me?
I think that it's a good idea.
"Generally speaking, Americans like coffee."
My arm still hurts.
I'll see to it.
We should rest for a minute.
Wait a minute.
"Mom, when's supper?"
Your collar has a stain on it.
I waited until the last minute.
Tom is too old to make it as a pop singer.
The rain lasted for three days.
Then what?
"You're friends with Tom, aren't you? ""Yeah."" ""What's he like?"""
It's hard to distinguish you from your brother.
Is that Tom's girlfriend?
I watched TV yesterday.
He came down to breakfast.
"Turn off the light, please."
Please come and help me.
She wrote the book with very little effort.
How do you want your eggs?
Is Tom your friend?
I shouldn't have lied.
I came to Tokyo to attend a conference.
No one knows what the future holds.
Please call me at seven tomorrow morning.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
"I won't quit, no matter what you say."
This isn't the first time this has happened.
I started working.
Won't you eat lunch with me?
"You have something to say about everything, don't you?"
I hate Tom.
I'm afraid I've eaten too much.
Tom bought a new pair of skis.
It's very hot today.
A watchman sat with his legs crossed.
Tom is an illegal immigrant.
"You know that person's name, right?"
Don't eat too much.
You should make use of this chance.
Each of the three boys got a prize.
My little finger is swollen.
"He was born on July 28th, 1888."
Tom took his shirt off.
"After that, he went home."
Several children are playing on the beach.
I'm looking forward to receiving a favorable answer from you.
It's a quarter past nine.
The population of Tokyo is about five times as large as that of our city.
People say she was an actress when she was young.
Time's up.
He is a very imaginative writer.
Tom couldn't convince Mary.
I teased Tom.
Whose is that notebook?
"In the quiet room, only the sound of the old clock ticking could be heard."
I can't understand what she says.
They've already finished the work.
Friendship is more precious than anything else.
I hope my last mail didn't sound too harsh.
My grandfather planted this tree.
I don't want to eat it now.
The meat looks good.
Does anybody have a pencil?
Thank you for your consideration.
Who do you live with?
Would you carry this upstairs for me?
This dictionary is nearly useless.
I was on a business trip all last week.
"Hey, you! What are you doing?"
I've never seen him really get down to work.
How many times have you been to Australia?
"In spite of the heavy traffic, we arrived on time."
This rose is very beautiful.
There were over fifty girls at the party.
I think so.
Washing clothes by hand is difficult and time-consuming.
I have to return some books to the library.
He died in the traffic accident.
Have you been crying?
Come and see.
My parents taught me how to drive.
Tom swore that he didn't tell anyone our secret.
You are welcome to the use of our house while we are away on vacation.
"Thirty dollars is a lot for that small room, he thought."
She likes cake a whole lot.
He balanced himself on a log.
We close at 2:30.
Sing along.
This happens all the time.
Do you have any rock CDs?
Robots have taken the place of men in this factory.
"No matter what happens, I will never change my mind."
My father died before I was born.
The second showing will start soon.
Are you a college student?
"If you keep on drinking like that, you'll get sick."
I haven't been around much.
Tom filled the bathtub with hot water.
It was colder yesterday than today.
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
Who's the goalie?
I don't want to go to the party.
Money is everything.
Tom was a pretty good singer when he was younger.
I dislike living in such a noisy place.
Children often ask me for money.
Big men aren't always strong.
What for?
Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.
"To succeed in life, you need two things: ignorance and confidence."
We have a reservation.
He must be nearly forty.
He's three years older than her.
She knows me.
Do you like painting pictures?
Are you looking for us?
I have a picture of Tom in my wallet.
I've decided to visit Boston.
I exercise for an hour every day.
That's all for today.
Tom is a slow walker.
Overeating can lead to disease.
Is there a curfew?
Tom is a cranky old man.
She doesn't care how she dresses.
I want to help.
"In America, cars drive on the right side of the road."
Can you help me translate this into French?
I would never use emojis in business emails.
I want to get this luggage in the truck. Do you think you could help me?
I want to learn more about this.
The cost of living is soaring.
It's not here.
"For a business owner, having a clear overview of one's entire business is vital."
There was no one in the mine when it blew up.
It took me five hours to make this kennel.
The Nile is in Africa.
This sparrow's wings are broken.
Don't ask me so many questions. Use your head.
Is Tom still a university student?
Something's happened to Tom.
You're going to need a few stitches.
Please tell me what to do.
That car's so big that parking it is difficult.
How do you heat the house?
Today's hectic.
Tom abandoned his family.
"Despite our efforts, we failed after all."
I want to eat cake.
I arrived at the moment she was leaving.
How many English words do you know?
The kettle is boiling.
Tom was all worn out.
Everyone but Tom agreed.
Tom works on a farm not so far from here.
He was exposed to danger.
It changed in an instant.
I thought you were working.
Mary bought a present for her friend's daughter.
I hit upon a good idea then.
Why didn't you tell me you were in Boston?
I was away on vacation.
The bird is flying.
Don't give up!
"Next person, please."
I made several mistakes in the exam.
"Excuse me, how much are these?"
Don't eat all the cake. Leave some for me.
Hi! Do you work here?
He is wearing gloves.
I brought you red roses.
Tom quietly sneaked out of the room.
I can't put up with this any longer.
Tom decided not to say anything until he knew more about the situation.
Back off!
I was born in Boston.
Tom folded up his umbrella.
I go to a restaurant once in a blue moon.
I'm afraid she can't answer.
I want you to keep your promise.
She is a woman of great beauty.
About one third of the earth's surface is land.
I'm anxious to succeed.
She drives an imported car.
You've overdone it.
I wonder if Tom will be late.
You will soon be convinced I am right.
Tom shared a large number of ideas with the committee.
"Since I was tired, I went to bed early."
I believe you're right.
That newspaper has a large circulation.
We'd better not remain here.
How did you meet Tom initially?
I ate a quarter of the cake.
We have a three-day weekend next week.
Is the flower real?
We adopted a child.
Are you enjoying yourselves?
Tom can't sleep without his teddy bear.
I don't have much free time.
It'll be hard to convince Tom.
The plane took off at exactly ten o'clock.
Don't get steamed up.
Have fun.
Would you like to dance with me?
I'm telling you this because I'm worried about you.
You look tired. You ought to rest for an hour or two.
Do as you please.
May I ask your name?
"If it didn't need to be done, nobody would do this kind of thing."
It was disappointing that nobody ate the expensive sushi I had served.
It's the ski season.
There is a cat under the bed.
"No matter how much I eat, I never get fat."
I spend all day in front of the computer.
It seems that Tom was lying.
I really need to hit somebody.
Here I come.
I had my picture taken.
"These flowers aren't only beautiful, but they smell nice."
Tell me what you really think.
Please wait a minute.
Your hands are like ice.
You don't have to use such a harsh tone with me.
Will you tell me the way to the station?
I hate all of them.
I'd like to live in a decent house.
I'm still seeing Tom.
Were there any witnesses?
I'm able to swim across the river.
I know the person in the picture.
Don't play around on your way home.
"Actually, my brother is my half-brother."
The post office is just next door.
I returned home from Boston yesterday.
It's a crime the way he treats his children.
"If you press this button, the machine will start."
She got to the station at seven.
It's junk. Throw it away.
Do you remember the day when you and I first met?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
The house collapsed a week later.
I lay down to rest.
She bowed to me politely.
Someone must have left it there.
That suit has an expensive look.
I can't see anything.
There's no way that Tom knows Mary.
There isn't much butter left in the refrigerator.
You'd better avoid discussion of religion and politics.
It's blowing hard.
Tom isn't interested in me. It's you he's in love with.
"I'd like to do that, but I don't have the time."
My mother is in the hospital now.
I haven't been busy for these past two days.
Please turn on the light.
This cheese is made from goat's milk.
I figured that Tom could do that.
When do you plan to come back?
I know the person in the next room is either Tom or Mary.
I made a really big sandwich.
Tom is still underage.
May I swim in this lake?
I don't have the address now.
Please take this parcel to the post office.
I asked Tom to help me clean the pool.
Everything is OK.
Tom looked in the yellow pages to find a used car dealer.
Wait for me here. I'll be right back.
Are you afraid to go home?
Tom said that you speak French better than Mary.
Tom closed his eyes.
I plan on speaking French more in the future.
Those who violate the rules will be punished.
There is little hope of my success.
I'll do my best to be there by 2:30.
My older brother is a teacher.
A good idea came into my head.
Don't kill yourself.
Tom needs to come clean about that.
How would you like your steak cooked?
It's time to hit the sack.
Settle down!
We must try to protect the environment.
She is curious to learn new things.
There was almost nothing in the room.
Please look the other way. I want to change my clothes.
I'm headed that way right now. I'll be arriving soon.
I take full responsibility for the action.
I changed my hairstyle.
I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
Tom owns a house in Boston.
Neither of my parents is strict with me.
A good idea occurred to me at that time.
Is the phone ringing?
It isn't easy to get rid of bad habits.
Would you let me do it?
Tom and Mary got married this year in the spring.
The gasoline truck ran into the gate and blew up.
What's your occupation?
I will go on foot.
Did you know Tom then?
"How was the test? ""It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be."""
I also ate ice cream.
She was late once again.
I was as cool as a cucumber.
Where do you want to go?
Let's end this debate.
I read a book.
She sold him her car.
Most people wouldn't want to do that.
Your dreams have come true.
What a waste of water!
I went to bed a little earlier than usual.
Have you eaten your dinner already?
Check everything once more.
This painting is nicely done. It looks just like Mom.
I would rather sing than dance.
Tom left thirty minutes ago.
I'm calling from a cell phone.
"I'm sure I've met him somewhere, but I don't remember who he is."
My legs are weak.
An unforgettable event occurred.
Stop crying like a girl.
My parents are very religious people.
He goes to school on foot.
Just leave Tom alone.
Tom sat down.
I'm leaving first.
Take care.
The idea isn't bad.
This house isn't for sale.
I often talk to him on the bus.
He asked for money.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
I want to travel all over the world.
He is a man of wisdom.
We helped on the farm.
"I studied English very hard every day, but I didn't learn a lot."
When did I lie?
I want to eat something.
Is his story true?
Tom went into the room.
The peace talks failed again.
There are a lot of turtles on the beach.
He's being threatened by a certain gangster.
Zurich is the second largest gold market in the world after London.
Nobody showed up.
Tom is a lightweight.
The window is cracked.
I'm here on business.
"I don't have much money, but I'm getting by."
I want to extend my stay here for a few more days.
I decided to be a lawyer.
I saddled the horse myself.
I'm afraid that you have the wrong number.
The Giants lost the game by 20 points.
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I sleep late.
The fact was brought to light.
She also bought the dictionary.
I'm not my father.
Do I need a tie?
Please forget what we talked about earlier.
He made a great fortune in his lifetime.
Tom is eating a peach.
It would've been better if I hadn't asked.
The bus will take you to the center of the city.
I'm tied up with this job recently.
I'm sick and tired of hamburgers.
Will two cloves of garlic be enough?
He tied the dog to a tree.
My grandfather takes a walk every morning.
Is it OK if I open the curtain?
Do you believe in fate?
The bathroom is at the end of the hall.
I know Tom is scared.
That's a nice coat.
I added a room to my house.
No one knew that.
"They knew a lot of songs, too."
I have to make the best of that small room.
It is dangerous to fly in this heavy fog.
We had a difficult winter.
Industrial areas tend to be on the outskirts of cities.
Maybe I can do it next week.
I'll talk to Tom on Monday.
Reading can develop your mind.
You are my best friend.
I found out where to buy fruit cheaply.
"So, what do you suggest?"
He killed that man.
Were those men speaking in French or in English?
My apartment is near here.
It was such a powerful explosion that the roof was blown off.
I know that Tom is a university professor.
It will be spring soon.
Tom took the wrong train.
You'll be OK.
They have been busy.
I guarantee that this information is correct.
This area has changed completely.
Let's sit on the bench.
Do you drink green tea often?
I shouldn't have trusted someone like Tom.
We don't have root beer.
Go to sleep.
My grandfather likes to walk.
Tom doesn't know how long he'll have to wait for Mary.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
May I eat a little of it?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom retired when he was 65.
This is the most difficult book I have ever read.
"There are abilities that improve rapidly and those that improve slowly, aren't there?"
Can you lend me a dime?
I was bullied.
What do you plan on doing tomorrow?
Thank you for considering it.
Come with me.
Things can't be accomplished overnight.
She speaks relatively quickly.
I like tennis.
I'm waiting for the train.
I think this is too easy.
The plane flew east.
The mountain is about 3000 meters above sea level.
I was very hungry.
How old do you think Tom is?
The leaves fell.
Why are you busy today?
I wonder if it's going to rain tomorrow.
You should do that right away.
I cook Thanksgiving dinner every year.
I helped my father wash his car.
Tell me what you want me to do.
My house is big.
Surely he'll phone me tonight.
Have you experienced nausea recently?
How dare you ask me for help!
How do you do it?
That made me change my mind.
He has a good head on his shoulders.

Do you need that book?
Forget it!
He extinguished the fire.
I often ski.
There's a safe somewhere in Tom's house.
This is a newspaper.
I have to be there by 2:30.
Do you think you can handle this problem?
Who's the man playing the piano?
"This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday."
He ran away when he saw me.
I don't want to do that today.
I've run out of money.
I suddenly missed my watch.
We reached school at eight-thirty.
Tom isn't the only one who has to study. I have to study as well.
I have already finished reading this book.
Tom has broad shoulders.
It was so cold that we made a fire.
My mother bought my brother a yellow umbrella.
Tom doesn't do it much.
"As long as you are thinking about the pros and cons of a relationship, I don't think you can call it love."
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
Tom is mad.
I think Tom could do that if he tried.
That won't make any difference.
What shirt will you wear to school today?
He visited France three times.
He looks down on women.
You are overworked.
Would you care for some more cake?
I don't think you can do this.
Tom took out a magazine and began to read it.
She put her elbows on her knees.
I have many colleagues.
She is a selfish person.
He wants to live as long as he can.
You have too many likes and dislikes.
You should follow this rule.
There's something I'd like you to take a look at.
I'm not good at parallel parking.
What are Tom's true intentions?
We consoled each other.
Tom said he didn't plan on going back to Australia.
Why aren't you going to school?
He pretended not to hear me.
He has bad eyes.
When did you notice that?
"That coat may have cost a lot of money, but it's worth it."
Tom is smarter than Mary thinks.
Are you good at playing basketball?
I really like green peppers.
The boys are playing football.
Where can I buy snacks?
"Instead of just reading books all the time, go outside occasionally and get some exercise."
He is overweight.
I suspect Tom and Mary are over thirty.
Is this bike Tom's?
When was the last time your had your hair cut?
Elephants can't ride bicycles.
Please call me at my hotel later.
I'll make sure of it.
Tom thinks that Mary doesn't get enough sleep.
Have you ever been to Africa?
The drinks looked cool and delicious.
I'll never again let such a thing happen.
"Tom, I need to talk to you."
This room is too hot to study in. I can't stand it any more.
"She is rich, certainly, but I don't think she's very smart."
I wish that noise would stop. It gets on my nerves.
Tom sat down on the bench.
I ate your strawberries.
I've got to fix my hair.
I thought that it went OK.
Please come back at once.
He doesn't have a mind of his own.
I've been to Australia more times than Tom has.
Tom fell off a ladder.
Both drinking and smoking are bad for your health.
He hasn't come yet.
Not a single cloud could be seen in the sky.
Why is everyone applauding?
I don't know if she wants to go with me.
A lot still remains to be done.
Tom welcomed Mary with open arms.
"When I pressed the button, the bell rang."
He walked in front of me.
I lost my notebook today.
Will you help me look for my purse?
I was appointed chairperson.
"What's this song? I've heard it before, but I can't remember the name."
She's wearing eye shadow.
I'll forgive you just this once.
Don't worry about it!
I like Tom.
Do you want to play hide and seek?
Strawberries are in season at the moment.
I saw bear tracks in the snow.
I'll bring my sister to the party.
There is plenty of food.
My hobby is collecting old bottles.
I know Tom is your friend.
Among the guests were the mayor and his wife.
Maybe that's why Tom isn't here today.
The newspaper is by your side.
Let's try again.
We want peace in the world.
There is a little water in the glass.
I had my hair cut at the barber's.
You'll need a special tool to do it.
"Since it got warmer, I took off my sweater."
Please leave immediately.
The boy came back.
Let me speak.
She's eating fruit.
"Tom, I have something I want you to do for me."
The test was too difficult for me.
Tom speaks French fairly well.
"Excuse me, could you show me how to use the washing machine?"
I don't want anybody to know I'm here.
Graham Greene is my favorite author.
She accused me of stealing her money.
I can't drink coffee.
Hurry!
Mary really takes after her mother.
I called him.
"Fortunately, Tom didn't break anything."
Whose account should I transfer the money to?
"There's a ""Fragile"" sticker on the box."
I'm very tired.
He was too sleepy to read the evening newspaper.
Tom set a trap.
I stayed up all night.
Read the book aloud.
Tom's dad is rich.
I'm still not very good at French.
I hear that you play the piano.
Tom isn't as bald as I am.
What happened?
The children weren't in bed.
Listen to me.
Could you please lower your voice?
A big typhoon is approaching.
A ball hit the back of my head while I was playing soccer.
I'll be on duty tonight.
"You've eaten lunch, haven't you?"
Do you want an umbrella?
Will she get well soon?
I've never stayed out this late walking before.
Go and see who it is.
Did you decide to go to Japan?
Does Tom know that I'm here?
Can you tie a bow?
She's well known as a singer.
Hamsters are cute.
How many bracelets do you think Mary has?
"Look, there's a cat on the roof."
I was just in Boston.
The movie was so boring that I fell asleep.
The baby was born en route to the hospital.
The picture is fuzzy.
I have no appetite.
"Since the climate here is very mild, it seldom snows here even in the winter."
"Where are you staying? ""At that hotel."""
You forgot to turn off the light.
Answer my questions.
Let's speak in English.
Are you enjoying it?
Do you mind if I turn on the radio?
I don't get what you mean.
"The other day, I found a book written by my father."
What do you want to do?
I had an upset stomach after dinner last night.
You should keep your word.
I'll see to it that you get a raise after the first year.
Do you enjoy cooking?
She bought two dozen eggs.
I don't watch TV at all.
I want us to get back together.
"When people are talking, don't interrupt."
That place is worth visiting at least once.
I managed to get two tickets for the concert.
I helped my younger sister with her homework.
We're likely to get there before dark.
I'm Tom's bodyguard.
He was very tired.
Did you take this picture yourself?
He really is over seventy.
Tom wrote Mary a love letter.
I beg your pardon. I didn't quite catch your name.
Good luck.
The bottle smashed to pieces.
"Hey, are you listening to me?"
Are you seriously thinking about driving all night?
I planned to do that alone.
I'll be with you as soon as I finish this job.
It's a good idea.
Tom was worried about Mary.
I'm going to see her tomorrow.
Do your parents know?
I picked out a new hat at the store.
Everyone laughed at Tom's jokes.
I arrived too early.
There are a lot of hot springs in Japan.
Do come again.
Tom was able to do it.
I'm just kidding.
Are you an idiot?
I'll find another job.
Get out of the classroom.
He came home at six.
Tom gave his three-year-old son a puppy as a Christmas present.
Everything went better than I had expected.
We would like to buy a sofa.
It's going to clear up soon.
There is no excuse for such behavior.
No one wants to be around Tom.
Tom was thirty years old at that time.
This car isn't worth repairing.
Come here right away.
Tom opened the door before Mary had a chance to knock.
How about playing tennis?
You'll catch another cold if you aren't careful.
My father will travel abroad next year.
She felt insecure about her future.
Would you please sign this document?
Taking off is easier than landing.
"In the winter, I have no desire to eat ice cream."
"When I entered the room, she was playing the piano."
He said that he had left his wallet at home.
He faced toward the sea.
He failed in his attempt to swim across the river.
It's unfortunately true.
Don't lean on the door.
He grew potatoes in his garden.
Come over here and sit down.
Tom's finished.
I don't have a favorite shirt.
She did not turn up after all.
My parents and I live together.
I'm clean.
There is a large river near our town.
Tom is talking to himself.
I gave my father some flowers.
Tom wasn't wearing his glasses.
Tom doesn't have time.
Do you go shopping every day?
I get the feeling that I've heard that somewhere before.
The jets took off one after another.
None of your business.
I thought you were broke.
When will you come back home?
Don't read books like this.
Hold it!
I ran all the way to the station.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
Computers save us a lot of time and trouble.
I shouldn't've done it.
I bought Tom a new car.
I bought an eight-acre farm for my retirement.
Tom isn't back yet.
Do you still have a copy of yesterday's newspaper?
Tom seems to be unable to interact normally with other people.
Don't dwell on your past failures.
There are beautiful lakes here and there.
You shouldn't have eaten the fish raw.
I've always been proud of Tom.
I'll make you happy.
Tom is the tallest in his family.
What's taking you so long?
Aren't you mad at Tom?
Tom says he's fluent in three languages.
Did you sew this by hand?
Where can I make a phone call?
Their rude behavior makes me angry.
"Wow, this is different."
I'd like to work with Tom.
I wanted to help you.
Check your spam folder.
Tom walks slowly.
"Were I to die, who would look after my children?"
He deals in used cars.
Do you know him?
I like bourbon a lot.
What did you major in at college?
Tom bought Mary a present.
She became a great artist.
I will study abroad when I have finished school.
"Will you fill out this form, please?"
I'm afraid I won't finish on time.
My daughter is being potty trained.
Tom's illness resulted from eating too much.
Call me.
I got up while it was still dark.
Tom doesn't really talk about his problems much.
We should've taken the schedule into consideration.
Do you think we're stupid?
You are on the wrong train.
I need your help.
I think that I ate too much chocolate.
I did smoke when I was young.
Tom and Mary are both really competitive.
The wind has died down.
I thought that you might be able to give me a hand.
I wish I were dead.
I saw a squirrel this morning.
"Tom has borrowed over 3,000 dollars from Mary."
"This is my umbrella, not Tom's."
"As long as it's cheap, any watch will do."
The pump didn't work properly.
There's an empty seat over there.
Your fate is in my hands.
Give me five days.
Is there room for one more person?
"If it were not for electricity, our civilized life would be impossible."
I went to bed without eating dinner.
Leave my family alone.
"I have to be up early tomorrow morning, so I'm going to bed."
It's difficult to break bad habits.
This clock seems to be broken.
Please tell Tom I'll be a few minutes late.
I gave up smoking a year ago.
We need a new babysitter.
"Are you in a hurry? ""Not really."""
I don't like novels without heroes.
Please feel free to take a look.
She refused to accept his proposal.
"It's very hot, isn't it?"
I have neither time nor money.
The coffee is on me.
I've lost my briefcase.
I wasn't sleeping in class. I just zoned out for a bit.
Do you think I should allow Tom to do that?
Is that so strange?
Are you sure that you don't want to go to Australia with Tom?
Can you give me a ride to the station?
Don't come again.
I'm staying at the Hilton Hotel.
How long should I microwave this?
No one helped me.
I was just joking.
He always keeps his room clean.
Would you please be quiet for a minute?
She always walks to school.
Tom has messed up everything.
I'll give you a ride home.
Where should we meet tomorrow?
He knew how to put his ideas across.
Are you on dope?
"Whenever I meet you, I think of your mother."
He has no right to interfere in our family affairs.
Lie down and rest for a while.
I'll make some coffee.
I am ready for death.
Do you think Tom is happy?
I speak almost no French.
Set your mind at ease.
I'm not in the mood for pizza.
There are some tomatoes in the refrigerator.
I have a slight pain in my side.
Is Tom able to speak French?
Can we go over there?
Can you speak English?
The server was down.
Is Tom in Australia now?
Memorize this.
Tom participated in the Boston marathon.
He has a lot of hobbies.
Either go out or come in.
She's grown up to be a beautiful woman.
The basements are flooded.
"Answer the telephone, will you?"
Our coach is Canadian.
Tom wanted to scare Mary.
You were wrong after all.
Where is the United Airlines check-in counter?
I bought this book the other day.
I hope Tom doesn't catch a cold.
Don't talk to me before I've had my coffee.
We ought to help each other.
The train ran off the tracks.
Why don't we get together again tomorrow?
Mt. Everest is the highest peak in the world.
I got my son to cook supper.
School begins at half past eight.
I'm thinking of moving.
It's me.
There was a party for graduates today.
What kind of mushroom is this?
"Sorry, but I'm not very interested in that subject."
Tom and Mary are playing pool.
Tom had his socks on inside out.
"Now that we're alone, let's have fun."
Tom and Mary are both very good singers.
"I, too, am a teacher."
I'm up in the attic.
Tom and I both started laughing.
I used to visit used bookstores all the time.
Don't let that dog come near me!
I am older than him.
"I think you worry too much, Tom."
"Because it started to rain, I couldn't use my camera."
Is everything all right in there?
The road was blocked by a fallen tree.
I got a Christmas card from Tom.
He got off the bus.
I can't afford the time to travel.
We get a lot of rain in June.
I'll never forget what Tom did for me.
I've lost my car key.
Is that what Tom would want?
The conference is to be held in Tokyo the day after tomorrow.
She kept on working.
I pray every day.
May I have your name?
Did you brush your teeth?
No one was listening to what he was saying.
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school tomorrow morning.
The train has arrived.
He seems to know us.
Let me tell you why I don't like Tom.
She has a tender heart.
Where are you going?
The plans have been drawn up.
Cherry trees are planted along the street.
My father takes a bath before supper.
A time bomb went off at the airport and killed 13 people.
I'd like a muffin.
She advised him to exercise.
People love dogs.
I'm tired of waiting.
You will be able to speak fluent English in another few months.
Is that a dog?
Were you aware of this?
The problem is that we don't have enough time.
"Hey, I thought you'd be pleased."
There isn't much difference between the two.
He knows a lot about foreign affairs.
I was involved in the quarrel.
Try this milk.
I have to help my mother.
He doesn't know what to do with his money.
Is this pen yours?
He compared the copy with the original.
Eat wherever you want.
Could you please speak more quietly? I'm hungover.
Could you please tell me your name again?
Are you ready to go yet?
Tom ate instant ramen for lunch.
There are many old people in this village.
We're looking forward to seeing you again.
I’ve got a sprained ankle.
Lend me something interesting to read.
He was the king of rock-and-roll.
Did you complete the work?
Will Tom play squash?
Do all of you speak Chinese?
"Since I'd never met Tom before, I didn't know him."
Have you decided to go to Australia?
Tom isn't doing anything.
Philosophy is often regarded as difficult.
Is her story true?
He could not bring himself to believe her story.
The problem isn't settled yet.
The train left on schedule.
Our efforts will soon bear fruit.
I've already turned off my computer.
You should know better now that you're an adult.
Please call me around 7:30.
They got married.
We live near a big library.
"Someone said something, but I could not understand it."
I'm sorry to have taken up your valuable time.
He hoped to succeed.
"You always talk back to me, don't you?"
Many small companies went bankrupt.
I don't think Tom can win.
"He arrived an hour late, which annoyed me very much."
I'll study tomorrow.
My pulse is fast.
I asked Tom about Mary.
Tom might have cancer.
I'm going to buy myself a motorcycle.
Tom's efforts were in vain.
Please listen very carefully.
"Tickets are valid for just two days, including the day they're purchased."
They don't speak French here.
Tom wished he had put more money into that investment.
I got a lot of insect bites in the woods.
It looks like you've been busy today.
Do you want to get together after work?
He deserted his family and went abroad.
Don't tell anyone.
Have you ever climbed Mt. Fuji?
This is an extremely important point.
Do you like Boston?
Tom picked up the glass of water and took a sip.
Tom made a sandwich for me.
They will be very glad.
I've messed up.
There are exceptions to every rule.
He's three years younger than my older brother.
You don't seem too surprised.
Why does Tom have such a negative attitude?
"Had it not been for your help, I couldn't have done it."
Our teacher will go to the USA next month.
What time do you leave home in the morning?
The party was a success.
"At the very least, say ""thank you."""
We were very sleepy the next morning.
You should go to the hospital.
His temperature is normal.
"Fortunately, I was on time."
I went to the zoo with my sister.
All aboard!
It's still moving.
How much are the carrots?
I'm looking for a place to live.
You're looking very well.
He is still on the payroll of the company.
He achieved great success in life.
"How old are you? ""I'm 16 years old."""
One of your shoes is dirty.
"If Tom could do that, he would've already done it."
"Being left alone, the boy didn't know what to do."
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I have to open the window.
I would sooner die than give up.
Which one do you want?
There were a lot of people.
Here he is!
I don't have chains for my car.
There's a man that I don't know in front of the house.
He plays the piano better than me.
How was the concert?
I don't think that many people can say they are satisfied with their salary.
What's the weather like in Boston now?
He still wants to come.
Don't look back.
Please call me a doctor.
The wound hasn't healed yet.
I'd like to try this dress on.
Tell me more about what happened.
This is a little gift for you.
"How do you say ""thank you"" in French?"
This medicine tastes bitter.
I really enjoyed the meal.
He gets up early.
I broke up with her yesterday evening.
Tom showers every morning.
I suspect that Tom and Mary are biased.
A lion killed Tom.
I can understand why you might not want to go.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a wedding ring.
Can I pay with a credit card?
I promise that I'll come back.
The accident took place near that intersection.
I'm not tired at all.
He lay injured on the ground.
Tom bought Mary a gift.
I feel better now.
The vase fell to the floor and shattered.
Tom had a pistol.
I'll do whatever it takes.
We anticipate a heavy rainfall tomorrow.
Shut your eyes.
Is that Japanese food?
"If you have any questions, feel free to call."
This computer runs on batteries.
He got fired for slacking off at work.
"What are you looking for, sir?"
Give a tissue to Tom.
Is it tough working at McDonald's?
Tom hates getting up early in the morning.
A golf ball hit Tom.
"Walking along the street, I met an old friend of mine."
I got to the station only to find that the train had just left.
I'm not very good at swimming.
It's true.
Thank you so much for your help.
I promise.
What time does this restaurant close?
Who was driving the hearse?
Please turn the television on.
"To make matter worse, the traffic was bad."
That glass is yours.
I can't explain the difference between those two.
"Watch your step, or you will slip and fall."
It's never too late to learn.
Tom entered his password.
Could you share your honest opinion on this issue?
You should do it this way.
Did Tom die?
She called for help.
The game will be held even if it rains.
Wine and cheese go together well.
Can I borrow a dollar?
Where is the lost and found?
Tom won't even look at me.
It's weird.
The building was totally destroyed by the earthquake.
What's your favorite cheese to eat when drinking wine?
My mother taught me that it's not polite to point.
I want to do this by myself.
Is this clock working?
Three were sentenced to life in prison.
Can I borrow your scissors?
Today is a good day for a picnic.
I ran upstairs.
What are you so nervous about?
My brother is washing the dishes.
Mary put her piano up for sale.
"In Japan, the new semester begins in April."
Tom lives alone in an apartment.
What are you laughing at?
The meat is tough.
He gave up smoking two years ago.
Are you lost?
Where does this road lead to?
Today was a tiring day.
See you next week!
There wasn't anything in the basket.
"No, thank you. I'm just looking."
She accompanied me to the hospital.
Someone is waiting for you downstairs.
I think Tom is boring.
I won't help you.
I was too tired to go on working.
Animals can't distinguish right from wrong.
Two heads are better than one.
I need a knife.
Don't hesitate to ask me any questions.
A good many people were there.
I asked her to wait a minute.
I can't put up with it.
Let's get down to brass tacks and make a decision.
My back is stiff.
I'm not a hundred percent wrong.
I never dreamed I'd meet you here.
I feel refreshed.
She changed her schedule to match his.
What were the chief events of 1990?
"Excuse me, how much is this?"
Tom ordered orange juice.
"I recognized him at once, because I had seen him before."
"Thanks to my mother's help, I was able to buy a mountain bike."
I'll stand by you no matter what happens.
You may go as long as you come home early.
It is dangerous to play in the street.
The game is over.
"What's your name? ""My name's Tom."""
I think you should wake Tom up.
How do I eat this?
This novel was written by a famous American writer.
I didn't get your name.
This is Room 839.
Never tell a lie again.
Is this seat empty?
Tom talks quickly.
I regret that I didn't tell Tom the truth.
You'll have bleeding for a few hours.
He doesn't know how to play the guitar.
Did you write anything in your diary today?
Tom was plastered.
"If you lie, I'll punish you."
The ladder was covered with dust and rust.
I have no friends.
Mary and Alice are both expecting babies.
The transfer student in the other class is a super good-looking guy.
Why do you hate surprise parties?
Spring will be here before long.
He retired to his own room after supper.
I go to the barber's once a month.
I bought two loaves of bread.
Thanks for your hard work.
Did you pass the test?
I hate people who talk like that.
I got to Australia three days before Tom did.
"In all my travels, I've never seen a more beautiful mountain than Mt. Everest."
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
Don't tell anybody.
Where did you put your key?
This is the book I've been looking for.
They left the town an hour ago.
Do as I tell you.
"I don't have money, but I have dreams."
I hurt my knee playing soccer.
He said that he would let us know later about the results of the examination.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
I have two brothers and a sister.
She returned from a trip.
Fantastic!
The workers came to ask about their pay raises.
I wonder whether or not the weather will hold.
The computer repair took all day.
I can't pronounce this word.
Anything's fine.
Don't call me up after ten o'clock.
I don't know what it is.
I'll return immediately.
Tom did errands for Mary.
I plan on going to Boston.
"Tom is planning to go, no matter what happens."
It's been three years since I started to study French.
I slapped him.
It's OK. Don't worry.
Why are you asking me that?
My shoes are worn out.
I'm famished.
Have you already finished?
I was wrong. Forget what I told you.
She answered in tears.
Someone needs to translate this contract into French.
"She has 2,000 books."
That singer is going to become popular.
I love your cooking.
Tom is as fast as a leopard.
I overslept because my alarm didn't go off.
This is the last straw!
He turned off all the lights at eleven.
Tom will come tomorrow.
He isn't smart enough to add up numbers in his head.
It's a cloudy day.
There used to be a church here.
Have a look at the world map.
I caught him trying to go out of the room.
Mary likes you.
This stone was too heavy for me to lift.
Are you interested in astrology?
I forgot my glasses.
You're going too far.
Why are you so clumsy?
I've got to get out of here.
I shouldn't've lied.
"You're wrong. Tom plays the clarinet, not the saxophone."
Tom skated on the frozen pond.
Tom often goes to school by bicycle.
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
He hurt his left hand with a knife.
Did you really run three kilometers?
There isn't time to explain in detail.
What do you say to eating out tonight?
I'm looking for a good computer.
"Tom, did you find your book?"
He's lazy.
Which is the real one?
The police had the witness explain in detail how the accident had happened.
Don't get angry.
It seemed that he was sick.
Modern technology has made our lives more comfortable.
Cut it out!
This stove burns oil.
Would you like another beer?
Have you ever been to Tom's house?
Do you like these colors?
I used to swim in this river.
It became dark before I knew it.
I searched my pockets for my wallet.
The concert will start soon.
I know Tom says he doesn't like me.
Did you rent an apartment?
Lunch break is an hour long.
I'll buy this.
The well is dry.
Who did you see at the station?
Why were you driving Tom's car?
"My mother disliked caterpillars, not to mention snakes."
How did that happen?
I think the rain's getting heavier.
"I want to make a phone call, but I don't have any change now."
Are you and Tom getting back together?
She went out without saying a word.
Wake up.
We'll visit Boston soon.
The posters were immediately removed from the wall.
My mother left home ten minutes ago.
I know.
"Tom had a pain in his chest, so he went to the hospital."
I was saving up to buy a new bicycle.
"She has about 2,000 books."
I take the bus to school.
I'll give up smoking.
You're really a hard worker.
Tom is bad at French.
My husband is out of work and looking for a job.
Students don't raise their hands much.
That chimney is very high.
I'm not here to arrest you.
It rained hard all day.
Do it yourself and do it right away.
"Excuse me, what time is it?"
That boy likes that girl.
It's not easy for me.
Tom probably went to his friend's house.
Tom doesn't have any brothers and sisters.
Italian pasta is delicious.
There's blood on this knife.
He is confined to bed now.
How far along are you?
"When I was taking a bath, the telephone rang."
The moon is low in the sky.
"You can swim, can't you?"
We took shelter under a tree.
Don't expect too much of him.
"Now, I want to drink beer."
"She grows flowers such as tulips, pansies and daisies."
Tickets are expensive.
I'm no longer a child.
Tom is an interpreter.
I don't want to hurt anybody.
They interrupted the meeting for lunch.
How many Chinese friends do you have?
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll do it if you show me how.
Straighten up.
You're not fit to be seen.
I am surprised to see you here in this hotel.
She helped the old man across the street.
What makes you think Tom won't come?
"Tom's apartment is small, but it's very cozy."
The war started in 1941.
I don't understand how to do it.
I'm behind him.
I got in my car and went for a drive because I couldn't sleep.
Could you send this letter for me?
It has no bearing on this problem.
He caught me by the arm.
You ought to do that immediately.
I need new gloves.
The situation will surely get better.
Welcome to our home.
We should wait here for the moment.
Are you awake?
Why don't you like the way you speak?
Call 110 right now.
What time do you usually have breakfast?
Keep away from me.
Stay here with me.
I work at a library.
I changed jobs.
There's no room for doubt.
It's not a joke.
The express arrives at 6:30 p.m.
I wonder whether Tom is able to understand French.
How will you do this?
"Anyhow, let's begin."
Would you mind if I left a little early?
Let's make it Monday afternoon.
Tom looks proud of his son.
Is the boss in a good mood today?
I wish I could've done that myself.
Tom was born and raised in Australia.
Would you like some cake?
Stop gambling.
Are you still feeling sick?
"Instead of going to Europe, I decided to go to America."
I'd zip it if I were you.
I want to stay at a five-star hotel.
Shall we start?
It is extremely hot and humid in Bali in December.
Have you ever been to that restaurant?
"Yesterday, my friends and I went to the river and enjoyed ourselves."
Tom is interested in mathematics.
"Check, please."
The wounded soldier could hardly walk.
Are you free tomorrow?
I don't believe in ghosts.
I like your way of smiling.
I skipped the first few pages of the book.
Would you mind my opening the window?
Play with the cats.
The poor boy was knocked down by a car.
I know that you're hiding behind the curtain.
Air is a mixture of several gases.
I need a good pair of sunglasses.
We'll talk with Tom.
Tom got fatter.
Come and see me from time to time.
"I can't fold another crane, she said to herself."
Are cats smarter than dogs?
What's the meaning of life?
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight.
The teacher's face was bright red.
That movie was really good.
"Are you, by any chance, afraid of me?"
I would like to try this dress on.
Tom knew that Mary was going to be arrested.
I wish the rainy season would end soon.
My father converted a garage into a study.
Do you own this house or rent it?
I've been wanting to see you.
May I park here?
We just arrived at the station.
A baby is sleeping in the cradle.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
Could you please not leave the door open?
Have you ever fallen off a ladder?
We're in the black this month.
I hope you have sweet dreams.
Let's put this in the safe.
What is the story?
I like this watch.
He stuck with his own theory.
"May I use this telephone? ""Go ahead."""
The tablecloth is in the cupboard.
It's not butter. It's margarine.
I hate French.
I will go on ahead.
Why do you use this font?
We have five days to go before the summer vacation.
Tom and Mary told me that they speak French.
I should not have said that.
He is prone to getting excited.
She easily catches cold.
She abandoned her children.
I can't help it.
It's already eleven. It's high time you were in bed.
I want to be a dentist in the future.
We were supposed to help Tom yesterday afternoon.
It's not this one.
Get used to it.
Why didn't I die?
The opera starts at seven.
Tom sat under a tree and watched people walk by.
Give me a break.
Pipe down!
"Whose chair is this? ""It is mine."""
There are usually cabs in front of the station.
The house is heated by solar energy.
We dined at our uncle's.
She gets prettier day by day.
Show me where it hurts.
He bought me a nice camera.
Tom is a bit conceited.
When was the last time you had a physical?
You need to relax.
Both of the girls are wearing white suits.
Don't touch the blue button.
I heard the news by chance.
He shot at me.
"It is a nice day, isn't it?"
The temperature went down to minus ten degrees centigrade last night.
This camera isn't loaded with film.
"Excuse me, I think you're sitting in my seat."
Tom wants to be a French teacher.
I'd like to thank everyone for their support.
Do you have money for a ticket?
I am talking with Tom.
I want to go to another country.
Do your children drink milk?
I don't have a smartphone yet.
I wonder why women live longer than men.
There are a lot of books in the library.
This is your captain speaking.
Ask him the way to the station.
I take lessons in flower arrangement.
Let's put this in the trunk.
Tom Jackson's novel sold well.
I don't mind if you go to bed before I get home.
I wish that you had told me the truth then.
I gave Tom the map.
How many people have you told?
Whose friend is he?
"There are a few apples on the tree, aren't there?"
Don't be afraid to fail.
Tom is the third youngest child in his kindergarten class.
Everyone knows the news.
We work for our living.
I told you Tom could do that.
Peel the potatoes and the carrots.
It happened quite recently.
I'm not always free on Sundays.
I'll pass by the post office on my way home.
That was three and a half years ago.
Do you know how to do that?
"With your children away, you must have a lot of free time."
Show me tangible data.
That's my favorite part.
I got there in time for the train.
The interview is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
You're a troublesome person!
Tom was a professional gambler before he met Mary.
I've lost interest in golf.
I didn't know what to say.
Sugar isn't healthy.
Are you telling me to stop?
A dog bit me.
I've decided not to go to Boston this weekend.
We're so busy we'll take any help we can get.
The stew was not half bad.
Shall I buy this for you?
I had my brother repair my bicycle.
I was able to do it once.
Did you notice any change?
Would it be OK if I sat here?
"Write the answer in English, please."
Shut up and drink.
You should know better than to talk back to your boss.
I promise not to peek.
I'm sorry that I made you wait.
She makes a point of taking a shower before breakfast.
Tom and Mary are both really tall.
She sometimes hesitates before answering.
A form appeared in the darkness.
I can read.
I didn't drive here.
"You lied about kissing Tom, didn't you?"
Tell Tom in person.
Tom always wondered what it was like inside a spaceship.
I might be at home tonight.
I know that boy standing over there.
"No, thank you. I'm full."
I've just been to the airport to see her off.
I want to eat fried rice.
This song was written by Foster.
We import grain from the United States.
"Could you take me to a hospital, please?"
Did you buy a round-trip ticket?
I promise I'll find you a job.
It was sold out.
Why not?
We have to wear school uniforms at school.
The milk went sour.
Math and English were my favorite subjects.
Life ends once you become married.
Tom moved here three months ago.
Where's the toothpaste?
My house is a long way from here.
What are you talking about?
This beer is not cold enough.
You don't have to answer this question.
The door slowly opened.
What a nerve!
I've been there once.
Would you believe me if I told you that I love you?
The train will come in at platform ten.
Do you believe in destiny?
She has some beautiful antique furniture.
She had a little round object in her hand.
Don't tell Tom what really happened.
"Two coffees, please."
"If you break it again, I'm not fixing it."
I was bitten by a lot of insects in the forest.
Now eat your supper.
We'd better call the police.
"Tom didn't use to like red wine, but now he drinks it almost every day."
I'll be back.
Tom understands.
"To determine its origin, we must go back to the middle ages."
I don't speak Swedish.
Mary spread the big map on the table.
Who broke the cup?
I found the photo you were looking for.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.
The ground beef was found to contain horse meat.
I'm a Cancer.
Tom seems conceited.
He is still sitting on the bench.
It might rain. We should take umbrellas with us.
Does Tom ever wear a tie?
"We get tired of beautiful women in three days, but in three days, we get used to ugly women."
He stood on the surface of the moon.
Could you open the window?
I'd like to check in.
I had a dream about him.
I can't lend you that much money.
Let's be fair.
There's no milk in the refrigerator.
That discovery was quite accidental.
Don't close your eyes.
I have seen a UFO.
Come back tomorrow.
My father neither smokes nor drinks.
Twelve people were injured in the accident.
He tidied up his room.
Tom plants sunflowers every spring.
Are you planning on helping them?
I'll pick you up at half past two.
Try not to yawn.
Do you wear glasses?
It's great that you were able to achieve your goals.
Would you like a cup of tea?
"Where are you? ""I'm here."""
Time is up.
It's time to feed the dog.
He hid behind the door.
I go to bed at eleven.
This curry is too hot.
There are people who don't like spinach.
Are you coming tomorrow?
He didn't say a word.
Science is based on very careful observations.
Our cat is in the kitchen.
"Which is heavier, lead or gold?"
She retired at the age of 60.
I wanted to be your wife.
"Now that he has quit his job, I can't depend on him."
"If it snows, I won't go outside."
Did Tom give any other advice?
Do you honor this credit card?
You shouldn't interfere in other people's business.
"She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are."
I couldn't call you. The telephone was out of order.
He's just like his grandfather.
Tom speaks English with a heavy French accent.
I'm convinced of that.
Were you really in Boston?
I'll buy you anything you want.
Where's the bathroom?
He's a friend from work.
"I know it's not easy, but you've got to at least try."
I admire Tom.
Do we have to go?
I am playing it safe.
"Now that you are eighteen, you can get a driver's license."
Doing that was more difficult than I expected.
What a heavy bag!
Did you watch TV yesterday?
Please be careful not to break this vase.
Have a seat.
When did you start learning French?
Tom was a little overweight when he was a kid.
You will do well to take my advice.
This is how the accident happened.
It looks like you've gained a little weight.
I'm OK. I've just been busy recently.
This coffee is too bitter.
I'm not Mary's type.
It'd be better not to go out.
What he said turned out to be true.
I wonder if Tom really was at school today.
It's been raining since last Saturday.
The population is increasing.
"I started cycling to lose weight, and then I fell in love with it."
What do you do in your free time?
May I take a few days off to visit my family?
We've planted the garden.
I caught a big fish yesterday with my bare hands.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
I'm sitting in the railway station.
Is Tom correct?
Will you tell me the way to the library?
I like boiled eggs.
I usually spend weekends at home.
Reflect on what you have done.
Chess is hard.
"For the time being, I intend to stay at a hotel."
I don't want to marry a lazy person.
I kept singing.
I'd like to go skiing.
Didn't I tell you that you didn't need to worry about that?
Don't eat too much candy.
I sold it for ten dollars.
I've lived here all my life.
Now it's our turn.
Tom seemed to be in good spirits.
In the summer I always sleep with the window open.
This one is free.
Do you have one a little smaller?
Is he breathing?
I think I'll take the long way home today.
I'm not a coward.
Who taught Tom how to bake bread?
I want to sleep.
Am I going to die?
She closed the door tightly behind her.
Tom later died at the hospital.
I'm going to be here several days.
You have to stay here.
It looks painful.
You should prepare for the future.
My dog eats better meat than I do.
I love this city.
Coffee's ready.
The soap bubble burst.
I promise that I'll never do it again.
My mother loves music.
"I hear you quit your job. ""Actually, I got fired."""
You are not supposed to play baseball here.
Do you know how to speak French?
Which one do you think is right?
I've invited my friends.
She is too young to know the truth.
Tom is a fussy eater.
You'd better not wait here.
Tom doesn't know how to use a snorkel.
When and where did you two meet?
What's your favorite summer food?
What am I to do?
What made you change your mind?
The telephone doesn't work.
He went there on business.
We usually sleep in this room.
I think that Tom will like this wine.
This box will serve as a chair.
I can't eat meat.
Tom and Mary are still married.
He glanced at his watch.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Can I see you at ten tomorrow?
Tom doesn't trust anybody.
We can see Mt. Fuji over there.
My dream is to be a doctor.
"Sorry, I can't stay for long."
Let me have a look at it.
I need to borrow three hundred dollars.
I asked my friends for advice.
What were you doing when it began to rain?
I don't know you anymore.
I promise I'll be back by 7 o'clock.
Bigger is not always better.
I think that I'll go and take a bath.
All of the goldfish are dead.
I remember seeing her somewhere.
Is the airport far?
The spokesman explained the contents of the treaty to the press.
"Wait, don't shoot!"
How many times a month do you go to the movies?
Do you know why I'm here?
I'm about to tell you something important.
"I was ill, otherwise I would've attended the meeting."
There are two pencils on the table.
Tom chugged his beer.
"When you said you'd look after Spot, you knew there'd be responsibilities."
Is lunch included in this price?
I'm not that smart.
"To look at him, you'd take him for a girl."
I was eating dinner then.
"Excuse me, where is the exit?"
I know you're working part-time.
I am afraid she is ill.
Get your friend to help you.
I feel sad.
Perhaps he'll never become famous.
I sympathize.
How old is your oldest son?
I doubt that Tom will ever learn how to speak French properly.
"Yesterday, a thief entered the house."
The chocolate that Tom is eating was given to him by his girlfriend.
My grandmother had an operation in Germany.
What are the differences between dogs and wolves?
She is going to learn how to drive.
That's not necessary.
The twin girls were so much alike that I couldn't tell one from the other.
Today is the fifth day of continual stock price decline.
When will we meet again?
Do you like rap?
He wishes the accident hadn't happened.
I bought a new hat at the mall.
I'd like to see that in black and white.
Tom and Mary have been friends since elementary school.
Are you still at school?
She is on a diet.
This house is too big for me.
I don't think that it'll rain tomorrow.
I couldn't help but laugh.
Is everything OK in there?
Sorry to be late.
Were any weapons found?
Your pants are too tight.
I think I can.
I love romance novels.
Tom wasn't at the meeting.
He is a very smart boy.
May I ask you a question?
"I'm sorry, my father's not here."
"Without your help, we couldn't have done it."
Did Tom pass the test?
Who will take care of the baby?
There's not much difference between the two.
Move forward one step.
I left my gloves in the library.
I'd never go there alone.
I'm already inside.
Tom had no intention of giving up.
I missed a golden opportunity.
I'd like you to come at nine.
Boston is not at all like Chicago.
There is no need for us to hurry.
I met him while he was in Japan.
My mother cut the cake.
Thank you for your letter.
Some newspapers distorted the news.
Tom no longer lives in Boston.
One must do one's best in everything.
He put the ring on Mary's finger.
He came down with a cold.
These boots are hard to walk in.
Who in the world is the fellow over there?
Every man has his faults.
French isn't easy to master.
The cherry blossoms are at their best now.
"Tom shouted, ""There's a fire!"""
We want to know if it'll be sunny tomorrow.
What do you want me to do?
I bike to work.
Can anybody else answer?
She almost drowned.
"Everyone, clean your rooms."
How was today's test?
I'm extremely tired.
He wants to be a tennis player.
Many people have made the same mistake.
What are we going to do about this?
"Strictly speaking, the earth is not round."
Please come as soon as possible.
That red tie doesn't go with your suit. Why don't you wear the green one?
Here we are.
I can't answer this question.
Don't pay any attention to what your father says.
I'm a Canadian.
Don't forget Tom.
He was sentenced to death.
Who is this boy?
Traffic accidents happen daily.
There are wolves in these woods.
Tom said you speak French better than Mary.
I don't mind lending some money to you.
The plane dropped bombs on the city.
Your zipper's open.
Where can I get tickets?
I can't put up with that loud noise.
Try to speak English as often as possible if you want to improve your English.
Thank you very much.
I did that without asking for anyone's advice.
We're sorry about the bad weather.
Tom didn't study French yesterday.
Let's sit down on that bench.
I do not know when she will come back.
That book is sold out.
He was looking at the sky.
Hug Tom.
It has cooled off.
Music and art can greatly contribute to the enjoyment of life.
Were you able to ride a bicycle when you were five years old?
Tom explained the matter in detail.
You are not our friend.
Call me when you're ready.
Why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
I won't tell a soul.
"Tom was your boyfriend when you were in high school, wasn't he?"
I'm quite comfortable in this room.
My brother leaves his room in a mess.
The one who saved me was that kid.
Tom will take the 2:30 train.
My vision is getting worse these days.
I don't support his ideas.
"I, too, have goldfish."
I don't know anybody here in this town.
Tom was totally wasted.
She looks happy.
Math is her favorite subject in school.
That was the last time I saw Tom.
"If you face north, the east is on your right."
I thought everything went well.
I want to be friends with you.
Put a little of brandy in my tea.
I don't have a ticket.
I never dreamed that there would be a typhoon.
It sounds like you had fun.
I saw an otter.
"Some people like sports, and others don't."
My family isn't all that large.
I don't understand what that man is talking about.
I was nervous before the exam.
I'm very sorry I got home so late.
This beer is the best.
There's a hole in this bucket.
I want a peanut butter sandwich.
Tom didn't seem to know Mary.
She folded her handkerchief neatly.
I have two children.
Industrialization had a great influence on the development of the economy in Japan.
The hunters shot at the elephant.
She disappeared in the dark.
Do you know how to play?
I forgot to pay my rent this month.
She burst out crying with joy when she heard the news.
I want to be your friend.
He is particularly kind to her.
I finished doing the work before supper.
It suddenly started raining.
Who was that man waiting outside?
You'll get it someday.
It's pouring.
I'd like a glass of wine.
I believe that you're right.
What would you like to drink?
Let's hide here.
Buy him a beer.
Don't be ridiculous!
Answer the question.
Why don't we go out for dinner?
You should go home.
I couldn't hear a thing.
He threw a rock into the pond.
That's completely beside the point.
"Sorry, I've got a lot on my plate right now."
Tom shut the office door.
How long should we leave it in the oven?
Tom should've chosen a different job.
I'd like a cup of tea.
I know what's real and what isn't.
Where are your daughters?
How can I explain this?
How far is it from Osaka to Kyoto?
Have you completed your preparations for tomorrow?
I don't translate for free.
She is unable to cope with stress.
Please open the bottle.
Tom hasn't had a fight with anybody lately.
Maybe next week we can do it.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I really trust his ability.
The dog wants to go out again.
Would you like to join our team?
"Last night you forgot to turn off the radio, didn't you?"
Would you please write with a ballpoint pen?
"One is new, and the other is old."
Mary wore her favorite necklace.
I can't understand what you're saying.
"Tom is shorter than me, isn't he?"
Do you know what this is?
"He did not know what to do, and held his head in his hands."
Go away!
I'm not hungry.
Tom never listens to me.
I don't know if I have enough money.
I don't consider myself to be good-looking.
"It was hot, so I turned on the fan."
Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.
I hope it rains tomorrow.
"He shot many lions, elephants, and other animals."
I've been wanting to meet you for a long time.
I want to eat lobster again tonight.
Make yourselves comfortable.
We shouldn't have gotten up so early.
"He's not a doctor, but a nurse."
Please pass me the salt.
I have something to ask of you.
It's possible that Tom came here when he was young.
Old people get sick easily.
How do you say it in French?
The boy has good reflexes.
It's been ten years since I came to Japan.
Are you even listening to me?
I think a hundred dollars would be enough.
"If you're leaving, please close the door."
We did a lot of singing and dancing at the party.
The history of Rome is very interesting.
"Could you move over a little? ""Oh, sorry. I didn't realize I was taking up so much space."""
How do you like this whisky?
"If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us."
Her kindness touched me.
We walked more quickly than usual.
I thought maybe you'd have an idea.
I can't let you do that.
It's one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
This apple is bad.
Fire!
I don't have money right now.
He takes a walk every morning.
The result was very good.
I'd be happy to go with you.
Did my father really die?
I live near you and Tom.
It's easy to use.
I made a mistake.
You should apologize to Tom.
Light travels faster than sound.
I'll treasure it.
Yukio Mishima killed himself in 1970.
When was your last asthma attack?
Do you want to go somewhere?
I don't know why Tom did it.
"Even though Tom and I have birthdays just one day apart, Tom is one grade ahead of me in school."
He is guilty of theft.
Thank you for your inquiry.
Tom and Mary live with their dad in Boston.
Let's just wing it.
Can anyone help out?
Can I talk to you a moment?
"Art isn't a luxury, but a necessity."
Strawberries are in season now.
What would be a good way to say this?
Were you the one who shut the door?
You need to put air in your tires.
"Who do you like better, Tom or Mary?"
Please let me know immediately if anything happens.
"Lovely sunset, isn't it?"
I can't breathe through my nose.
You must clean your room every day.
Somebody's elbow touched my back.
I worked hard to compensate for the loss.
I need a bottle opener.
Stay out of the rain.
Last night I went out to dinner with my girlfriend.
I spent the major part of my vacation at my uncle's.
I bought her a new car.
She raised her voice.
I still don't know.
I hope tomorrow will be a good day.
Tom said he did that on Monday.
You're so impatient with me.
It is written in simple English.
It's too hot.
I had my watch fixed.
Don't take it seriously.
"The car broke down, so they had to walk."
Don't do anything rash.
I don't like to be kept waiting for a long time.
"Obviously, someone is lying."
Did your parents approve of your marriage?
I want to buy a rice cooker.
Where is the bathroom?
I thought you were kidding.
Tom likes to swim.
I just meant it as a joke.
Let's all stay at the same hotel.
She picked up one of the glass vases.
It's too late to apologize now.
Tom's new car can do 140 kilometers an hour.
Tom recovered.
I must go home.
Do you love me?
"When you've finished reading this letter, burn it."
Apes are intelligent.
No problem.
I'll have to wait.
I'm going to go home.
Let's wait for the rain to stop.
Tom was in the hospital for a few weeks last year.
Do you know Tom's phone number?
What's his job?
What time does the next train leave for Tokyo?
Japan imports various raw materials from abroad.
Can I see you for a moment?
"Are you happy, Tom?"
Don't touch this.
"Compared to Tokyo, London is small."
What'll Tom buy?
I bought a bag of frozen corn.
Do you think the weather will be nice tomorrow?
Which leg hurts?
I'm simply looking.
I thought that you said that you used to live in Boston.
Most of us don't eat a balanced diet.
I have nothing to do with that case.
The town was exactly the same as before.
I bike to work.
I've finished all my homework.
Thank you for writing.
Tom hates yogurt.
We might need to help Tom.
I clean my room every Monday.
The meeting dragged on.
A man's life has its ups and downs.
Do we have any paper clips?
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
I didn't want you to see me crying.
I can hear nothing.
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.
This beer is not cold enough.
I'll quit smoking.
I have sore feet.
I'm here as a translator.
What are Tom and Mary looking for?
Please turn up the sound.
He trimmed his beard for the wedding.
You are to obey your parents.
Purchase any necessary articles quickly.
You'll have to move.
"You don't like sashimi, do you?"
I can't stay long. I have plans.
This road connects the two cities.
I haven't heard from him since then.
What did the doctor say?
Tom bumped his head on the roof of his car.
Never make a nuisance of yourself.
Is this your bicycle?
"Addressing one's boss as ""omae"" is unheard of."
It's really rude to point at people.
I majored in European history in college.
I've already told you that.
I think it's pretty obvious that Tom likes Mary.
The bridge saved me a lot of time.
I asked a simple question.
Life has its ups and downs.
It snowed last night.
Tom said that he's never driven a truck.
I don't understand British humor.
Tom bought three bottles of red wine.
Don't go.
I love hard-boiled eggs.
I was fat when I was a kid.
Tom teaches French every morning.
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
That event happened 15 years ago.
Could you put these in a box?
"After the earthquake, a fire broke out."
"Easy come, easy go."
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
What are you going to do?
This call is free of charge.
She made me hurry.
I want a glass.
Tom continued taking pictures.
They didn't do it.
Do you have anything to wear to the dance?
We don't have school tomorrow.
Why is that baby crying?
Let me show you around town this afternoon.
What are you eyeing?
This house belongs to my uncle.
Tom is a PE teacher.
My room is just below.
Can you answer this question?
Tom said he wanted a divorce.
Could I see your boarding pass?
He was fast asleep.
I saw the picture of the fish you caught.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
Might is right.
I've seen a shooting star once.
Would you like bacon or sausage?
Do you dream in French?
"If I were you, I would paint it blue."
I haven't checked yet.
I think Tom is in trouble.
This is out of my control.
You should arrive at school before 8:30.
I wanted my money back.
He has bad handwriting.
This is the house where I was born.
I'm not used to making speeches in public.
Tom said he had nowhere to go.
Where have you been?
It would be better to try.
How about tomorrow night?
Tom sang a song to Mary.
Wait for me. I'll be there in about ten minutes.
I really hate this.
It's April first.
I don't want to hear any more excuses.
"The train leaves at half past ten, so I'll call for you at ten."
I'll call him later.
Please call me if you want me.
Let's have a snowball fight.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
How did you like the film?
This is too short.
What's the name of the game you're playing?
I'll lose weight.
Would it be OK for me to use that?
I thought that you already knew.
Let's take the 4:10 train.
I didn't mean to offend you.
This dog eats almost anything.
I'll answer that later.
I hit upon a good idea.
Tom tried to run away.
How long was Tom at the park?
I write in my diary every day.
Welcome home.
I know this is none of my business.
Are you reading something interesting?
She greets him every morning.
"Sorry, I don't get your point."
Tom and Mary were both very tired.
I don't have to get up as early as usual tomorrow.
The sun set.
They were scattered in all directions.
Tom isn't here because he's on a business trip.
Say that again.
He is an American.
You're lucky.
It snowed yesterday.
I found the key underneath the mat.
There's a long line at every cash register.
I missed seeing that movie. Did you see it?
It's very ordinary.
I can't agree with Tom.
Do you know how to use this?
How do I get to the airport?
I have caught a cold.
"Where did you go, Tom?"
"Long, long ago, there lived an old king on a small island."
Everybody had looked on him as a good-for-nothing.
Please say it in French.
There isn't any film in this camera.
You should take care of yourself.
I didn't hear what Tom was saying.
Tom told me that he didn't have much money.
Let's go to the movies.
I agree with your opinion about taxes.
I don't think we need to worry.
They aren't swimming in the river.
I sell clothes online.
Tom went to Boston by bus.
I'm learning music.
He didn't see the stop sign and almost hit the child crossing the street.
She played a part in the women's lib movement.
I don't want to be involved with anyone anymore.
I am interested in getting a hat like this.
My parents are both dead.
The building was totally destroyed by the earthquake.
This is the key to the garage.
The baby was in his birthday suit.
Tom was poor his whole life.
There are still a lot of dishes on the table.
Didn't you know that Tom also speaks French?
Must I write in ink?
I'm still not sure about it.
Not everybody can be a poet.
Do I need to go right away?
Has something happened?
How long have you been sick?
I was born and raised in the country.
He is satisfied with the result.
The stars are bright.
Let me cut the carrots.
"Not knowing her telephone number, I couldn't call her."
Which one should I use?
I couldn't see anything but water.
Let's take a break now.
The light suddenly went out.
Did you put oil in the pan?
Please be my girlfriend.
Lunch is ready.
Rock appeals to young men and women.
The TV won't turn on.
The north wind blew all day.
I wish I were an only child.
Do you intend to throw away in one instant what our family has painstakingly built up?
I can't swim very well.
I can hear Tom.
I want to do it myself.
I'll give you a call when I get home.
Did you actually see the accident?
"Just a moment, please."
Tom got hit by a truck.
I ironed out the wrinkles in my pants.
I bought two cotton shirts.
There was no bathroom.
I haven't met him even once.
She was late to school.
"Tom didn't have any hard evidence, but he thought Mary was the one who stole his mother's diamond ring."
One glance at his face told me that he was reluctant to work.
The bread is still hot.
She has a cheerful disposition.
The house is built of red bricks.
I slipped and fell down the stairs.
You're a free man.
Tom didn't stop crying.
Please throw the ball here.
It isn't going to rain this evening.
He likes to work in the garden.
It was my decision and I don't regret it.
Why is Tom wet?
She handed me a postcard.
I don't go in for sports.
What're your plans for the weekend?
Will you take part in the ceremony?
Are you all beginners?
I'd like to stay another night if I can.
There was a full moon last night.
I have a lot of dreams.
He accelerated his car and overtook me.
Tom started crying as well.
He looked quite tired.
I'm against the war.
"Tom is objective, but Mary isn't."
You can use my dictionary.
He entered his room.
I didn't know that you collected stamps.
He stuck the broken pieces together.
The results were unbelievably good.
I couldn't make myself understood.
The balloon popped.
Tom broke his word.
He weighs 270 pounds.
Was the new version easy to install?
I just couldn't say no.
I'm afraid that you have the wrong number.
Have you gotten everything ready for tomorrow?
That was really interesting.
How many coins did you find?
I forgot to turn off the TV before going to bed.
Does Tom go to church?
"Unfortunately, the report is true."
I went through the room into the garden.
Let's go out for some ramen.
I'm afraid I've run short of coffee.
I guess it depends on the weather.
My dream is to take a round-the-world trip.
It was hard as rock.
Tom couldn't stop yawning.
French is my native tongue.
It's in the kitchen.
I'm really tense.
I'm extremely sorry.
We were very busy last week.
Tell Tom I love him.
Even Tom is surprised that Mary lied.
Are you able to swim?
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
You don't need to go.
I see your mind's made up.
I found the book easy.
Nobody was able to solve the problem.
There are almost no books.
"If you don't want to read, then don't read."
I don't like flowers so much.
Are you sleepy?
I think this tastes good.
It was nice and warm inside the house.
I'll be here just for a few days.
He's able to speak Japanese.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
"Is Tom going, too?"
Everything is ready.
Letters won't be delivered.
She almost drowned.
I never thought of that.
You're very good at sewing.
We will never agree.
Do you know this guy?
Can you come to the meeting tonight?
What do you think I should wear for my date tomorrow?
You're smarter than me.
Tom wants to play.
The weather was miserable yesterday.
Make it larger.
A big typhoon is approaching.
I eat bread every day.
Who ate the cheese?
Who did you hear it from?
"Now, I'll take your temperature."
Ostriches can't fly.
You have to do it by yourself.
Are you listening to me?
I heard from Tom.
"Do you like spicy food? ""I love it."""
He was paralyzed by fear.
I don't have any siblings.
Please insert your card.
I don't have children.
The price of gasoline is so high that we cannot buy a big car.
You don't have to be discouraged because you are not a genius.
Which team will win?
Do you know what to do if there's a fire in the building?
Here's your pudding.
He writes to his parents once a month.
Smoking is not allowed here.
Have you seen Tom? I'm looking for him.
"Frankly speaking, this novel isn't very interesting."
Why don't you stop?
"I used to hate cooking, but now I like it."
Mary arrived at the hospital.
Follow me. I know the way.
A good coach is like a parent to the players.
Your French pronunciation is horrible.
Tom seems to be asleep.
I eat lunch with my manager almost every day.
May I borrow your telephone?
We're both Canadians.
My house is near the station.
Did you take back the books?
Tom regrets what he did.
I forgot to open the shutters.
"When I hear that song, I remember my younger days."
Tom and I go to the same high school.
What would it cost to have this chair repaired?
Tom is full of good intentions.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I look forward to seeing them this spring.
I've always loved the idea of not being what people expect me to be.
What did Tom do after dinner?
It was a very hot day.
Tom is the catcher.
What did you do there?
I like the company.
I bought a new camera.
An angle of 90 degrees is called a right angle.
I'm busy with my homework.
"It was hot, and on top of that, humid."
She gets hives when she eats eggs.
This work is anything but easy.
I'll keep this for future use.
"I want cashews, not almonds."
I'm bored.
It won't be as easy as you think.
The leaves began to turn red and yellow.
My father may be home now.
The water is too cold.
It's very smoky in here.
Tom couldn't remember what he'd done.
"At last, we got to the lake."
What school a person graduated from doesn't matter.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Both of my parents can't swim.
"You already know who I'm talking about, don't you?"
He repeated his question.
Are you taking minutes?
It looks like it's going to rain in the afternoon.
Your French is good.
"First, I'll read this."
The news of the accident was a great shock to me.
It's under the bed.
That's too bad.
I don't just watch TV.
I fell asleep with my clothes on.
Is there something you want to say?
Don't move!
He placed the book on the shelf.
Tom disagreed.
I got up early in order to attend the meeting.
"When it comes to mathematics, he is second to none in his class."
They are very big apples.
Did you like the food at that restaurant?
It never occurred to me that my words would hurt her feelings.
The task assigned to him was to do marketing research.
Is there anything you want to talk about?
Do you have money?
Would you please let go of my arm?
I need to change my tires.
Don't give me any more trouble.
"When you're in trouble, you can count on me."
She doesn't seem to be able to catch on to what he is saying.
I'm not as poor as you think I am.
He used me as a guinea pig.
Tom whispered something into Mary's ear.
Let's hide.
"No one's going to get mad at me, I said to myself."
We hope to organize a tennis club.
My job is taking care of our baby.
There's only one bed.
"As soon as you have done that, I would like you to start preparing supper."
What's the trouble? Can I be of any help?
Wait. I can't walk that fast.
A blood transfusion is necessary.
It's too cold for a picnic today.
Have you already read this book?
I need to wash my car.
Bigger isn't always better.
I'm chilled to the bone.
I can't stay long today.
It's so heavy that I can't lift it.
The flu is going around now.
The bay has more yachts than sailboats.
The bad weather delayed the plane.
Do you know what's happened?
I was laughed at by him.
"You know what kind of person Tom is, right?"
"Anyhow, I'm relieved the test is over."
I don't regret it.
Warn Tom.
It was stupid of me to believe that!
I want to buy this dictionary.
"When will you be back? ""It all depends on the weather."""
Dogs can see in the dark.
The reason Tom got sick was because he overate.
You're to do as I tell you.
How long is he going to stay in Japan?
I always eat lunch here.
"To tell you the truth, I'm bored."
Don't say anything.
Was Tom at home yesterday?
Tom fell from his horse.
Typhoon No.9 is approaching Shikoku.
Tom left through the back door.
I relaxed at home last Sunday.
I'd like to perform at Carnegie Hall someday.
Is this cool or what?
It's about time for the guests to arrive.
He presented his card.
A button has come off my raincoat.
I'll win using whatever means it takes.
I can't afford to buy a new car.
I would like to speak to Tom.
What did you eat for lunch today?
I promise that I won't be late tomorrow.
Family communication is important.
What are your favorite movies?
He became a famous actor.
Tom poured himself another shot of bourbon.
What've you been doing?
Let's meet again soon.
He made me a suit.
I wonder which way is the shortest.
I'll show you the car that I just bought.
She was in America last month.
Did you have a big breakfast today?
The car is waxed and shiny.
It was my first overseas trip.
I'll get back to Australia tomorrow.
She and I have about the same number of stamps.
The goods will be delivered free of charge.
I talked with my parents about my studying abroad.
Are you already drunk?
I read your report.
It would be stupid to climb that mountain in the winter.
I count on your help.
"She's your aunt, isn't she?"
Tom isn't married.
Money can't buy freedom.
Do you really care what I think?
They all envied my new car.
Tom turned the light on.
"If necessary, I'll come soon."
He gave up.
He will visit his uncle.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
It's not easy to find a job these days.
I wish I was better at cooking.
I gave up my seat to an old lady.
Tell Tom about what you did the other night.
I tried to open the door.
"Tom isn't going with you, is he?"
Tom is particular about what he eats.
It'd be better to die than live a life like that.
You're taller than me.
"All at once, I heard a shrill cry."
I'm trapped.
Tom poured cold water over himself to wake himself up.
"Tom is the same age as I am, isn't he?"
Tom said he thought that Mary would be absent.
You'd better not walk around in such a place.
I don't know what it is.
Why don't you go home?
She is really into knitting.
We're having a three-day weekend this week.
I've finished cleaning my room.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
I have a dog.
The medicine had an immediate effect.
There is no connection between them.
Where are the car keys?
I think it's pretty good.
Do you know when Tom's plane is arriving?
I need to go to the hospital.
Get up. It's time for school.
I'm going to work now.
About how many times an hour do these buses leave?
The weather really is lovely.
Tomorrow's Tom's thirteenth birthday.
Could I please use your phone?
Don't worry about that.
What time is the concert?
Mary would often sit alone on the porch.
Was Tom seriously hurt?
You didn't need to bring your umbrella.
My friend is seriously injured.
I awoke to find it snowing.
What are you going to do with this money?
My father made a shelf for me.
What's the secret ingredient?
Did you order something?
He is reading a book.
Trains are running on schedule.
That tickles.
The excited audience ran into the concert hall.
Let's eat sushi.
What did you come here for?
I'm looking forward to it.
Put the book on the top shelf.
Don't shout like that. I can hear you perfectly.
They lived happily ever after.
I have a bad pain here.
He came to see me.
I didn't buy anything at the duty-free shops.
He did not get up early.
Is it getting cold outside?
Why is fish so expensive?
Take good care of yourself.
"If I had more money, I would move to a bigger house."
Would you like something to drink?
Tom is in London on business now.
Turn the radio down a little.
My son is taller than me.
I'll be back soon.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I can't describe my feelings.
I saw Tom get out of the taxi.
What's your favorite piece of music?
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Who's this guy?
He thinks of everything in terms of money.
He took out his passport.
I wish I could live in a house that nice.
There's little hope of Tom getting well soon.
It isn't necessarily so.
Is it still far from here?
I wonder how Tom is doing.
The mayor addressed the general public.
You should obey your parents.
Keep your chin up.
Tom was in his pajamas.
I have seen that girl before.
Close all the doors and windows.
He's now short of money.
She is always busy.
Don't put the chair there.
It's the only one there is in the shop.
Tom has started dating an older woman.
Were you sleeping?
The waitress set a glass of juice in front of me.
Tom was only wearing a towel.
I prefer going out to staying home.
I couldn't anticipate that would happen.
That singer is very popular with young people.
Speak quietly.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
We'll meet at the station at 2:30.
He left immediately.
The earth is like a ball with a big magnet in it.
We checked in at the hotel at three.
Your garden needs some attention.
He made a clean break with them.
"I was going out, when the telephone rang."
I like watching planes take off.
Everyone laughed.
I think it's around here.
Cut the cake with this knife.
He's well built.
Tom wants to read a book.
Do you have any part-time work?
It has been ten years since I left Japan.
How did the interview go?
I know Tom can't understand French.
I'm hungry.
He has three children.
I found the book interesting.
They have to repair their car.
Quit acting like a child.
"When I opened the door of the refrigerator, an apple fell out."
Tom despises Mary.
She is kind.
Ask your question.
Bring the laundry in.
I'm very thirsty.
Don't pry into the affairs of others.
Playing cards is fun.
I had a bad headache. That's why I went to bed early.
We lost sight of the UFO right away.
The roof leaks every time it rains.
I'm very sorry to hear it.
Try once again.
How about adding a touch of pepper?
"When I woke up this morning, it was raining hard."
I didn't know Tom had a sense of humor.
Please help yourself to the cake.
Keep the door open.
I still haven't decided who I'm voting for.
Leave this house.
The car is acting up again.
The gap between them has narrowed.
Don't panic.
I think Tom is OK.
She said that she would follow him no matter where he went.
I could say nothing in my dad's presence.
I had my watch stolen.
"Another bottle of wine, please."
Tom often puts honey in his tea instead of sugar.
I can't drink any more.
Is this the place where your mother works?
You're very patient.
I bought flowers because my grandmother is coming today for a visit.
She wore a sad expression.
"Tom, I have something to tell you."
I would like to have my teeth straightened.
I have nothing in particular to say about this problem.
The sheets feel damp.
"Tom, too, likes Mary."
Turn right at the light.
I am going to stay here for a couple of days.
French is difficult.
Is that a cat or a dog?
My father and my brother work at that factory.
We all know where you live.
Only one person survived the accident.
I put my finger to my lips.
Take your hands out of your pockets.
"Could you pass me the pepper, please?"
The truck dumped the sand on the ground.
Your beard makes you look old.
I would also like to rent a car.
How did you meet?
Have a good Christmas.
I have a friend who is a pilot.
Calm down.
Tom usually speaks French.
The boys played cops and robbers.
We have a factory in Boston.
What is in the box?
What is your name?
He ran five miles.
My father has just come home.
I'm pretty sure Tom's bald.
Can you sing this song?
Old people are inclined to look back on the past.
Have you ever ridden in a sports car?
You may as well stay where you are.
He countered their proposal with a surprising suggestion.
Do you need the car?
You have come at an opportune time.
I inherited my father's property.
Everybody knows that he lost his leg in the war.
Tom was always different from other children.
He acquired Russian quickly.
Yesterday I was on my way home from work when I ran smack into my old girlfriend.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
"You're not leaving Japan for good, are you?"
A bad cold has kept me from studying this week.
"Mary. ""What?"" ""Do you have a boyfriend?"" ""Why do you ask?"""
Forgive me for being late.
This chair is ugly.
This bird cannot fly.
Tom worked in Boston.
I have some money.
What I said was just a guess.
I want to work in a factory.
I'm not the kind of idiot who would climb a mountain in the winter without proper preparations.
I can see why Tom likes Mary.
Did you receive the letter?
We have to clear up the problem first.
I advise you to give up drinking.
It's made of leather.
The water's 38 degrees.
I want to be alone for a while.
She smokes a lot.
Let's buy some apples.
Put down your pencils.
We are brother and sister.
An old man came along.
The stewardess can speak French after a fashion.
Do you have the same thing in a different color?
I wish that I didn't have to tell you this.
Five fire engines rushed to the scene of the fire.
Is there anything that I can do to help you?
"Tom, your mom's here."
Let us know if you're available next week.
The waves swallowed up the boat.
She has two cats. One is white and the other one is black.
He hardly works.
Are you pregnant?
Tom wanted to visit America.
She died yesterday afternoon.
It's been three years since my father died.
Tom is doing laundry.
It's a rather interesting project.
Please come in.
"I'm right, aren't I?"
He's used to speaking in public.
Tom is more than just a friend.
Be sure not to eat too much.
Did you burn yourself?
Let's take a short cut.
The restrooms are on the left.
Try it again.
I object to her going there alone.
You can't miss it.
He's a Japanese boy.
I don't know anything about what happened.
The financial situation is getting worse week by week.
I was caught in a shower.
"You know you have to do that, right?"
Tom worked hard to achieve his goals.
I want a boiled egg.
I have a lot of things to do today.
He gave in to the temptation.
Your face is dirty.
We studied French at school.
Many friends saw him off.
That's pretty good.
You always reserve the same room.
I want this one and that one.
Whales are classified as mammals.
He is unsociable.
Tom couldn't eat for three days.
It was nobody's fault.
I intend to study abroad next year.
Did you do your homework?
"Thanks for your help. ""It was nothing."""
I'm all right.
He will join us later.
He decided to submit his resignation.
Tom replied that he was sorry.
Are you under any stress?
Open your mouth wide.
I didn't think it would cost this much.
The old lady has been rather feeble since her illness.
I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
What are you worrying about?
I'm sure Tom will help us.
We're next.
Look at the girl over there.
I cannot help laughing at her jokes.
He dropped his books on the floor.
The news of the accident was a great shock to me.
She tapped the box with her forefinger.
I don't need a lawyer.
I'm going to talk to Tom when he comes home.
Now let's go.
I grow tomatoes and onions in my garden.
Is there any place special you want to go?
Can I borrow $30?
It is certain that he is wrong.
He came home dead tired.
I've never thought about becoming a teacher.
The quiz was very easy.
"Could you pass me the pepper, please?"
We'll go on a picnic if it's fine tomorrow.
The strike affected the nation's economy.
It'll soon be three o'clock.
The church is just across the street.
We watched the baseball game on TV last night.
"I don't want to get married, but I want to have kids."
Be a good kid.
Could you please make room for me?
It's nice and cool here.
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
I want bread and jam.
Are you allergic to any foods?
Why do you want to become a lawyer?
Tom rarely laughs.
What did you choose?
It was a trap.
I agree.
Tom is well.
My father likes traveling by air.
I locked the front door.
Everyone calmed down.
She is making progress with her English.
He and I are classmates.
What was your first impression of me?
Tom was completely exhausted.
Butterflies are pretty.
You need to attach your photo to the application form.
I’m happy to help if you’d like.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
Mary drank three cups of coffee before she left for work.
I don't know because I wasn't there.
Please tell me what I should do.
I should not have said that.
Tom and Mary said they could speak French.
I can't let you do that.
Can I talk to Tom?
It's already 7 o'clock.
I'm eighteen.
The teacher recommended that I read Shakespeare.
The solution was quite simple.
Tom lives next door to me.
I'm sick of eating fish.
I quite agree with you.
Is there any chance Tom will get arrested?
I'll drive you home.
It's time to leave.
Will it rain this afternoon?
She rode a camel.
My parents are still young.
The speaker cleared his throat.
My children try hard to get up early.
We often played chess after school.
My parents send you their best regards.
Why does this always happen to me?
Please hand in the report by the end of the month.
You were late for work.
I'm very sorry I got home so late.
The heat is terrible today.
I'm busy now.
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.
It's 2:00 p.m.
I hardly ever walk to work.
The mother of that child is an announcer.
The children were skinny dipping.
Tom burned all of the letters that Mary sent him.
He hid his sadness behind a smile.
Is it too early to start drinking?
Do you have any idea how many people died when the Titanic sunk?
I escaped the accident by the skin of my teeth.
I'm taking tomorrow morning off from work.
We go camping every summer.
"Tom ordered apple pie, and so did I."
"When Dad came home, I was watching TV."
I wonder what has become of his sister.
Don't break the branches.
There's the bell.
She made him do it.
Stay calm.
I can't ride a bike.
I am on our high school soccer team.
Where is the meeting room?
Do I need to reconfirm?
School begins on the eighth of April.
How long is this?
I called my girlfriend.
Columbus discovered America in 1492.
Tom's somewhere in the park.
Make yourself at home.
I prefer coffee to tea.
It was a baseless rumor.
He's very sick.
He's as talkative as ever.
I replied automatically when I heard my name.
I promise I won't bite.
"You don't like me much, do you?"
Could you please show me your passport?
Tom sounded happy.
The prices are subject to change without notice.
He decided to put off his departure.
"It is very hot in this room, isn't it?"
He gave an explanation about why he had been absent.
He loses his temper easily.
Tom sat on the bench.
He will be playing tennis tomorrow afternoon.
He is our teacher of English.
Don't move from here.
"If it had not been for the storm, I would have arrived earlier."
I have a lot of work to get through today.
I love elderberry juice.
Get up at seven tomorrow morning.
There's enough water.
You're disgusting.
You must not go out after dinner.
The baby was in a deep sleep in his mother's arms.
Am I going to need surgery?
"I thought I would be nervous, but I was cool as a cucumber."
It won't open.
I don't remember what I ate because I was on my phone while I was eating.
"Tom likes fishing, doesn't he?"
"She's asleep now, isn't she?"
Mary is wearing provocative clothing.
That's what I said all along.
Few people seem to have read the book.
Would you like to go out for coffee?
You have good reason to be angry.
I have been to the station to see him off.
I've decided to tell Tom that I like him.
I need to go to the store to buy some eggs.
I was in London most of the summer.
I am deeply ashamed.
She is no match for me.
I don't want anything to eat.
I promise I won't be late tomorrow.
I wonder whether Tom is able to understand French.
I decided to become a lawyer.
There are three tables in the storeroom.
"Excuse me, but may I use your telephone?"
I hope you enjoy the concert.
Please air the room.
It looks like it's going to snow.
Let Tom in.
Tom is agile.
After ten minutes' walk we came to the museum.
A sponge absorbs water.
Tom sent Mary money.
I wanted to get drunk.
The bride looked very beautiful.
We have five English lessons a week.
I don't like him because he loses his temper easily.
Let's split this fifty-fifty.
I told Tom that I would do my best.
Could I please have a subway map?
The refugees struggled against hunger.
"We aren't really on the same page with what we're talking about, are we?"
I have ten pens.
The prisoner was given his freedom.
Don't you watch the news?
My parents don't want me to get married.
That's a good idea.
I'm a private language teacher.
He lay down on the bed.
How lucky! There's nothing broken.
I thought that you didn't believe in ghosts.
He is looked up to as a leader.
What are you planning on making for dinner?
Take off your hat when you enter a temple.
"Tom, who had been working all day, wanted to have a rest."
Tom went to Boston the day after Thanksgiving.
Why don't you go take a shower?
"I had no more than 1,000 yen."
"When I got up today, my throat felt a little sore."
Definitely!
Tom got hit by a truck.
The red sweater is more expensive than the blue one.
Where do you get on the bus every day?
The meeting was held last month.
It is just five o'clock.
Turn the radio on.
How's Tom doing?
My mind was blank.
These boxes are made of plastic.
I can't see that far.
You shouldn't rely on other people's help.
I visited Boston with Tom.
The soldiers opened fire.
I made friends with him.
I really like swimming.
How long did it take you to get to Boston by plane?
The TV is broken.
We can't see the view because of these trees.
Are you in?
"You don't need to apologize, Tom."
Does she speak English?
There's nothing wrong.
My dog is not so big.
"Excuse me, is there a cash machine near here?"
Where's the morning paper?
Please speak a little more slowly.
"I thought a bunch of people would go water skiing with us, but absolutely no one else showed up."
I can't walk any further.
You'd better have your hair cut at once.
Tom is coming right back.
The question is whether or not my parents will agree.
It's quiet here at night.
Both of the answers are incorrect.
I want to save money.
Is it OK if I speak with you?
Are you going to help me with this?
Where's your school?
Is it true that Tom and Mary are dating?
Tom's house burned to the ground.
I caught a bad cold last week.
I quit smoking.
I wonder if it'll be fine tomorrow.
I'll write you back soon.
Tom retired when he was 65.
I like mushrooms.
Ask me whenever you're in doubt.
I might not go swimming today.
I was laughed at at school today.
The company has decided to sell some of its money-losing units.
Tom isn't as young as Mary.
May I swim in the lake?
Do you think that eating with your family is important?
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
That's exactly what I mean.
Tom lay on his back.
Where did you go?
Not all of the staff was present.
That student sometimes pretends to be sick.
Sometimes I work on holidays.
Would Tom be better off without Mary?
Are you guys really OK?
Maybe we were too optimistic.
Look at my new car.
I had a narrow escape.
An old woman is walking across the road.
We were together.
What does that sign say?
I seem to have a temperature.
I saw a documentary about it.
"Excuse me, where's the subway station?"
My friend will be our guide.
I'll tell you if you promise me you won't get mad.
Tom wasn't wearing a blue sweater.
I can't trust such a man.
I came to Japan from China.
They might have to cancel the flight because of the typhoon.
She solved the puzzle with ease.
Why didn't you go to the office?
I cannot help but sympathize with him any time I see him.
Was that man harassing you?
"If I were you, I'd follow his advice."
It's still too cold to go to the beach.
Tom asked me if I knew Mary's telephone number.
"I don't know when, but it'll happen someday."
The results for the English exam this time were very good.
Why am I always the one who has to suffer?
I've got to go.
Did you call mom?
I think I had chickenpox as a child.
Tom thinks that he can trust Mary not to do something stupid.
We could live in peace here.
"As soon as I got home, the telephone rang."
"Boston is very far, isn't it?"
Give me something to write on.
I made a note of the telephone number.
Hurry up or you'll miss the train.
What color is this?
I thought we were going out to dinner.
He chose to live in Tokyo instead of Osaka.
We didn't get much snow last year.
I dreamt you were eating fish.
When did Tom start doing that?
Where are you moving to?
She was on the verge of killing herself.
Take a look at this map.
I'm sorry I'm unable to attend your party.
What did Tom say?
You think too much.
Have a nice vacation.
I felt out of place in the expensive restaurant.
Would you sew a button on my shirt?
Is that bike Tom's?
Swimming is fun for me.
Are you in trouble?
Tom became depressed.
He knows nothing about politics.
I'm not a specialist.
He fell in love with her at first sight.
He had a lot of money in the bank.
The cat likes to sleep beside me.
We have too many classes.
You don't have to wrap it up.
Is Boston bigger than Chicago?
Many Republicans didn't vote for their own candidate.
He shot himself this morning.
Is it OK if I take a break?
"She's at work, isn't she?"
How about going steady with me?
All the lights went out.
He bent over to see insects in the flowerbed.
It must've slipped my mind.
How perceptive!
It is no use asking him again.
Would you like to drink anything?
Watch yourself.
"If you don't hurry, you'll be late."
Haven't you eaten lunch yet?
Tom filled the bathtub with water.
Tom is baking bread.
The sweet potato is native to South America.
I don't need a tissue.
What are you driving at?
February is the shortest month.
I like the sun.
Why don't we buy a baseball glove for Tom?
Can you tell me your past medical history?
Why are you yawning?
I don't like Tom's new hat.
That island is American territory.
Both work and play are important.
It's going to clear up soon.
There were at least 100 people present.
What about next Sunday?
Everyone is hungry.
I am dying for a cold drink.
Someone has taken my shoes by mistake.
Let's go to the kitchen. I’ll make us some coffee.
I have had a corn removed from my foot.
An earthquake can happen at any time.
The rain made me late.
He must be aware of the danger.
Is your mother at home?
I thought you wanted this.
Let's slow down a bit.
He is nasty.
Just put it down here.
I'd really like to watch that movie.
Where's the nearest phone booth?
Tom refused to admit that he'd made a mistake.
I've just finished lunch.
France borders Italy.
I heard that they discovered the footprints of an abominable snowman in the Himalayan mountains.
"Mary is invited, isn't she?"
We have a lot to discuss.
Tom hates dogs.
You aren't kids anymore.
Can you explain it more clearly?
Trial and error is essential to progress.
I was a butterfly in my dream.
Her stern look got him to quit talking.
It's made of leather.
Is there anything you want to eat?
Do you have a seven-yen stamp?
"Hold on a minute, please."
She helped the old man cross the road.
Some people are killing time relaxing on park benches.
Tom's girlfriend's name isn't Mary.
"Long time, no see."
I've never been to Paris.
Can you eat raw oysters?
Which tie do you like most?
This is easy.
I like playing the piano.
The enemy flung fresh troops into the battle.
A fire broke out near my house.
Did you eat something last night?
I converted the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius in my head.
Look at that koala over there.
Do you really want to wear that?
You can't be here.
"Tom did study, but he didn't study very much."
Please stop crying.
Do you have money?
Where is the bathroom?
I beg your pardon?
Is this valuable?
What time will the game start?
My uncle has lived in Paris for ten years.
I asked Tom about that.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
Tom is drunk now.
How many students are there in your class?
Could I borrow an umbrella?
She came to Tokyo when she was 18.
I got here before you.
"Well, have you decided?"
Leave my camera alone.
When are you going shopping?
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
I can't do any more than this.
I think I ate too much chocolate.
They moved in recently.
He's almost as tall as me.
I'll go no matter what.
Mary giggled.
Do you have any further questions?
I had a phone call from him.
It was great to see Tom again.
When are you expecting?
Please give me a cup of coffee.
Tom also speaks French.
"When Tom was young, he ate three eggs every day."
I catch up with my reading on rainy days.
A lot of students do part-time jobs.
We studied English.
"You love your father, don't you?"
I played soccer today.
Is French difficult to learn?
You guys can do it if you try.
I have nothing to tell you about it.
Could you please tell me how to spell your name?
Did that accident really happen last year?
I'll say no more.
What does it cost?
Why did Tom accuse you?
That's a surprise.
The freedom of the press should not be interfered with.
Can you make sense of this poem?
Why did you buy the same camera I have?
What's that in your pocket?
He came in through the window.
Tom told me nothing.
"Thank you very much, doctor."
He's the tallest one in the class.
I can speak a little.
Sales have been increasing recently.
I didn't miss my wallet until I got home.

Where are you going on vacation?
How about a bite?
"I tried again and again, but I couldn't succeed."
What I wanted was water.
"Last night, I ate some asparagus and ham at my friend's house."
You don't look Japanese.
I can't even find time to read.
I got a C in English.
I highly recommend this movie.
I noticed.
How long will this rope hold?
Tom's apartment looks great after he had it re-carpeted.
Tom turned off the light.
He's sharp-witted.
She hung up in silence.
I advised him to be independent of his parents.
Tom was all alone in the house.
Yesterday my father caught three fish.
It's too dark to play tennis.
Tom was fearless.
I take care of Tom.
The front door of the house was open.
She was afraid of the dog.
She did not come down until 8:00.
Tom tried opening the door.
Both Tom and Mary were absent today.
Tom never drinks beer at home.
What Tom is saying is certainly reasonable.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
I'm on the roof now.
My cousin is the second to the last person in the line.
Where should we eat tonight?
I almost threw up.
I need first aid.
Tom said he thought he heard voices in the next room.
"A piano is expensive, but a car is even more expensive."
Have you taken your medicine?
Did you lock your suitcase?
"Take off your socks, please."
Tom and Mary lived in Boston for a time.
"I went to bed, but I couldn't fall asleep."
Tom finally quit smoking.
"From the look of the sky, it may begin to snow tonight."
Come whenever you want.
Tom often plays tennis with Mary after school.
Do you like gardening?
I must manage on a small income.
Thank you for everything you've done for me.
Don't talk back to me.
I watched a tennis match on TV.
I think we should go.
May I visit your office tomorrow morning?
I haven't seen Tom in months.
Tom and Mary walked home together.
Do you know what PKO stands for?
"Whenever I hear that song, I think of my childhood."
I can't dance either.

That's a good plan.
They grow oranges in California.
That movie was amazing.
Tom's dog is brown.
I'm counting the number of people.
I have a headache.
What's this sound?
This is a souvenir from Australia.
It was so cold that I stayed at home all day.
I hope that he will succeed.
They killed a goat as a sacrifice to God.
Could you drop me off at the library?
Don't you think we can win?
Tom spent the night in his van.
I can't believe you lied to me.
Please enter your PIN.
Tom and Mary both have bicycles.
Share your experience.
I already did it.
I wonder whether or not Tom will be late.
We know that that's not true.
Let's leave as soon as he arrives.
The line is busy now. Please hold the line.
"I'd never say this, but I can understand the intended meaning."
"Could I have the bill, please?"
I had a terrible accident riding this bike.
I'm not drunk yet.
Everything is all arranged.
Is it safe to eat this?
The meeting is held annually.
Tom can do this work alone.
Is the window open?
"No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't please him."
"It's very interesting, isn't it?"
The baby is still sleeping.
You look better with short hair.
Did you do that for Tom?
Can I come in?
"He turned the bottle upside down and shook it, but still the honey wouldn't come out."

What do you recommend?

Don't forget the ticket.
Tom has come to help.
Who taught them table manners?
Lake Biwa is the largest lake in Japan.
I was interviewed for a job.
Why are you so smart?
Asking questions is the best way to learn.
The rain prevented me from coming.
That girl can't ride a bicycle.
We did it!
Little did he know what was going on behind his back.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
Would you like a drink?
Turn up the radio a little bit.
What's happened?
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
It would be great if we could meet again.
That's all.
The stamp fell off the envelope.
They are both good teachers.
I'll mail you the book.
"There were no customers, so we closed the shop early."
Why did you quit?
I've been waiting for you since two o'clock.
There must have been an accident up ahead.
I will answer within three days.
I avoid reading the news.
I've experienced the same thing.
I spent a lot of time studying French.
She came alone.
Do you like my friend?
Can I check my baggage here?
Tom is a graduate student.
These pearls look real.
A promise is a promise.
There's no proof.
You should travel alone.
"You're really full of curiosity, aren't you?"
We needed to learn French.
Are you busy Friday night?
Tom is three now.
I'd like to make reservations for dinner tomorrow.
"Tom didn't call you, did he?"
I don't have time this afternoon.
I wanted to go there.
I don't agree with you.
Please help yourself to some fruit.
He is an actor.
Did you kill Tom?
I was too tired to walk any more.
"If I were you, I wouldn't do it."
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary did that.
I hate carrots.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
Have you read it all?
How many years have you been married?
There's no point arguing about the matter.
Can we stay here until it stops raining?
"If you don't want to go, you don't have to."
Tom talks as if he knows everything.
You might have an accident.
Open your hand.
Tom planted some flowers in his yard.
There are five apples in the box.
Why don't you dine out with me for a change?
A child whose parents are dead is called an orphan.
Have you ever gone to Boston?
Tom is a funny person.
Which bicycle do you like?
I didn't mean that.
What did you come here so early for?
Really?
The man stood up.
I don't go in for that sort of thing.
It's hot in this room.
They sent for a doctor at once.
It's brand new.
Japanese should not forget that America is a multiracial nation.
You can't put it off any longer.

It's said that he knows the secret.
Are you idiots?
A puppy followed me wagging its tail.
I hate grammar.
You seem to have made considerable progress since I saw you last.
Tom isn't very shy.
She talked as she walked.
"Did you watch the video? ""Some of it."""
Tom doesn't believe in God.
You must never resort to violence.
I asked him if he was busy.
Tom wrapped his arms around Mary.
He decided to quit smoking.
Are you still upset?
Let's go to the movies.
We're right behind you.
A group of young men were fighting.
Tom is crying now.
We found out recently that some foxes live here on this mountain.
"Like father, like son."
Please come and see me at a time that's convenient for you.
Tom always does his homework before supper.
Everything that lives will die sometime.
What're you writing?
May I sit here?
I asked Tom to close the door.
"At this rate, we'll have to change the schedule."
Tom has been working as Mary's chauffeur for years.
Where are you right now?
It's too late to apologize.
I'm staying at my aunt's.
"Since it stopped raining, he went out for a walk."
I think we should reduce the prices.
I took out the trash while you were gone. You should thank me.
We'll walk.
What if it leaks?
I don't know where I should go.
I go to school by bus.
"If you eat that, you'll die."
The concert will take place next summer.
"Push the button, please."
We have a half-dozen eggs.
There's not much wind today.
Take a chance.
Don't even say that as a joke.
Brush your teeth after each meal.
We should know the result by Thursday.
Tom is not in.
Cats enjoy sunbathing.
He was very busy all day.
I don't love her anymore.
No one knows his address but Tom.
They demolished the old temple to build a skyscraper.
He is most likely to succeed.
We're all supposed to know the traffic rules.
What are the main sights around here?
I'm afraid not.
My throat is a little sore.
I wonder what ever will become of them.
I'll see you a week from today.
I think the wind's picking up.
I used to play with Tom.
"Tom, which do you prefer, girls with long hair or girls with short hair?"
"The sooner, the better."
She explained to me how to make a cake.
I'll come here again tomorrow.
He was shot to death.
I didn't feel cold.
Tom didn't open the door for me.
She said nothing that would make him angry.
Where are you all going so early in the morning?
The chicken laid an egg this morning.
The reason that Tom got sick was because he overate.
I'll wash my own dishes.
Tom's request is very reasonable.
Don't treat me like a child.
Can he speak English?

It's pretty wild.
I made a hole in the wall.
Never play here.
The old man left a large fortune to his wife.

Tom keeps an extra pair of shoes in the trunk of his car.
"I am a student, but he isn't."
Do we have class today?
I accepted a present from his sister.
"In general, men run faster than women."
A wise person wouldn't do something like that.
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.
I work for a trading company.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
She held up her head.
Tom locked the door.
Do you have a five-pound note?
Tom had a telephone call from Mary early this morning.
Why are you doing this to me?
Bad habits are hard to break.
I thought I'd never be happy again.
This house has eleven rooms.
This winter is warm.
It's not worth reading any further.
Watch out for pickpockets.
Are you a singer?
Tom took a nap on the sofa.
Just ask Tom.
Tom is traveling around Australia.
Where was the knife found?
I'm looking forward to your letter.
I'll put some salt on the meat.
We were all present at the meeting.
Tom lives on the third floor of this apartment building.
What time will we leave?
Tom has been sending Mary flowers.
"I couldn't drink both bottles, so I left one for you."
Summer vacation is soon.
I hope my mistake will escape his notice.
Tom handed Mary one of the drinks.
I gave money to everybody.
Please close the window.
I built this for you.
I really like opera.
I haven't spoken with anybody today.
I'm older than he is.
She achieved great success in her business.
After you.
I want my own shop.
The picture is true to life.
She's worked hard to save up money.
He regrets his mistake.
Please don't worry.
He asked for money.
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
I'm single.
I don't want to hear any excuses.
Has something happened between you and Tom?
We can deliver it this evening.
I can't afford to pay so much.
Tom isn't so tall.
Sit over there.
Anyone can make a mistake.
That's all I can say at the moment.
The answer was incorrect.
The Giants will be playing the Dragons tomorrow.
The summer vacation is only a week away.
They live on the other side of the road.
I stayed at a nice hotel.
"When the program finished, we switched the radio off."

Do you know when Tom will return?
Your shirt's on inside out.
Is Tom here?
Can you solve this problem?
I want to go to Australia some day.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
Tom earned money by playing his guitar on street corners.
I would rather go out.
She always looked happy.
My father smokes.
Where do you intend to go?
I got a flat tire.
It's necessary to avoid stress.
I like your room.
Just get up.
Items with a red price tag are on sale.
I don't have classes tomorrow afternoon.
Were there many people watching?
I think that Tom is wrong.
Let's see what Tom says.
You will do exactly as I say.
Where's my son?
I'll return the book to the library later.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
Tom likes Mary.
Only Tom saw it.
My father gives my mother all of his salary.
Tom and Mary said that they're glad that you're back.
Choose one person.
I don't have a bicycle.
Do you like these colors?
Which way did Tom go?
She taught me how to write a poem.
I'm on duty now.
I had a good sleep last night.
Tom has red hair and freckles.
"Once a bad habit is formed, it's hard to get rid of it."
The ship was flying the American flag.
I'm afraid that I'm not much of a cook.
I've always wanted to do this.
My father sat deep in meditation with his eyes closed.
I have beautiful legs.
It's fun to watch the race.
I wish I were a bird.
The lemon is a sour fruit.
Tom opened the door and walked in.
He is a teacher and novelist.
Are there many poisonous snakes in Australia?
Who wants to be cooped up indoors on a nice day like this?
Think carefully before you promise anything.
Take care of yourself.
I had a ball.
The door would not open.
I hope that she'll get well soon.
The post office is the brown building.
It wasn't worth the effort.
It's high time the children went to bed.
Please tell Tom I'm going to be a few minutes late.
Tom caught the fish with his bare hands.
We walked for two hours.
We kept in touch.
She was a genius in mathematics.
How much will it cost to get there by bus?
It's time for us to leave.
Stop staring at me like that.
I don't think Tom is available.
My father runs a restaurant.
Tom taught me how to read.
Is there a treatment?
The cause of the fire isn't known.
I'll be seventeen next year.
Tom might be getting fired.
I once lived in Rome.
What Tom said was beside the point.
Chickens and geese were walking around the yard.
I'll see you in Australia.
He finished it as quick as lightning.
Tom put on his rubber gloves.
He looked up at the night sky.
I have not been busy for two days.
I'm exhausted.
Are you good at keeping secrets?
"This is, strictly speaking, a mistake."
I could see nothing but fog.
She decided on a blue dress.
I coughed up blood.
This is a sentence that has the syllable count of a haiku.
Won't you come to my house next Sunday?
"When you were a child, did you have any friends?"
How many holes are there in a straw?
Tom was kind to the animals.
"I may have read that novel, but I don't remember it."
What gifts did you get for Christmas?
He is the tallest boy.
What a pain!
"You saw what happened, didn't you?"
Tom made me a bird cage.
"Won't you come with us? ""I'd be glad to."""
I went to the supermarket and bought a bag of rice.
We should go by train.
Tom made everyone laugh.
That looks somewhat dangerous.
My father hates the summer heat.
"I'm happy to be here, Tom."
I met your friend.
Do you think my way of teaching is wrong?
I used to visit my grandparents several times a month when I was a kid.
Tom tried to sell the camera he'd stolen.
I know it very well.
This class is already full.
"Which do you prefer, spring or autumn?"
I saw some monkeys climbing the tree.
There is no place like home.
I gave an opening address.
It suddenly got cold.
Tom encouraged Mary to buy a hybrid car.
I passed out.
"It rained heavily, so the playground is muddy."
Tom was a real hero.
I can't stand that nasty attitude of his any longer.
He named his puppy Pooch.
I bought a pair of shoes.
Who did Tom eat with?
I forgot the lyrics.
Tom works hard.
Stay in bed.
I worked hard all day long yesterday.
I have recovered from my bad cold.
Tom has been working too hard.
Tom can run pretty fast.
School starts at eight in the morning.
"This camera is small, but very good."
It made her jealous to see him walking with another girl.
My father is away from home.
"It's cold, isn't it?"
They're jealous.
Where's the bathroom?
This is great.
Don't get your hopes up too much.
I wouldn't recommend reading this book.
You don't have to work today.
Tom doesn't know where Mary lives.
I haven't downloaded the file yet.
Let's play hide-and-seek.
He believes that there is a spy among us.
We demanded that he explain to us why he was late.
I'm feeling fit.
Come inside because it's cold outside.
She decided to get married to Tom.
I'll go to Kyoto.
Who wrote this letter?
Tom knows more.
Tom can't play tennis.
I have gray hair.
It will be three months before our house is completed.
Don't forget to brush your teeth before going to bed.
It's too expensive.
"I only met Tom three weeks ago, but I think we'll be great friends."
Edison invented the lightbulb.
The audience roared with laughter.
There was no one in the room.
That's a good idea.
Tom is 30 years old.
Is there any need for me to go there?
The problem is difficult to solve.
I had a dream last night.
Could you take our picture?
Tom has an impeccable alibi.
That's their problem.
Tom and Mary held hands as they watched the fog roll in.
The two companies are competing with each other.
"Any time you want to borrow my car, all you have to do is ask."
She is attractive.
I don't feel like going out this morning.
What did Tom go there to do?
"Sorry, I don't understand French."
This isn't good.
You won't regret it.
We took turns driving.
How long have you been playing the violin?
"I have been waiting for your reply, but have not heard from you."
The day we arrived was a holiday.
Is it OK if I change the channel?
"I want to buy a drone, but my parents won't let me."
Just go about your business and don't keep looking at me.
It isn't easy to write a love letter.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Tom is the only one who's able to do that.
Is there anything else you want to know?
That's my house.
Pardon me for interrupting.
That experiment was a failure.
This font is hard to read.
Not a single person was on the street.
No need to worry.
Give me a call later.
Where is the hotel?
The problem is not settled yet.
"I looked around, but saw nothing."
Just tell me what you're looking for.
I had no choice but to have my left leg amputated.
"Not knowing what to do, I called my mother for advice."
Let's take a break.
Children are curious about everything.
You shouldn't have killed Tom.
Every house in the town was empty.
Tom has to take medicine every three hours.
Man is the only animal that writes books.
"If I had enough money, I could buy it."
The train was packed.
I haven't yet watched the video.
This building looks very futuristic.
You aren't supposed to swim here.
I've already called.
The price of books is getting higher these days.
I can't start up my computer. What am I supposed to do?
Tom was a pretty good basketball player in high school.
Keep in touch!
She is always neat and tidy.
I'm proud of my brother.
I completely agree.
Tom's life's in danger.
I'm going to Hawaii by ship.
Tom said the plan wasn't good enough.
I can't speak French very well.
I know all about you.
She is easygoing.
I think it's true.
I didn't leave my house yesterday.
You should keep trying for the time being.
"All of a sudden, he proposed to me."
That kind of story appeals to me.
I finally have time to reply to the mail that I have received these past three weeks.
Come with me.
I always mute my phone.
Hang on.
I'm anxious about his safety.
I stole it from Tom.
Why are you looking so sad?
We'll have a barbecue at the beach.
You're allowed to go.
I ate leftovers for lunch.
I never wanted to get a divorce.
This sounds interesting.
May I turn the radio off?
I don't like sports.
You shouldn't give the same weight to opinions as you give to facts.
I love cherry blossom season.
"Mary had a cold, so she stayed in bed."
Tom is probably angry.
It's a serious problem.
Why don't you give your mouth a rest?
Tom has been studying French for the last three years.
I'm now in Boston.
Today there were no visitors.
Does your head still hurt?
Some of my friends can speak English well.
Is there no alternative?
May I use your car today?
We caught a big one there.
Three times four is twelve.
This book will do.
"You're single, right?"
"When I grow up, I want to be a politician."
Was anyone surprised?
Please clap.
What are you good at?
Can you keep an eye on the pasta?
That's the building where my father works.
They kept talking even though I asked them to stop.
Tom wants to learn how to ride a bicycle.
I want to go to Boston at least one more time before I die.
I don't feel like joking.
"In those days, music was everything to us."
I know how to add numbers on an abacus.
How did you come to know her?
Open the bottle.
"You don't look like each other. ""That's because we're fraternal twins."""
I have no kids.
"Shut the door, please."
Does it hurt when I do this?
Please don't go.
I ate late last night.
What'd you say?
Don't let him know her address.
He let the dog loose in the yard.
"If it were not for water and salt, we could not live."
Don't use the desk by that window.
He seemed to have been ill.
There are many fish in this lake.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
Don't worry so much.
"Human beings, whether they realize it or not, continually seek happiness."
Are you studying chemistry?
It isn't easy to teach French.
I plan on going there.
I'm in my office.
Phone me as soon as you get there.
Did you really think I'd help you?
It doesn't sound too bad to me.
I took it back to the inn.
"Sign at the bottom, please."
I'm going to solve the problem.
I don't know what Tom thought.
I'm thinking of buying a new house.
How much is that?
I couldn't hear what Tom was saying.
I arrived there too early.
I was just about to go out when it started raining.
She is collecting material for a book.
Sleep is the best medicine.
They held a special session on trade problems.
I'm still a beginner.
I know an ideal place for a party.
The children chased after the circus parade.
"It looks like it's going to be hot today, too."
We had a math test today.
Is it true Tom got arrested?
I ate a hamburger.
Why is everyone speaking so quietly?
Tom was a witness to the accident.
The park benches were all occupied.
A bear will not touch a dead body.
Do you really believe it?
I took the job without giving it much thought.
You have to go.
I want to go to Australia once more before my passport expires.
Is that a common name?
Mary is Tom's wife.
Were they with you?
Do you know who killed Tom?
Do you know where I am?
I would rather die than do it.
Tom can't be that bad.
The only language Tom can speak is French.
Give me a day or two.
I just want your love.
We're staying at our uncle's.
I don't like waiting.
May I use your car today?
Why on earth did you sell your newly-built house?
I wonder whether Tom has seen this movie.
This is a worthwhile book.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
He didn't attend the meeting.
How did you come by the money?
Why is your mouth so big?
You must not smoke while working.
He devoted his life to his study.
She fooled him.
I know the ropes.
Have you heard from him recently?
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
Tom doesn't have a smartphone.
I reflected on the problem.
Everyone is friendly to her.
I want to get my ears pierced.
Tom sang the song I requested.
Someone has stolen my money.
My nose is stuffed up.
Tell me when you're ready.
Pneumonia causes difficulty in breathing.
Is Tom asleep?
I didn't eat dinner last night.
Just keep on walking.
Everything is all right at home.
The dog chased the rabbit.
The boy rowing the boat is a friend of mine.
I get off at the next station.
I'm a good-for-nothing bum.
It worked.
Do come by all means.
Mary is a beauty.
Promise me you won't make fun of me.
I met a young man whose name was Tom.
It happened last week.
"I knocked on the door, but there was no answer."
I can't think of anybody else.
Have you completed your homework?
I want something to write on.
"After I got married, my Japanese got better and I could understand more."
I believe you.
"Coffee, please."
When will you come home?
Speaking English is difficult.
This dictionary is my sister's.
I wish I had seen her.
Is it true that Tom joined a cult?
Tom bought a new horse.
My father has quit smoking for his health.
I just happened to be there at that time.
We even heard planes.
Please hold on to the strap.
Were you overweight?
I'll make a phone call.
Tom and Mary used to often eat lunch together.
"I, too, am worried about Tom."
I am looking forward to the trip.
It is a very pleasant day today.
I do work related to computers.
Do you know where he lives?
It's October the third.
Tom said it probably wouldn't take that long.
Do you promise not to tell anyone anything?
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
I translated the contract into French.
"Hey, that's a good idea."
Tom doesn't like you.
I arrived just in time for the plane.
I have to go alone.
How many kilos did Tom lose last summer?
I don't want to be a teacher.
I love Boston.
Tom often dreams about his girlfriend.
Tom didn't tell Mary about what had happened.
Show it again.
I promise not to tell Tom.
Have you got a match?
He's deeply in debt now.
A crowd gathered at the scene of the crime.
Tom is by no means unintelligent. He is just lazy.
There's a pencil on my desk you can use.
Mary put some flowers in the vase.
The weather is perfect for a picnic.
Cheers!
"If you hadn't had advice, you'd have failed."
We did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time.
There's a good chance that he'll come.
"Come to think of it, I haven't chewed gum in years."
Where is your school?
There's no use crying.
What's your wife's job?
Tom has a part-time job after school.
The Japanese have a lot in common with the Chinese.
Tom and Mary live in a treehouse.
I left my umbrella on the train.
Tom studies French about three hours every day.

I only ate one granola bar.
Call me when you're ready.
It's because I love you.
What do you usually eat for lunch?
They were waiting for me at home.
Tom always kisses Mary good morning.
This room isn't all that large.
Tom is here.
What do you do when you're not working?
Do you know both of Tom's brothers?
I'll take this one.
I knew you would come.
My family are all early risers.
Are you writing a letter?
What country are you from?
We spent the day in the open air.
He died of old age two years ago.
Are you sure you want to do this?
It's too high in calories.
The wind is blowing from the east.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
There is a desk in a corner of the room.
Tom kicked Mary hard.
That is mine.
Please answer this question for me.
No way!
All the eggs in the box were broken.
I took my little sister by the hand when we crossed the street.
I looked it over once more.
That store sells newspapers and magazines.
She's an alcoholic.
We are in favor of your plan.
Tom went to the corner store to buy milk.
I went to the lawyer for legal help.
I feel lethargic.
Tom never talks about his work.
What kind of places would you like to see?
Everything's fine.
Tom was sleeping.
Show yourself.
It wasn't Tom's voice.
Where did you find this wallet?
Do you have a cheaper room?
It must've rained during the night.
Whose book is that?
"If you don't take a vacation, you'll collapse."
I can't help thinking that my son is still alive.
The tickets for the concert are on sale here.
Take your coat off.
I wish you had told me the truth then.
That's surprising.
You have to allow for the boy's age.
Don't forget to count me in.
I'm glad it's not coming out of my pocket.
This toothbrush is too soft.
I am terribly hungry.
You may be right about that.
"Did he write a letter yesterday? ""Yes, he did."""
Don't be late for school.
I closed my eyes to calm down.
I agree with you.
I translated the document into French.
"You do that every Monday, don't you?"
Everybody is equal before the law.
The sky is very cloudy today.
They fell in love the moment their eyes met.
Everyone is responsible for his own actions.
There is no future in this job.
She lived there for years.
Tom looks shocked.
Are there any good malls around here?
We're sure of Tom's success.
This water isn't cold.
The picture is fuzzy.
Are Tom and Mary doing the same thing?
Tom thought Mary had a car.
I think that actions speak louder than words.
Show us how it works.
Where's Boston?
This mango is sweet.
She is learning how to drive a car.
Some people drink because they're lonely.
Do you need this?
The game has been postponed indefinitely.
The printer ran out of paper.
The ship went through the Panama Canal.
I don't want to go to the pool.
I think Tom can do that by himself.
We'll have to camp out if we can't find a place to stay.
She sent the letter by airmail.
Fermented foods like miso and natto are good for your health.
Tom wants to keep things the way they are.

This is a little vague.
He witnessed the murder.
Is reprinting this article a possibility?
He hit his head against a rock.
My father was in the navy.
Why do wine and cheese go together so well?
Tom lived downtown for three years.
My brother is stronger than me.
I don't understand the meaning of this word.
"Excuse me, how much does this cost?"
I don't want you to laugh at me.
Is everybody happy?
Mind your own business.
I watched an old movie on TV.
Say hello to your sister for me.
There are four seasons in a year.
I've seen better days.
Did you ride your bicycle yesterday?
"Tom, Mary and John were playing tag on the playground."
Please don't do that until Tom gets there.
I've learned a lot of things from Tom.
Please have a seat.
Have you ever traveled alone?
I see Tom.
It won't cost you anything.
We planted peanuts instead of cotton.
Tom speaks both French and English.
Do you like singing?
Tom woke up in the middle of the night.
Happy New Year!
My mirror broke.
I think that it's going to be a nice day.
You are always watching TV.
Let's make clear which is right and which is wrong.
It's a ten minutes walk to the bus stop.
I'll keep the fish alive.
You can't prove that.
Don't forget to return the book to the library.
I work every day but Sunday.
There's an old tower in the center of the village.
She switched on the lamp because it was dark.
He will come soon.
It was believed that whales were fish.
You're looking thin.
My arm is broken.
Tom didn't even look at the report that Mary gave him.
She'll have left before you come back.
I'd like to see her.
I wasn't surprised to see Tom at the concert.
What are they made of?
Do you still have a headache?
I take the subway almost every day.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I need some bread and milk.
There were a few children in the room.
I think you should keep those photos.
She warned him not to go out at night alone.
People living in town don't know the pleasures of country life.
Please do something.
"Feeling sick, he stayed home from school."
My brother is watching TV.
Our house isn't big.
Return to your work.
The fish was really delicious.
Recently I moved to another apartment.
There's a doghouse in the yard.
What's your favorite song to sing with young children?
"Have we met, by any chance?"
May I try it on again?
I borrowed the book from this library.
Whose pencil is this?
She disliked her husband.
Tom smokes.
I opened the window.
What do your friends call you?
I'll be seventeen next year.
I have a female cat.
It was a very good day.
You shouldn't talk back to your parents like that.
You can still do it if you want.
I wonder whether there'll be more snow this year than last year.
What kind of songs are popular these days?
I always wanted to go there.
He returned to Japan after graduating from college.
What a good scholar the author must be to write such a splendid book!
A person with average intelligence would understand that.
Tom and I are Mary's cousins.
Tom bought a new bathing suit.
Don't run here.
The accused was sentenced to death.
Didn't you go out?
It's quite apparent that you don't want to do this for me.
Where do you come from?
Have you heard from him?
Somebody help me.
He often sits for many hours reading books.
I'm extremely tired.
I'll go buy some bread.
The men cried for help.
I'm sleepy.
I go to bed about ten.
Tom bikes to work.
"Hurry up, or you'll be late for school."
I want to enjoy this moment.
The shaking finally stopped.
Tom works in a lab.
Could I have a drink?
You can't achieve anything without effort.
"Hey, look at this."
How did you like that movie?
I loosened my shoelaces.
You should eat breakfast.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is a vegetarian.
Which class are you in?
I think that that's a good idea.
That's an awfully fishy story.
I saw Tom at the dog park yesterday.
I can't draw.
Don't worry about it!
I thank you.
There isn't much to tell you.
Don't be long.
She's a dog.
He did his best.
He is hard to deal with.
There has always been war and there always will be.
You're supposed to be wearing your name tag.
I'm so sorry.
She has the habit of clearing her throat whenever she's nervous.
I want to hide under a rock.
The car is waxed and shining.
I thought you didn't want to be with me anymore.
This watch keeps accurate time.
Have you ever been to Australia in the spring?
She plays the piano very well.
What were you doing that moment?
He earns twenty dollars a day.
I don't usually have to work on Sundays.
I admit I was careless.
Are the flowers real?
Do you want this?
It was a lot of fun.
Spitting on streets is a crime in Singapore.
We're going to travel abroad this summer.
What's your favorite kind of cheese?
We should teach children how to protect themselves.
I always knew I couldn't do it.
I'm just warming up now.
This looks like a good place to pitch the tent.
Which is cheaper?
Where can I rent a bike?
I hope it helps.
The rivers were flooded by the heavy rain.
Every rose has its thorn.
I slept a little during lunch break because I was so tired.
Can I try this on?
What do you do?
"I understand the general approach, but I'm afraid that I'm getting bogged down in the details."
I've got time.
She promised to marry him.
She likes wine.
Where's the nearest subway station?
Tom heard some shots.
If only I had taken your advice.
"No matter what Tom does, he does it well."
How many books can I borrow?
I went to Disneyland with my mother.
That isn't what I'm looking for.
That village is the enemy's last stronghold.
Tom's dog isn't as big as mine.
Tom was a bit shorter than I was when we were in junior high school.
"Although it rained, everyone had a good time."
Let sleeping dogs lie.
I don't mind if the weather is hot.
He put the luggage down.
Don't let anybody leave this room.
"Sorry, I'm probably going to be about 20 minutes late."
Don't kill yourself.
We gave them everything we had.
"Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday."
How can you bear such a humiliation?
Give me a piece of chalk.
My uncle met with a traffic accident yesterday.
I feel homesick.
The trouble is that we have no money.
The sofa takes up too much room.
Both of us were very lucky.
The conference continued till 5 o'clock.
The old man spoke to me in French.
I've seen my dog sneeze but never my cat.
I watch TV now and then.
Many people were waiting in line.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
I assume that we're doing a pretty good job since no one has complained.
I feel like going out.
He's the oldest son.
I'll do this myself.
It's time to sleep.
I'm going to stay here for a couple of months.
Some of the balls are yellow.
I wanted to ask Tom how long he had lived in India.
I want to eat strawberries.
Tom is an arrogant jerk.
This game brings back memories.

Always have your dictionary close at hand.
He may have missed the train.
My grandfather gets up early.

That store is closed Mondays.
I'm just about ready.
I will meet you at the station at 10 p.m.
You can always count on me.
We must take into account the wishes of all the family in planning a trip.
I'll buy a ticket tomorrow.
When does your plane depart?
Will anybody be at the station to meet me?
That brown hat is old.
Tom and Mary were both dressed in black.
He hasn't answered my letter yet.
He promoted the idea of world government.
The song appealed to young people.
I pretended to be asleep.
I can't let you do that.
Let me explain.
Look at the mountains covered with snow.
Is that pure gold?
My boss made me work overtime.
She cried as she read the letter.
This is the current trend.
What are you selling?
It's the sort of work that calls for a high level of concentration.
Tom is going to be upset.
My trousers don't have pockets.
"The volcano erupted suddenly, killing many people."
When do you eat?
It took me a long time to get used to the noise.
He ate twice as much as I did.
I'll be back by seven or eight o'clock.
We need to develop a new kind of energy.
"If you make a promise, you should keep it."
You can go if you want to.
Tom is in his room now.
"You don't like gambling, do you?"
He's under treatment.
You may go ahead and open the window if you want to.

The truck hit a car.
May I use the toilet?
I don't like this kind of joke.
Who can run fastest in your class?
She was driven to stealing by hunger.
A cat came out from under the car.

"The opposite of ""heavy"" is ""light."""
I wonder whether it'll rain tomorrow.
Tom lived in Australia until a few years ago.
I was absent for a week.
He has two cats.
Come into my office.
That's the girl whose father is a doctor.
I am running short of money.
Do you remember what happened here in October of 2013?
You can stop now.
This is what I like about you.
Who do you plan to eat dinner with?
I lost my driver's license.
Where did I put the newspaper?
Taxi fares will go up next month.
I always go to school by bus.
My father died when the cherry blossoms were at their best.

There was nothing there.
These are the ruins of a castle.

"When Tom and Mary got married, he was 42 years old, and she was half his age. How old will Tom be when Mary reaches two-thirds his age?"
There used to be an old temple here.
Is it OK to trust Tom?
This chair is made of plastic.
I don't like such sports as boxing and hockey.
Tom hadn't eaten anything the whole day and was very hungry.
Do you want to go for a swim?
The child climbed to the top of the fir tree.
Can I talk with you for a minute?
I have to rinse my mouth out.
"Sorry, I've got my hands full now."
We agree.
Tom and Mary got married just three months after they first met each other.
The problems listed have already been fixed.
That's good enough for me.
Can you swim across this river?
I don't think it's that simple.
Tom can play piano very well.
It's difficult to live in this city.
I will gladly help you.
I feel like I've met her somewhere before.
It is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not.
This was more difficult than I thought it would be.
Is this book Tom's?
She doesn't believe in God.
Tom made Mary wash his car.
Is there a shuttle bus between the hotel and airport?
Where's the loo?
Are there any souvenir shops here?
"Tom did have a drinking problem for a while, but now he doesn't drink at all."
Have a nice weekend.
I don't like these kinds of jokes.
I'm sorry that I disappointed you.
I'm sure everyone will make it on time.
I work for a travel agency.
Who did you visit yesterday afternoon?
Get out of there immediately.
I swim once a week.
What were you guys doing then?
I'm a little bit nervous.
You may use it any time.
I'm a little tired.
You look like a cop.
"We're good friends now, but we didn't like each other at first."
Fever indicates sickness.
I'll eat here.
Everybody knows Tom likes Mary.
No country can match France's good quality wine.
Tom is still on his way to Boston.
I saw a movie for the first time in two years.
Each person has their own way of looking at the world.
I had a nap for about an hour.
My heart started racing.
I'm doing fine.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I went to the zoo.
I have no knowledge about their plans.
That was a huge success.
What time will you be leaving?
This is an automatic door.
Tom blew up the balloon.
Can you tell me your address?
He pinched and scraped for many years to save money.
The bus stopped suddenly.
"Last month, Tom went to Australia."
Is Tom dating someone?
She's out shopping for shoes.
Wow!
We lost our electricity because of the storm.
I ate too much food yesterday.
I stayed home this summer.
Is Tom a student here?
What time would be convenient for you?
I feel sleepy when I listen to soft music.
She looks down on people who are idle.
Crows are black.
"Two years ago, I couldn't play basketball at all."
Tom bought a very good camera.
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work.
I have to go back to work.
"If he sends me any letters, I just tear them up and throw them away."
There are many frogs in this pond.
Do you volunteer?
I know that Mary is more beautiful than I am.
She carried a baby on her back.
I'm not crying. I just have something in my eye.
Please bring me a cup of tea.
Tom won't eat anything I cook for him.
I feel dizzy.
I didn't use to smoke.
My watch is ten minutes fast.
How many different schools have you attended?
Tomorrow I'm going shopping.
There is no feeling in my toes at all.
Are you still not ready?
I'll come to your house later.
"It's simply that I don't really understand what an ""oddball"" is when said by a Mixi user."
Let's stop finding fault with each other.
We want it back.
Do you think Tom likes Mary?
Let's open it.
He'll succeed for sure.
"In Japan, we still sometimes see someone use an abacus, but not as often as we used to."
I want to eat something that isn't sweet.
This dictionary isn't useful at all.
What else do you remember?
The cat didn't move a muscle.
I want everybody to know that I'm not a murderer.
Could you tell me the way to the station?
He advised me to go there.
"Helen Keller was blind, deaf and mute."
"Seen at a distance, the rock looked like a human face."
Tom was thrown from his horse.
Which sports do you like?
Is it OK if I park here?
Do you like garlic bread?
What were you doing at that time?
Tom and I go to the same high school.
"As a boy, I used to lie on my back on the grass and look at white clouds."
Take your shoes off before going into a temple.
I'm feeling low.
I went to the station.
I'm staying with my uncle.
Please give my regards to your parents.
Please help yourself to the fruit.
Is there any rice left?
What is the bad news?
Tom asked me what I liked about Mary.
I have a kitty and a dog.
Someone stepped on my foot on the train.
Be careful not to trip.
Could you please drive me home?
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.
I don't agree with either of you.
I don't think Tom is at home.
How do you go to school every day?
Mary came out of the shower with a towel wrapped around her head.
Everybody spoke French.
"His car isn't here, so he must have gone."
We'll eventually know the truth.
Tom stole a police car.
Is Tom taller than Mary?
I don't want to lose this match.
I'd never seen that kind of fish until then.
Don't laugh at him for making a mistake.
Tom got to the station at 3:00.
Pick one of the two.
I'll get a hold of you.
Switch on the light. I can't see anything.
Please go into the room.
Did you know Tom was in Australia?
I have lost my cap.
I don't like her.
I want to sleep a little more.
Does everybody have a pencil?
The length of this ship is 30 meters.
Here comes the train.
I persuaded him to go to the party.
Let's eat.
That's absolute nonsense.
I think so.
Tom didn't sing the song we requested.
I recently broke up with my boyfriend of three years.
That girl's eyes are blue.
Don't sugarcoat it.
The result is neither good nor bad.
My cat likes to look out the window.
You must read between the lines.
Don't talk to us that way.
Are you working today?
Why did you tell Tom?
It's OK to leave the room now.
Why are you so sleepy?
The intersection where the accident happened is near here.
Do you know what's going on?
He has a habit of scratching his back and biting his nails.
My grandma stooped down and picked up a needle and thread.
Tom seems to like Boston.
My laptop is on the bed.
My daughter plays the violin well.
"Will you phone me later, please?"
I should've done something.
No one knows how to do that.
I lost my son about a decade ago.
Do you have any questions about the menu?
You don't have to tell the truth all the time.
Tom is in the kitchen.
Tom doesn't have to apologize to Mary.
I know that Tom lied.
Could you do me a favor?
How long have you been playing soccer?
"No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember that song's title."
I'm looking forward to meeting you.
Yesterday I was sick.
Movie making is an exciting job.
That's not an issue anymore.
How many minutes does it take to get to the JR station on foot?
The parking lot is empty.
I want to take a break.
Tom is taking a bath now.
Close the door.
That store sells men's wear.
Tom is playing with Mary's cat.
Let's get together again.
I like instrumental music.
I wish I were as smart as you are.
The windows were left open.
Living costs are getting higher.
A lot of fish died.
Give me back the book after you've read it.
Defensive driving can help you avoid accidents.
How's the job hunt going?
"I was going to call Tom, but thought better of it."
He hung up his coat.
Where's my watch?
What's the name of that bird?
"Finally, Tom attained his goal."
What are your strong points?
The river is beautiful.
There are women who find bald men sexy.
Thanks for the feedback.
Tom went to buy dog food.
Tom left without saying anything.
He knocked at the door.
My wife is also here.
Is there an ATM nearby?
I rarely cry.
You should be home with your family.
I don't have a care in the world.
Remove the chicken's giblets before cooking.
Hurry up! The bus is coming!
I feel guilty about it.
"My throat hurts, and I have a fever. Can I have some cold medicine?"
Would you please show me your photo album?
What kind of person is Tom?
"Which do you prefer, tea or coffee?"
It's your turn to sing.
Is there anything else you want to buy?
I've got a toothache.
Tom worried about Mary.
It took me five hours to read through this book.
This fruit is edible.
Trade friction might arise between the two nations at any moment.
I'll race you to the bus stop.
Are you going to be at this afternoon's meeting?

There are a lot of fish in that lake.
We received a large package.
I'm over eighteen.
Was the president in favor of the plan?
He visited Nara by bus.
That was easier than I thought.
Tom rented a car.
You will soon be used to rural life.
How did your test go?
Are Tom and Mary still at work?
I didn't know about it until I read the paper.
Keep your eyes closed.
What do you think of the movie?
It is questionable whether this data can be relied on.
Swimming is my favorite sport.
Most of the passengers on the bus were sleeping.
I want to visit my friend next week.
Is Tom OK?
The only one who laughed was Tom.
I didn't spend a penny.
Tom was just looking.
I told Tom why I'd been in the hospital.
I have three cousins on my mother's side.
She asked after my parents' health when I met her the other day.
Ask me anything!
I feel great.
A foolish impulse made me say what I should have left unsaid.
Tom dried his hands with the towel Mary handed him.
I don't understand French. It's difficult.
The man ate bread.
Is it still snowing?
Tom is quite happy.
Tom is holding a knife.
I visited my grandmother's house.
"As far as I'm concerned, I have no objection to the plan."
The air is wonderful in the woods.
Tom wasn't surprised Mary was there.
I want to rest.
I think Tom may come to Boston for Thanksgiving.
I have sunglasses.
I fell in love with Mary at first sight.
You are always watching TV.
I saw him running.
We will let him try.
How many nights will you be staying?
Don't say anything without thinking.
I hope you'll be pleased with this present.
"I went to see Tom, but he wasn't there."
I'm sorry that I woke you up.
I've decided to stay here.
This machine sometimes breaks down.
The new manager seems like a nice guy.
He thanked the host for the very enjoyable party.
This beer has an alcohol content of 5%.
You can't play tennis on very windy days.
It pays to be polite.
She exploded with laughter.
There are billions of stars in the sky.
Don't forget to answer the letter.
Tom's doing very well these days.
I shouldn't have spent so much money.
He seemed to have been rich.
Admission is free on Sundays.
I've seen this image before.
He is known to everybody.
I mean it!
Tom was the last person I expected to see.
I often run into her at the supermarket.
That's because you're a girl.
"Whenever you visit him, you will find him playing video games."
"No, I didn't help."
I'll be able to see him next year.
I'm sorry to always be bothering you.
"If I lost my key, I wouldn't be able to lock the door."
Tom isn't as rich as Mary.
"When his dog died, he cried his heart out."
It's better to be born lucky than to be born rich.
I overslept.
Let me handle this.
Do you think Tom was hungry?
Eat wherever you want to.
Keep a record of how much you spend.
Leave now.
"You'll come back, right?"
You'd better start at once.
He returned to Japan after graduating from college.
When is checkout time?
A high degree of specialization is required in that company.
It was a very cold winter.
Tom is a guest.
I know those tall girls quite well.
Can you tell me how to get to the nearest station?
Thank you for teaching me French.
You're always late.
You can't be serious! He's no more a doctor than I am.
She sewed a button on her coat.
"Tom has never lied to me, as far as I know."
How much water do you drink a day?
"I think you'll like it, too."
I may have hurt his feelings.
I think that Tom is a genius.
It'll clear up soon.
It looks like snow toward evening.
You're always as busy as a bee.
A storm is coming.
It is said that he is a millionaire.
This one is free.
I've got a question.
I can't forget her smile.
I really enjoyed the picnic.
I'm from the FBI.
"As I grew older, my health declined."
I didn't come here to talk.
Don't forget to buy a present for Tom.
Tom writes short stories.
Tom looks like a clever boy.
"In other words, Tom is lazy."
I got a B in physics.
Can you give me a boat?
"Nobody having any more to say, the meeting was closed."
"Everybody, please listen."
I'll have to have my camera repaired.
Tom is doing a crossword puzzle.
"Yes, I can do it, answered the boy."
Take off your uniform.
I miss my hometown.
We have to start at once.
Tom started to feel like his life wasn't worth living.
I usually get up at six.
"Unfortunately, I already have plans for that day."
My father is now traveling abroad.
Whose shoes are those?
I'm not the expert.
Is it true you learned French all by yourself?
Are you ready to order?
I'm a little dizzy.
Thank you for such a detailed explanation.
Are you going to go talk to Tom or not?
"Though I was sitting in the sun, I still felt chilly."
What is the name of this river?
May I enter?
The cake is delicious.
Which ones are Tom's?
The man who lives next door to me is a doctor.
America is a country of immigrants.
Could you please delete these pictures?
There are a lot of wolves in this area.
No one speaks this language anymore.
He ran away from home.
I'm sure that Tom won't want to sing that song.
I converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius in my head.
I want to send a present for his birthday.
"When she entered the room, he stood up."
Trade friction might arise between the nations at any moment.
Have a little of this cake.
Were you and Tom friends?
She is in low spirits today.
He denied having taken part in the crime.
He has a good reading knowledge of French.
The room was packed with people.
This is the shortest way to the station.
She wants to keep him at a distance.
What's your date of birth?
He's a careful player.
I planted an apple tree in my yard.
Have you ever spoken to Tom?
Would you lend me a pencil?
"Excuse me, but may I use the phone?"
Tom has bought a new computer.
How was the wedding?
Squirrels move quickly.
I was saying that I didn't think that it was weird at all.
The prince was changed into a frog.
Tom doesn't play.
I want to drink coffee.
"He doesn't have any children, but other than that he's leading a happy life."
I need to get started.
Teach me how you do it.
Find a job.
Tom is disappointed.
Just answer the questions.
Your English has improved a lot.
You're weird.
I'm sorry I made you wait so long.
Don't bother Tom while he's reading.
Where's the fitting room?
He gave us the signal to begin.
I'm going in the same direction. Come with me. I'll take you there.
How did you reply?
"You like classical music, don't you?"
Please tell me how to get to the beach.
We have no choice but to do so.
This one's free.
He is unquestionably the oldest man in the village.
He has a good command of English.
He may have been ill.
This clock is out of order.
What did she say?
Choose between these two.
Could you sign this?
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
I can't wait any longer.
Tom is rarely late.
This book is even more interesting than that one.
We booked a room in a four-star hotel.
"Tom likes Mary, too."
Nothing is perfect.
He was the first man to land on the moon.
Tom did something stupid.
I want the fan.
Let's go a little further.
"I was unwilling to agree to the proposal, but it seemed that I had no choice."
The weather's good today.
You should have your eyes examined.
Why don't you consult an attorney?
The bag was too heavy for me to carry by myself.
I'll give you a book.
I have already finished this book.
I thought that Tom and Mary were both under thirty.
I think it's time to go home.
Do you think Tom really meant what he said?
Let's shake hands.
I don't understand your generation.
It is likely to rain this afternoon.
"Tom, your mom's here."
I love happy endings.
I'm interested in computers.
How soon are we going to arrive?
Why don't you ask yourself?
He's just arrived.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Tom was drinking vodka.
You are doing very well.
Either you or I have to go there.
She smiled at me.
We associate Darwin with the theory of evolution.
My older brother did all the preparation.
It's going to rain.
Tom left the room last.
Tom said he agreed.
Tom tried to hurt Mary.
Don't touch it.
You shouldn't have told him about the plan.
I think it would be rude to refuse.
The economy is good.
You're a bad boy.
Do you hate me?
He must be out.
Tom has been bitten by his horse.
We can't change our schedule.
This castle was built in 1610.
"He wanted to see a bullfight, but his father wouldn't let him go."
He wrote the report.
"Turn the light on, please."
I was too tired to walk any more.
I used to be more creative.
"I also have a bit of money, just in case."
She looks young.
Tom likes experimenting.
I remember hearing a very similar story to that.
I did something stupid.
I don't really want to go out today.
There are many old people in this village.
We've never tried doing that.
That isn't quite what I wanted.
Shut your eyes.
I'd like to see her.
Tom wants you to help him wash windows.
She called off the party.
Metals can become brittle at low temperatures.
"I can't write French, but I can read it."
My first car was red.
The men are eating lunch.
I have so many ideas.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You put far too much pepper in it.
"If I'd known that you were sick, I could've visited you in the hospital."
She appeals to me.
This apple tastes sour.
I followed my mother's example.
It's sunny today.
I try to eat an apple a day.
The soldier gave water to me.
She is bustling about in the kitchen.
The hunter hunted rabbits with his dog.
My jaw hurts.
Take your shoes off.
I love studying languages.
I've had similar experiences.
The waitress set a glass of juice in front of me.
These flowers are not only beautiful but also fragrant.
Write on every other line.
"She's well-informed, so she might know something."
Let's eat lunch.
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
All men are equal before God.
"Weather permitting, I'll leave tomorrow."
It's an artificial flower.
Thanks for your comment.
It's very old.
Who are you talking about?
Have you received a letter from him?
Tom isn't holding a knife. He's holding a gun.
Tom hid behind the curtain.
That was an incredibly difficult exam.
You should learn from your mistakes.
The house was unlocked.
I had a nightmare.
How are you two doing?
I cut myself with a knife.
We should have gone on a day that wasn't so hot.
Is there anything to drink in the refrigerator?
I'm worried about my weight.
Thank you for the flowers.
"Tom not only ate his dessert, he also ate Mary's, too."
Basho was the greatest poet.
Could you cancel my reservation?
I want to be a professional violinist.
I had a tough week.
What do you enjoy most about learning French?
Be polite to your parents.
I'm buying a new piano.
His failure in business left him penniless.
I've got more money than I know what to do with.
I had no other choice.
I'll be back in three minutes.
I'll wait another five minutes.
Go and see the doctor.
What do you say to a bus tour next Saturday?
Does Tom like sushi?
"You don't have to apologize, Tom."
I'm afraid this data is not reliable.
Tom said he's depressed.
Tom doesn't have any kids.
Everything that I saw was completely different from what I had expected.
He got off the bus.
Even a child knows right from wrong.
Fix this.
The storm caused a lot of damage.
"Could you wrap this separately, please?"
Kyoto used to be the capital of Japan.
We can see thousands of stars in the sky.
"When I was thirteen, someone told me I was really good at French."
The Nozomi is the fastest of all the trains in Japan.
My eyes are watering.
Everyone knows I'm Tom's girlfriend.
"When Tom woke up, he found that Mary had disappeared."
"By the time you get back, I'll be gone."
That was the first time I'd ever seen a koala.
These clothes are dirty and need washing.
I'm telling you this because I'm worried about you.
You must keep in mind that she's much younger than you.
A lot of people who have up until now been spending money having a good time now need to be more careful with their money.
I don't agree with the government's policy on education.
Would you mind closing the door?
Is the room big enough?
He is a person who never cuts corners.
I've only just come back.
They didn't do it.
I'm bottle-feeding my baby.
I live in comfort.
I walked the whole way to the station.
What do you want to do now?
"We considered going, but finally decided against it."
Mother insists that I should eat more vegetables.
Is this water okay to drink?
Open that window over there.
I'm afraid of cats.
She types well.
That's all I have.
"French is too hard, so I don't think I want to learn it."
This is very easy.
Do you care how much it costs?
Let's try it once more.
She will accompany me on the piano.
How should I know?
Tom did a foolish thing.
Tom and Mary plan to stay there as long as they can.
"If he had taken his doctor's advice, he might still be alive."
Something's wrong with this washing machine.
He solved the difficult problem easily.
My uncle has a good knowledge of French.
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
Would you mind letting me see your passport?
My arm is hurting badly.
He remains sick in bed.
I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
How many days are there in a year?
I also noticed that.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
My efforts produced no results.
"I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully."
French is definitely not a difficult language.
The thought flashed through her mind that she was going to die.
Our refrigerator is out of order.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I plan to go to the movies.
Can I take your picture?
Don't hang up!
I want some water to drink.
These are my books.
This store sells vegetables.
My hands are shaking.
I hope that it doesn't rain today.
My credit card was rejected by the ATM.
Is that why you hired me?
I wonder who invented it.
The politician tried to cover up the insider trading.
There's no one in that room.
Please switch on the light.
Tom is out in the garden.
I moved to a new apartment.
Tom is curious.
A good idea occurred to me last night.
She reminded him to go to the bank.
Could you please autograph this book?
Everybody was having fun.
What's your name?
Tom is already there.
Birds fly.
She had a happy childhood.
Tom doesn't need to do that.
I don't eat nuts.
I felt guilty.
I can't do two things at once.
My daughter wants a piano.
I considered changing my job.
I hope you'll answer me soon.
The cost of living is rising.
What's the secret?
Take this medicine every six hours.
We joined the country club.
The committee was composed entirely of young teachers.
Ten years have passed since he died.
Tom teaches.
Are you able to solve it?
They never go out in the evening with their children.
He probably won't come.
These oranges have gone bad.
I've already finished my homework.
She looked lonely.
This isn't my ticket.
Dogs have masters. Cats have servants.
I'm going to work in the garden tomorrow if it isn't raining.
Which direction is north?
Tom wants to help.
I confided my troubles to him.
Tom was fast asleep.
There isn't much furniture in my room.
I studied hard to pass the exam.
This sounds reasonable.
Her youngest child is five years old.
I don't feel like going out right now.
I am coming.
He invited me to a party.
I want to climb Mt. Fuji again.
We're right behind you.
Tom lives close by.
Is Tom going to help Mary?
Can you put me up tonight?
He was covered all over with paint.
Thank you for setting the record straight.
"Tom is good with kids, isn't he?"
I haven't heard anything from him since then. I wonder what he's up to.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
He worked hard at the risk of his health.
The teacher patted me on the back.
They set fire to their neighbor's house in revenge.
He took out a book about the history of coins.
Please don't tell anyone.
The wind is blowing really hard.
I think I need to finish that work before noon.
Put it back on the shelf.
I remember the warmth of his arms.
I'll be back at seven o'clock.
He is an old friend of mine.
The matter is now under consideration.
"Pick on somebody your own size, you bully."
It's good to be home.
I met some hikers on the mountain.
"Tom is a man, and I'm a woman."
Do it yourself.
Not many people like opera.
I was bitten by a spider.
I acted for our captain while he was in the hospital.
I think Tom's father is a lawyer.
He's the most valuable player on our team.
Please make yourself at home.
We walked around the pond.
I had to run to the station.
She is shy and always remains in the background.
I swear that's true.
Why didn't you come to the party?
Most boys like baseball.
We should start getting Christmas gifts for the children.
It doesn't matter whether you win or not.
"Will you study after dinner? ""Yes, I will."""
My sister has a job.
"For me, skiing is by far more interesting than skating."
"The more you have, the more you want."
I'm waiting for the ferry.
Will it clear up this afternoon?
He can count up to ten with his fingers.
He's been friendly with my kid brother.
The water flows under the bridge.
The two factions joined forces.
"After you finish reading the book, put it back where it was."
The lights went out just now.
That used to be my favorite band.
"Did she buy a watch? ""Yes, she did."""
Don't worry.
Can you pick me up at the station?
Feta cheese has a lot of salt.
I'm at my wit's end.
We had a kid just last year.
Tom runs a food bank in Boston.
Sit wherever you like.
Thank you for coming all the way to see me off.
Do you have a point card?
I'm not too clear about that point.
That helped.
He worked last night without taking a break.
Don't tantalize me.
You have to apologize at once when you have done wrong.
Is there anywhere near here where I can park my car?
Can you wake me up at seven o'clock tomorrow morning?
I need to fix my bicycle.
I'm not satisfied with the result at all.
Let me get you something to drink.
How is it going?
"If you are to do well in school, you must study hard."
What's the tallest mountain in Europe?
I shouldn't have stayed up all night.
I don't want to go anywhere.
I purchased one bag.
Is there something that you want to say?
Didn't anything else happen?
I can't wait to go to college.
Even my mom knows it.
This knife is used to cut meat.
I spent the night in my car.
A whale is a mammal.
This room has three windows.
We set up the tent next to the river.
I thought we were going to go somewhere.
You can't stay in here all day.
Are you making friends here?
They're easy to make and they're cheap.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
I will take the one that is more expensive.
Is there something you'd like to ask me?
Garden tools make a nice gift.
It's rained a lot this year.
Tom didn't call the police.
Grandfather has retired because he is getting old.
I thought we were going to die.
Lawyers make a lot of money.
How's school?
You talk so fast I can't understand a word you say.
I'm telling you the truth.
"I like Tom, but I don't love him."
Why did you do that?
We try.
I feel unwell.
I have a sore throat and a slight fever.
I think she's over 40 years old.
You should not give liquor to children.
Tom has an important job.
Please prepare for the trip.
Tom escaped in a stolen car.
I have a blister on my foot.
It was a heartbreaking story.
Everything is all right.
Tom lost a lot of weight.
She came to see me.
He couldn't come because he was sick.
I think you should stop smoking.
Is that what you mean?
"No matter what anyone says, I plan to go."
I want to play outside with my friends.
That's easy to understand.
I had four tests this week.
Is there any reason not to go to the beach today?
This tea smells good.
"I suspected that he was telling a lie, but that didn't surprise me."
Promise that you won't forget me.
What's your point?
I immediately decided to turn off the light and go to sleep.
I don't care what people think about me anymore.
He is a fine gentleman.
Tom put the book on the table.
I really wonder how much the inheritance tax will amount to.
I'll stay if it rains.
She saw him at the station.
I always try to eat a healthy diet.
Tom will probably be the one who comes.
There are many good restaurants near here.
"I got home, took my shoes off and went to bed."
He was paralyzed by fear.
Who's Tom?
I wish I'd brought an umbrella with me.
Tom didn't want to come to Australia with us.
Get your friend to help you.
She is absorbed in rock music.
The tree was bending under the weight of the fruit.
Tom died from food poisoning.
The man I talked to on the bus said that he'd been to Australia three times.
The day is almost over.
I can't stand it any longer.
Nobody has heard of it but me.
Do you really need to ask that?
Dr. Jackson has a lot of patience.
Who said that I didn't like Tom?
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
The cold winter will soon be over.
Thank you very much for all you have done.
Most Swiss people can speak three or four languages.
I don't want to say that to my girlfriend.
I'm going to stay here for a couple of days.
"A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him around."
I didn't quite make out what he said.
I left my mobile phone at home.
Do as you like.
Are you Canadian?
We don't have enough coffee.
Was that a squirrel?
Tom always carries a gun.
Millions of workers lost their jobs.
That's too bad.
My favorite drink is black tea.
I heard something interesting from a friend yesterday.
I'd like to call my parents.
Were you able to solve the problem?
She and I have nothing in common.
I'm looking for a lipstick to go with this nail polish.
Finally we arrived at the lake.
The children are making a snowman.
My mother speaks slowly.
I was about to go to bed when the phone rang.
It's not fair.
Please have some cake.
That's an incredible story.
I made plans.
The dog pursued a rabbit into the forest.
It's a ten-minute walk to school.
The express train is an hour faster than the local.
I said stay back.
Tom sent Mary home.
It was a very enjoyable afternoon.
"When I don't have anything to say, I'm not embarrassed to be quiet."
Where do you want to live?
The water was lukewarm.
I've only been to Boston once.
Tom decided to study French.
Please come back next week.
He was accused of murder.
It has nothing to do with the subject we're discussing.
Don't leave your stuff behind.
I think Tom is a very kind man.
I'm really confused.
The serious job shortage is also affecting those illegal foreign workers.
Can I ask you something?
Tell me why you were absent from school yesterday.
He renounced the ownership of the land.
My mother made me a sweater.
A child was run over here last night.
We're making progress.
I'm at a loss for words.
Dinner is ready.
This lid is too tight for me to open.
What time will we arrive in Boston?
School begins on the April 8th.
Three people are still missing.
It is time I left here.
It's impossible to live on that island.
That's when I injured my ankle.
My car is German.
Cabbage can also be eaten raw.
Tomorrow will be a big day.
You're not even safe in your own home.
I fully agree.
What is a zip code?
The race was fixed.
She phoned him as soon as she got home.
Tom went to the kitchen to get a snack.
He looks strong.
I think that it's unlikely I'll be able to pass my driving test.
I want to see what Tom is doing.
He's a fast walker.
I know that I don't deserve you.
I don't think that anyone else could do my job.
This is cute.
This is something we cannot do without.
I don't really read newspapers.
We checked the document again.
It's really annoying.
Let's eat before the food gets cold.
He's a work horse.
Thank you for sharing your ideas with us.
Soon you'll get used to living by yourself.
I'm getting better every day.
"During the Depression in the 1930's, many wealthy people lost everything in the stock market crash."
"My monthly wage is 300,000 yen."
"She wore a long, loose coat."
Don't ever say that again.
I wear white shirts on weekdays.
"If you're tired, just let me know."
He said he read this book in a day.
We don't have a television.
Tom and Mary are siblings.
Mary has big eyes.
Please show me another one.
Did you believe that girl?
It's not bad.
It may rain any minute.
I think it's unlikely I'll be able to pass my driving test.
We must keep a diary every day.
Tom is patient.
He walked so fast that I couldn't keep up with him.
He was wearing glasses.
Is there an ATM nearby?
I'm going to attend the meeting.
It's about 30 minutes from here on foot.
I waited for her for one hour.
My daughter is being toilet trained.
Mark the words that you cannot understand.
It rained for three days.
I can't dye my hair. My mom would kill me!
Are you a student?
Tom always sings out of tune.
How was your trip?
"I know the reason, but I can't tell you."
I have a twin.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
I bought these books three days ago.
"If I remember correctly, Tom's birthday is October 20th."
I thought that I was going to become a doctor.
Stay home until six.
There is no hope of his being appointed.
I don't watch TV often.
Can I push the button?
I don't smoke.
Eating too much is bad for your health.
Tom doesn't understand the difference between confidence and arrogance.
You can see the whole park from the restaurant.
Forget your troubles for a while and come and have dinner with us.
Some flowers bloom in the spring and other flowers bloom in the fall.
I always photograph badly.
You can't be serious! He's no more a doctor than I am.
Is it still raining?
You can choose whichever color you like.
Would you like to dance with me?
I didn't study at all yesterday.
Something has fallen by your feet.
I always stay at this hotel.
There are only three girls in the class.
"Hurry up, or you will be late."
"To make a long story short, I was fired."
He's above telling lies.
Put the phone down.
I think Tom is really a good guy.
"Today, too, the temperature is below zero."
I was going to do that yesterday.
She goes to school.
Don't get carried away.
I'll beat you up!
Put on your mask.
Tom's new cat doesn't like me.
"I bought a pen, but I lost it."
He canceled his trip.
Tom said he's afraid to do that.
"Excuse me, but do you mind if I ask your name?"
What's a census?
We had no choice but to leave the matter to him.
Tom seems to be very happy.
The peace talks begin this week.
You should begin with easier questions.
The light has turned green.
Was yesterday a cold day?
I wish I'd brought my camera.
We're closed on weekends.
"I didn't want the baby to catch a cold, so I closed the window."
Tom didn't drink the milk.
That's not wine. It's grape juice.
What makes you think Tom likes heavy metal?
I seldom listen to the radio.
A month has passed and the work has made little progress.
You look just like your father.
I can't wait to go back to Boston.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
She told me today that she loved me.
I burned the roof of my mouth.
Let's wait until tomorrow.
I have an appointment with my uncle tomorrow.
He anticipated traveling abroad the next year.
Are Tom and Mary getting back together?
"Tom wasn't wrong, was he?"
I'm really good at finding four-leaf clovers.
A calculator is more efficient than an abacus.
How do you feel? he asked.
Tom said that he'd never ever do that.
I'm no liar.
I plan to stay here until I run out of money.
Shut the door.
I'd like to buy eye drops.
My grandfather is 90 years old and very lively.
Children grow up so quickly.
How did you know my parents?
I don't know how to handle children.
I want to eat something good.
How many flights to Tokyo do you offer a day?
There's no limit.
Why did you open this box?
Yesterday I got up early.
Can you make room for me?
The man who is driving the bus is my best friend.
I ate curry rice last night.
Have you tried to apologize to Tom?
I don't agree with the decision.
I was criticized for doing that.
"That company puts out a magazine, doesn't it?"
He has never come on time that I know of.
Everyone knows about Tom.
"Hey, what happened?"
You didn't need to take a taxi.
I know that Tom is a health nut.
Someone's knocking on the door.
"Write your name and address, please."
What makes you so sad?
Tom told his boss what he had in mind.
I'm not sleepy.
"What did she say? ""I don't remember."""
It would be impolite to refuse.
I don't know exactly when he will arrive.
Add a little oil.
Tom checked his watch.
I've run out of milk.
I must remember to see her.
Hold on a second.
I'm glad to see you.
Please water the flowers.
I'm studying hard for entrance exams.
All you have to do is sign this paper.
I haven't seen Tom since October.
Who are you waiting for?
I don't belong to the club.
It was courteous of him to write a letter of thanks.
"I don't think it will rain, but I'll take an umbrella in case it does."
That's all for tonight.
I just wanted to sleep.
Do you have a table on the patio?
You can go home.
One for all and all for one.
Get Tom.
I never thought you'd do that.
Tom said he'd get home by 2:30.
He is making cookies.
Tom came straight home after school.
I will grant that you are right on this point.
Maybe it's time to change my hair and do a makeover.
The room was a complete mess.
I don't think you should take Tom to Boston with you.
It was getting louder and louder.
A sensible person wouldn't speak to you like that.
Do the best you can.
I'm concerned with Tom's safety.
I accused him of cheating.
She gave a small cry of alarm and fled to the bathroom.
We expect him to succeed.
I had lived in Sendai for ten years before I visited Matsushima.
I'm not a fan of horror movies.
"That's no good, Tom."
Do you think eating with your family is important?
We will leave in an hour.
It seems that Tom only eats fruits and vegetables.
I made it myself.
I have seen a UFO before.
Mom will buy us a puppy.
This book has many beautiful pictures.
We like English the best of all our subjects.
This is called shorthand.
She's used to getting up early.
How are you getting along with your new classmates?
Tom is probably not awake yet.
I had to agree.
French is their mother tongue.
Today we are going to discuss this problem in terms of morality.
Can you get it repaired?
There's no knife.
This one is by far better.
Why did you join this organization?
Tom lacks courage.
The local brew is excellent.
Is there a problem?
I should be more careful.
I've never played soccer.
I immediately called the police.
I can do it today.
I haven't eaten since breakfast and I'm very hungry.
I can't wait for summer vacation to start.
Who found this?
Sport transcends borders.
Would you like some more salad?
Nobody noticed that the picture was hung upside down.
She's taller than him.
His briefcase was filled with water.
A dog bit her leg.
He always tries to have his own way.
Tom is going to be thirty next October.
I want to fly above the clouds.
Tom was arrested the next day.
Stay awake.
That's a good approach.
"Wow, that's a lot of flowers! ""I love flowers."""
Let's get started anyway.
I have a few friends in the United States.
"So, what's the problem?"
My headache has gone.
I know that you're a teacher.
Are you getting sleepy?
The train leaves at half past two.
The date will be set later.
I was also impressed with the school's cleanliness and the students' pride in it.
I'd like to have some hot soup.
Tom brought a puppy to school.
This soup is too salty to eat.
I wish that I were young again.
I'm paid by the hour.
Everybody is busy except me.
Can you tell me what time it is?
Is it true that Tom is dating a Japanese girl?
Tom's dream is to become an astronaut.
This puzzle is too hard for me.
Is Tom going to go skating tomorrow?
Have you ever told your boyfriend a lie?
Could I please borrow your pen?
Is the movie theater near the station?
Show me the picture.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
"Hurry up, or you will miss the train."
"Judge him by what he does, not by his appearance."
Did you bring warm clothes?
May I make a suggestion about it?
It sounds like a scam.
I hear you are good at cooking.
I should've come here by bicycle.
He's in trouble.
Go somewhere else. I want to be alone.
I can't drink wine.
Tom usually doesn't have to work on Monday afternoons.
We talked over a cup of coffee.
Where can this gift certificate be used?
I wish I hadn't bought so many.
Let's decide on the places we'll visit.
A cold bath refreshed him.
Tom translated the text into French.
I keep my hammer in the toolbox.
Could you tell me the way to the subway station?
He is fond of fishing.
Wait for me. I'll be there in about ten minutes.
The police are suspicious of my alibi.
You'll never achieve anything if you don't study harder.
"I'm home, Mom!"
I had lunch around eleven because I was hungry.
My dog and I sleep in the same room.
I've never heard my mother sing a song.
This factory manufactures automobile parts.
She's usually home on Sundays.
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
It's just after three o'clock.
Tom was standing on the doorstep.
I want you to read this book.
I enjoy intellectual conversations.
That's a book.
Do you know what Tom is doing now?
It's too bad we're not out fishing.
Is it five already?
I don't drink much wine.
He looks well.
"There's no evidence, is there?"
I just want your love.
Tom exploded in anger.
Stop grumbling.
I'm engaged in AIDS research.
Tom said that Mary is doing that now.
Do you like white wine?
Tom can't stand the sight of blood.
Tom filled the bathtub with water.
I bought a frozen pizza at the supermarket.
"Can you repeat that, please?"
How do you feel about your father?
You're on the path to success.
I couldn't help laughing at the sight.
His beating four competitors in a row won our high school team the championship.
"If you had a million yen, what would you do with it?"
I do not want to cause you any trouble.
I know Tom is strong.
I think that it's time to go home.
It isn't as hot today as it was yesterday.
I'll be able to see you next year.
Your fly's open.
Do you have a big family?
I'm going with Tom.
How much butter do you use?
Are these all the sizes you have?
My parents live near the ocean.
Mary is a working mother.
Are you sure you remember everything?
"Starting next year, my brother will be working at a bank."
You tried to kill me.
It's important to be honest.
It is close to seven o'clock.
It's always difficult for a son to live up to the expectations of his parents.
We're booked on flight 308.
You shouldn't give up just because you have no talent.
He remained calm even in the presence of danger.
It looks hot outside.
My daughter is barely fifteen.
We're going to Boston tomorrow.
He never touches alcoholic drinks.
Look at the setting sun.
Will he get well?
Push the door open.
Would you like a mint?
The parking lot is nearly empty.
Tom is sloshed.
"No matter what you say, I won't give up."
Tom put the racket on the ground.
Tom doesn't want Mary to go to Boston.
I'm a bachelor.
I always watch documentaries.
I told Tom not to go to Boston.
It's two miles from here to the station.
He runs in the park every day.
"I'm worn out, because I've been standing all day."
You always talk too much.
Tom can eat a banana in three seconds.
I've never seen Tom cry.
Tom was drenched from head to toe.
The trees kept me out of the rain.
His decision to stay there was a surprise to all of us.
I'm fine with that.
"I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the train."
You're free to use this room.
What do you want to eat?
Have you ever had an out-of-body experience?
Where's a bathroom?
Iron's atomic number is 26.
Tom started drinking.
He felt a sudden pain.
Tom bought a mobile phone.
I made her angry.
I thought that Tom had a dog.
Your smoking bothers me.
It was a mistake.
Our dog is very big.
It was like watching a slow motion movie.
I was late for school.
I escaped from the sinking boat with difficulty.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.
She got married to him.
It would be better if you didn't drink so much coffee late at night.
You'd better not eat too much.
That book is easy.
Basketball is a lot of fun.
My aunt dropped in on me yesterday.
She majors in child psychology.
The roads were slippery.
There isn't anyone in the room.
Tom has moved to Boston.
I've already talked to Tom about his grades.
You shouldn't run around with a toothbrush in your mouth.
I wasn't yet asleep at that time.
"Just a moment, please."
I would often go skating on the lake.
"Tom likes fishing, doesn't he?"
He's a funny guy.
I have a spare key.
They mistook him for his brother.
"If you can't make it, call us as soon as possible."
There is no wind today.
Tom's bicycle was stolen.
He has been dead for three years.
They're plotting to kill the king.
He's good at riding horses.
He is nice.
May I use your bathroom?
I know that Tom can swim.
We're going by train.
Stop ordering me around.
My brother must be sick.
Tom's concert was very good.
It's unusual for him to get up early.
Drink lots of water.
Some people love pumpkin pie and others hate it.
Tom's house is full of toys.
I'm used to driving a truck.
"I hear Tom and Mary are getting a divorce. ""That's the rumor."""
My friends came to see me the day before yesterday.
The wedding was put off.
I think it'll be easy to do the job.
"Shut the door behind you, please."
They are both unmarried.
Watermelons are in season now.
I couldn't understand anything.
I want to earn a lot of money.
Prices will increase after October 20th.
It's said that he knows the secret.
The argument ended in a fight.
Are you coming back tonight?
I'm looking for someone to travel to Boston with me.
He taught history at school.
If you needed money you should've told me.
Could we have a table by the window?
It's the same every year.
Do you know what they call a French horn in French?
Do you still have the book?
They talked over a cup of coffee.
I'm sure that you'll succeed.
I wish I didn't have to work.
I hope Tom doesn't think that we hate him.
Tom still remembers his grandfather.
Tom wrote his name on the cover of his notebook.
I try not to dwell on the past.
"He gives plain, simple explanations."
Please hold on.
We played games for about an hour and a half.
How many brothers and sisters do you have?
I want to learn about American daily life.
There's a festival in the village.
Your mother sounds like a nice person.
I slept soundly.
Tom asked me why I wanted to go to Australia.
Does it hurt when you breathe?
She stood close to her husband.
I sleep upstairs.
Your dog isn't here.
Little attention was paid to the comfort for the passengers.
The car he was riding crashed into a train.
She was worried that she might miss the train.
I want everybody to know I'm not a murderer.
She helped an old man cross the road.
Don't be so hard on me.
Aren't you mad at Tom?
You should've kept it secret.
It's better to be approximately right than completely wrong.
I awoke to find myself completely refreshed.
"Generally, women live 10 years longer than men."
Tom majored in geology.
It'll take an hour to get there.
Open your mouth.
Can I extend my stay?
Who threw this stone through the window?
Tom said that Mary was really drunk.
"Why were 14,000 soldiers lost?"
Let's keep this a secret.
"I'm not from around here, so I don't know this area well."
It's high time you children went to bed.
Tom had some gum stuck on the bottom of one of his shoes.
The light came on suddenly.
He will come back soon.
Where can I put my luggage?
Which is the platform for the London train?
Tom drank a lot of vodka on his trip to Russia.
I can sing some French songs.
I always have a look at the newspaper before breakfast.
I'm in school.
"I'm all thumbs, so I'm not very good at origami."
The surgeon persuaded him to undergo an organ transplant.
He doesn't live here anymore.
The factory uses many complicated machines.
His explanation is unconvincing.
It seems that he's a student.
My shoes are dirty.
Shut the door.
I never want to do this again.
It's been five years since my father died.
I don't think Tom will mind.
I believed that he would keep his promise.
"If anyone wants to buy a house, please let me know."
I used to read detective stories before going to bed.
Mary is a woman's name.
All of us were silent.
See you again.
I suspect that Tom and Mary don't like me.
Our company isn't very big.
Is Tom still looking for Mary?
Do you want some dessert?
Tom gave a rose to Mary.
"If you see a mistake, then please correct it."
Why don't we play chess together sometime?
What's the bus fare?
It tasted good.
Tom slept.
"As soon as she saw me, she burst out crying."
I rarely go to church.
Start writing.
This blouse is cotton.
Who was it that forgot to lock the door of the warehouse?
Neither Tom nor Mary has any money in the bank.
How is it going with your family?
You drink too much.
I ripped open the envelope.
Don't overdo it.
This vending machine takes only hundred-yen coins.
Golf is boring.
As many as twenty students were absent.
I met Tom in the library on Monday.
I'm cooperative.
What kind of person do you want to be?
I felt like I needed to say something.
How about taking a walk?
It isn't always cold here.
Never rely too much upon others.
Would you please show me another one?
He walked slowly so the child could follow.
He's always short of money.
I think that it was probably last Friday.
I practice three hours every day.
You have no business complaining about the matter.
"I'd rather you didn't, if you don't mind."
I should have listened more carefully.
There are a lot of places to see around here.
I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
I live with my parents.
I'd like to try some Thai food.
Can you join the team?
Please don't die.
It is no use studying when you are sleepy.
"The sooner you go, the better."
Read this when you have time.
It is raining hard.
I had a slight headache last night.
"Tom said, ""You can kiss your girlfriend goodbye if you don't kiss her goodbye,"" which meant, ""If you don't kiss your girlfriend goodbye, then you'll never see her again."""
I was feeling blue all day.
Watch your step.
Would you like to go fishing with us?
I agree with you and Tom.
Do you have a question?
I'll turn a blind eye this time.
"You don't need to pay anything. Today, dinner is on me."
That's enough.
She's as busy as Tom.
There's a lot of dust in the air.
Tom swims well.
My grandfather bought it for me.
Practice makes perfect.
I just didn't want Tom to get hurt.
Why do I need to learn this?
I didn't eat the bread because the crust was moldy.
I broke my leg in a traffic accident.
It's all right to cry.
I had no choice but to accept the offer.
That's not true.
Do you want to know who I am?
I still think Tom is hiding something.
What do you want?
I'm not a thief.
You shouldn't speak ill of others.
Tom can speak French as well.
What size shoes do you wear?
The bad weather ruined our plans.
I prefer reading books to watching television.
You aren't permitted to bring dogs into this building.
When is your lunch break?
Please come tomorrow.
Could you fix my flat tire?
The mouse got caught in a mousetrap.
I met her a week ago.
He looks like a good boy.
Stir the soup.
Whose idea was this?
Can't you talk to Tom for me?
Mary looks like she's mad.
Wine is an alcoholic beverage.
She must have been very beautiful when she was young.
She is good at playing tennis.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Please refrain from smoking.
Man cannot live forever.
I've never been to Europe.
I went to school in my pajamas.
"Unfortunately, it rained that day."
The other day I went fishing for the first time in my life.
Here we are.
A car stopped at the entrance.
My father made me a delicious lunch.
Is it true that Tom won the race?
He lacks common sense.
That's what everyone said.
This doll has big eyes.
Please call me.
Everybody knows it.
"She didn't have any money, so she couldn't go with me."
I have a lot of homework to do.
It is very cold today.
"I love music, too."
I built this dog house all by myself.
I was invited to lunch.
He clung to the hope that he could be a lawyer.
I'm alone.

I was lucky.
Who built the snowman?
Tom was like a father to Mary.
I'm done.
Tom was absorbed in his work.
Tom has no idea how to deal with this problem.
He graduated from college last year.
Don't forget to put out the fire.
I'm going to find Tom.
I prefer poetry to novels.
There's nothing more important than friendship.
I have no idea what that is.
Does Tom have to be there?
I wonder why Tom got angry.
I asked Tom why he didn't like Mary.
He is much older than he looks.
How long does it take to get from here to your house on foot?
I caught him trying to sneak out.
I'll treat you to dinner.
I get along with my younger brother.
I promise you I'll help Tom.
Why would Tom quit?
May I help you?
It was overcast yesterday.
He can speak Russian as well.
Who opened the window?
I don't want any money.
Say something.
He accumulated his fortune by hard work.
Why do you say that?
I'm just a plain office worker.
Don't cry! I'll buy you a new one.
Don't come to school if you have a cold.
She's a modern girl.
How many kinds of cheese do you use on your pizzas?
I spent $300 today.
I think that Tom has a headache.
"Excuse me, but let me have another look at the photo."
"She stood silently, her head tilted slightly to one side."
I thought that Tom wasn't seeing anyone.
"Instead of going myself, I sent a letter."
Is this Tom's office?
She acknowledged his help in her book.
There was a light burning in the window.
You should make good use of your time.
Thanks!
My family isn't that large.
Tom says he regrets doing that.
It's not illegal.
Choose any one of these books that you like.
How's the weather there?
Who will look after the baby?
That's all I can say right now.
I turned right.
I'll go change.
We lost our way in the woods.
"You're not going to do it, I hope."
There must be a misunderstanding.
It's getting light.
How did you get this money?
Please take your shoes off.
Could you please leave the door open?
I think I'll go for a walk.
Warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes.
Something must be done!
How dare you talk to me like that!
The museum is open from 9 a.m.
Could you wait a little while?
This is the house he was born in.
"If you are going to have a party, please count me in."
We named our oldest son after my grandfather.
She is a college graduate.
Tom was liked by everyone.
He couldn't bear to be apart from her.
The roof of the hut groaned under the weight of the snow.
The map that Tom drew for me wasn't very useful.
The war is still going on.
He sat there with his eyes closed.
I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
Tom seemed excited to see Mary.
Help me dismantle it.
I made friends with her during my stay in London.
You're fearless.
Tom scarfed down his cereal in a hurry.
He flew a kite with his son.
I don't know how to get along with those difficult people.
I had my sister take a picture of me.
How much is this pen?
I hope this fine weather lasts till the weekend.
Call Tom soon.
This isn't true.
We're looking for a man named Tom Jackson.
What did she say?
It is up to you.
I was just thinking of a new job.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning.
French is hard.
Do you like fried chicken?
Excuse me. You dropped this.
Do as you're told.
How are you doing these days?
May I borrow your pen?
Tom is in a good mood today.
"My father doesn't drink. ""Neither does my father."""
Where is the taxi stand?
I don't have the courage to ask my boss to lend me his car.
I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
The problem was too much for me.
Where's the train station?
There's nothing to worry about.
"One of my sons is a teacher, and the other is a doctor."
Someone's calling my name.
She turned her back to me.
I caught my sweater on that nail.
Do you know what time it is in Boston?
They stood up simultaneously.
We had native guides on our trip to the mountain.
She would have fallen into the pond if he had not caught her by the arm.
I would like to see it.
Did Tom do that?
I don't want to go outside.
Good medicine tastes bitter.
He has a hard time remembering names.
Tom is going to sleep on the sofa.
He writes to his mother every now and then.
He seems to make nothing of it.
All you have to do is sweep the floor.
Anybody can make a mistake.
His death was a great loss to our firm.
You have very pretty eyes.
My sister made me a beautiful doll.
"Come on, follow me."
He sent me a birthday card.
I want you to call Tom.
"It's dark, so watch your step."
I have left my car keys behind.
The small dog tried to get away.
Tom is really depressed.
My husband and I used to go mountain climbing together.
It's really hot outside today.
Please speak in French.
Tom wants to live in this country.
She gave it her personal attention.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Who will compensate for the loss?
None of us can speak French.
We won't be able to arrive home in time.
"Tea, please."
I'm really bad at parallel parking.
Tom plays the piano very well.
No one knows who'll win the next race.
I was tired of the work.
We had no choice but to go there.
She shut the door on her finger.
This bookcase is easy to assemble.
Can I stay here with you?
My wife showed excellent taste in decorating the room.
We should approach this problem from different angles.
"Unless you hurry, you'll be late for school."
Tom saw a doctor.
Did you get your wish?
Who's the best French speaker in your family?
I like tomato soup.
Tom works part-time.
Tom stooped and picked up the coin.
He was then a boy of ten.
There isn't any food left.
Go upstairs and bring down my trunk.
It's so rare.
That's lovely! Where did you get it?
The tourists were ripped off at the nightclub.
Why is everyone so happy?
I'll just go for a walk to clear my head.
No one was there but Tom.
Not a star was to be seen in the sky.
Take your hat off when you enter a temple.
I think that you're right.
I'm extremely tired.
I think Tom was hungry.
I met Tom in the winter a number of years ago.
That baby is Tom.
Does anyone want some more pie?
Goodbye till tomorrow.
We should've paid attention to the announcement.
Strike while the iron is hot.
He is likely to win the championship.
I decided not to go anywhere.
This is well written.
I always give something to the beggars.
Our flight was canceled.
This pizza is really quite good.
I have a feeling that he knows the secret.
I trust him completely.
Parents are responsible for the safety of their children.
Maybe I should wear gloves.
You look like an idiot.
Are you armed?
Please give me this pen.
I now view life differently than I used to.
What time do you start check-in?
My car isn't going to last much longer.
Tom was all ears.
Let's ask if it's true.
Stop that.
For some reason or other I cannot bring myself to work.
What should I do in order to save time?
A true friend would've acted differently.
Could you please tell me how to get to the station?
He was surprised at the news.
"It's warm today, isn't it?"
I didn't know you were coming here either.
I regret missing the speech.
This should help.
The street was bustling with shoppers.
Are you satisfied now?
"We ordered pink, but we received blue."
"I will go, provided the weather is clear."
He looks young.
You should call your mother as soon as possible.
I can't protect you.
My father works in a factory.
Washing clothes by hand is hard and time-consuming.
My parents gave me a house when we got married.
I walked toward the park.
I almost drowned.
Tom got injured playing football.
Tom isn't carrying an umbrella.
I think it's unlikely that a situation like this one would ever occur again.
It's like a dream.
It might rain.
It is very cold this morning.
He said that he wanted some money.
"That student runs fast, doesn't he?"
You must not stay up late.
Years passed.
You may take whichever you like.
Don't tell anyone what I said.
I've had a slight fever since this morning.
"They didn't believe us at first, but now they do."
I never should've gotten married.
They have four classes in the morning.
I was very happy to meet Tom again.
Tom knew it already.
The watch was not to be found anywhere.
The wind has died down.
Tom bought an electric bike.
Sorry I haven't fixed dinner tonight. I was so tired there was just no way.
I had the good fortune to succeed.
Does anybody in your family smoke?
Sorry for asking so many questions.
He extended his right arm.
Don't be a fool.
The principal shook hands with each of the graduates.
We had a quiz today.
I could hear doors slamming.
I don't like school.
Where can I buy a ticket?
I wonder if Tom will really come this evening.
Dreams sometimes come true.
Why did you come this early?
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
I like it very much.
I put the receiver to my ear.
The wedding was canceled at the last minute.
Where can I find a coffee shop that's open late?
Are there many tall buildings in Boston?
It's a TV.
I'm not good enough for you.
I don't understand what you mean.
"How far is it from here to your school? ""It's about ten minute's walk."""
My hobby is collecting coins.
Don't laugh.
I don't like girls who put on airs.
"After dinner, we played cards till eleven."
Can I hold your hand?
There is almost no water in the glass.
I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
I gave my cold to him.
Where did you get the motorcycle?
He broke into a house.
Why don't we try calling Tom?
I'll be more careful next time.
How is your name spelled?
I live in the city.
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
I get a physical examination once a year.
"Who kissed Tom first, Mary or Alice?"
Don't leave it up to chance.
Could you go to the supermarket and buy some butter for me?
"Excuse me, but I feel sick."
My father died at 54.
I need to study math.
I don't want to change into my gym clothes.
There used to be a bridge here.
Of course she passed the test.
Tonight you can stay up as late as you like.
Isn't that your dictionary?
Tom has three kids now.
Tom made a serious error.
Kittens are very playful.
It was the best day of my life.
Are you a fan of mystery novels?
I had a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Those shoes gave me blisters.
You know that I'm married.
Could you open the car window?
I didn't want to go any further.
I'm glad to accept your invitation.
We had lunch together.
Wait over there.
Please hurry.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
"The contract, if you were forced to sign it, is invalid."
Be careful. It's hot.
I came to say hi.
"Since he was able to walk so far, he must have strong legs."
I'm not good with apologies.
Tom sharpened his ax.
The food tasted slightly of garlic.
I'm looking for something to clean the carpet with.
Tom noticed that the door was unlocked.
He was drunk on beer.
I don't think that these ink stains will come off.
I don't like mint tea.
What does Tom want to talk to me about?
Have you already started learning French?
I added Tom's family name to the list.
Do you find me pretty?
She will care for you from now on.
The United Nations Building was built in 1952.
She was absent from school because of sickness.
I can show you a better time.
I asked him to leave at once.
Do you trust her?
We're very grateful to you for all the help you've given us.
Do you like this garden?
It was nothing but a joke.
My father gave up smoking for his health.
I don't know the correct answer.
Their cattle are all fat.
Tom is used to speaking in public.
"I'm sorry, but I can't answer right away."
Were all of your children born in Australia?
I hope that I'm not disturbing you.
I love the sound of rain on the roof.
This may not be a real diamond.
I spent all day working yesterday.
It is probable that she will come.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
I like sleeping.
I found a pair of gloves under the chair.
Where's the restroom?
Do they take care of the dog?
This work is in the public domain in the United States.
I want to eat something that's not spicy.
He showed me his album.
I think it's unlikely that the next version of Windows will come out before the end of this month.
There's a huge hole in the wall.
I'm afraid it's going to take a bit more time.
The scholarship enabled him to study abroad.
Do I smell funny?
I've decided not to play tennis tomorrow.
How is the weather?
All I have is books.
We live in the country.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I have nothing to say about it.
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
He is walking towards the station.
I like the color orange.
Tom was in love.
She plans to break up with her boyfriend.
He's been teaching for 20 years.
I won't ask you anything else today.
I want us to get back together.
I'll check your vision.
I can't do that now.
He says he's got to get to Vienna the day after tomorrow.
Why do you hate yourself?
I learned it by heart.
What did you do today?
A stitch in time saves nine is a proverb.
We finished the job at noon.
Please fix the iron.
We can do it again another day.
Stay as long as you like.
That building is our school.
I am the tallest in our class.

He is not the coward that he was ten years ago.
This room is used by teachers.
The blossoms will be out in a few days.

I caught sight of her in the train.
We're all eager to know the truth.
Don't speak with your mouth full.
May I see the timetable?

I can't express myself in English very well.
I don't know what you're saying.
I'd like a glass of beer.
I need to get this done today.
Please mark the correct answer.
You should've told me that you wanted me to come alone.
I'll be more careful from now on.

I hope it won't be long before I hear from her.
Can we meet at the park?
The job must be finished by 3 p.m.

Tom took a short nap after lunch.
I'm smarter than you are.
He told me not to drive too fast.
Calm down!
Tom and Mary have been friends for three years.
Tom is wearing sunglasses.
It is too hot to work.
Tom was the only one who saw Mary sneak into the room.
How many times a week do you go shopping?
I had my hair cut at the barber shop yesterday.
He acquainted her with his plan.
I don't care for the way he talks.
We've run out of tea.
It's cold outside.
"How's your research coming along? ""Not so bad."""
Why is that?
I was able to do that without anyone's help.
I can't get by on such a small income.
Many hands make light work.
This meat has gone bad.
You'll hurt yourself if you're not careful.
He is carrying out experiments in his laboratory.
I wonder whether Tom kissed Mary goodnight last night.
My wife is obsessed with cleanliness.
I have no money with me.
Are you gonna help me or what?
It began to sprinkle.
"You should come, too."
In the middle of the village is a church.
What was Tom doing in there?
Could you please open the door?
The dog was dying.
Why did you buy such an expensive dictionary?
"Hold on a moment, please."
He tried hard only to find that he was not fit for the job.
Tom read it out loud.
Tom is incredibly bad at drawing.
Cherry blossoms are considered a symbol of Japan.
Are you going home?
Don't drop that glass.
Last night was unusually cold.

"Tom isn't angry with me, is he?"
Tom can run very fast.
I promise that I'll be here tomorrow.
Are you three good friends?
The children were barefoot.
"I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you."
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
I'll fix it now.
I like red roses.
Is Tom an actor?
There's something I forgot to tell you.
She's showing off.
Our flight was canceled.
Has your new novel already been translated into French?
Was Tom's room clean?
Please move your car out of here.
Everyone drank coffee afterwards.
Tom says he's depressed.
He is good for nothing.
Do you remember seeing me before?
"Check, please."
"He has two daughters, both married."
My father makes good use of his time.
Why won't you let us in?
He was exiled from his country.
"It was very cold, so we stayed at home."
"If you need anything, let me know."
What's the new teacher like?
I can't hear or see anything.
I will go out if it is fine tomorrow.
Her birthday party will be tomorrow evening.
I don't get along with him.
You have good reason to be angry.
Tom noticed the mistake right away.
I sometimes stutter.
You should be ashamed of your behavior.
Come and have a look at this.

"Romeo, believing that Juliet was dead, decided to kill himself."
Do you want to know who that woman is?
There are many old people in this village.
Haven't we met before?
Why do cats purr?
They have left school now.
It's my ship.
Steal the money.
"You're lying, aren't you?"
A green carpet will not go with this blue curtain.
I guess so.
It was a most beautiful flower.
I constantly quarrel with my wife.
My hobby is playing golf.
"When I woke up, it was snowing."
Everyone dreams.
Your pillow is dirty.
Can someone call security?
Mary is a mom.
This bus will take you to the airport.
I went there by bus and train.
You're a talented person.
He was calm in the presence of danger.
Please give Tom all these toys.
No one here knows my name.
We've been out of touch with each other for a long time.
That boy talks as if he were a grown up.
"I was very tired, but I was nevertheless unable to sleep."

I've never seen anyone do something like that before.
Consider it done.
I never saw him in jeans.
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence.
Tom said he was afraid of snakes.
I'll help you.
Tom taught me how to make an origami ninja star.
I forgot to buy a gift for you.
May I start eating now?
There's nothing in this box.
We bought new furniture.
He was all wrong.
I want to kiss you.
"May I use this pencil? ""Yes, you may."""
Do ghosts really exist?
I had my reasons.
"If you're going to do it, now's the time."

I found this book at a secondhand bookstore.
Do you want to rest?
I asked Tom where he'd like to go.
Do you think I'm crazy?
I have something I want to say to you.
He's the president of the bank.
We have breakfast at seven.
Could you tell me your name?
He has been waiting here some time.
When did you start dating?
I yawned.
Is it OK if I say it in French?
Italy isn't an island country.
I don't care as long as you're happy.
There's something strange happening.
I had to do everything alone.
These windows look to the south.
Tom is Mary's husband.
"Of course, I told him."
The ball hit the net.
"Recently what with anxiety and lack of sleep, she has lost almost ten pounds."
Salmon lay their eggs in fresh water.
It really has been a long time since we've seen each other.

Nobody answered my question.
Tom was working as an interpreter last summer.
Should I open the windows?
Do you have any money?
Are you at home?
What's written in the book?
What's the matter?
Tom is a French teacher.
A look of contentment appeared on his face.
Let's forget it for now.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
Why don't you go to school with us?
Clean up your room.
Italy isn't an island.
I ran into Mary at a party last week.
She thinks that she's always right.
"Keep up, Tom."
That's exactly my point.
She couldn't find her shoes.
Tom was in his junior year in college.
Maybe next time.
Did you put on sunscreen?
Let me in under your umbrella.
"Since there is no air on the moon, there is no sound at all."
"Why were 14,000 soldiers lost?"
Can't you hear anything?
"I waited for Tom and Mary, but they never came."
It's a two-hour drive from here to my uncle's house.
Can you zip up my dress?
People learn from experience.
I'm looking for an apartment in the center of town.
She gave me a watch for a birthday present.
Who is that man?
Use this.
Quite a few Americans like sushi.
I speak to my older brother in French and my younger brother in English.
Take it easy.
I should stop procrastinating.
Tom's dream is to go to Australia.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I was very confused by his questions.
How can I get to the train station?
"He has hardly any money, but he gets by."
What's the title of that book?
What do you think of the new Cabinet?
Do you think what she said is a lie?
My grandmother can fly.
Why did you sell your house?
I worry about your health.
Perhaps it will rain tomorrow.
You've changed. I didn't even recognize you at first.
I think Tom might have a drinking problem.
I want to buy the same car that Tom wants to buy.
Go to the end of the line.
You're irresistible.
Are there any problems we should know about?
We think that he will come.
I was late because of the traffic.
She sews with a needle and thread.
I thought you had a driver's license.
"We all searched high and low for the missing documents, but they were never found."
Is Tom retired?
I went to the police.
Tom and Mary planted a tree together.
I am ready.
I play piano.
I don't think this is funny.
The new law is expected to cut air pollution by 60%.
He is out now.
I may as well go now.
He survived his wife.
We are looking forward to seeing you and your family.
Do you know how to use this camera?
Would you mind coming with me?
You will have to join the project.
"Excuse me, could you say that again?"
Ten people were injured in the accident.
He addressed the crowd gravely.
The table doesn't take much room.
"If I'm wrong, let me know."
Tom disassembled the clock.
Is there enough sauce?
I studied French for three years.
I want facts.
We have a lot of snow at this time of the year.
What're you going to do this weekend?
You had better go to the dentist to have that tooth pulled out.
Give me another cup of tea.
Tom asked me out.
"As time went on, people grew less and less concerned about the matter."
"That's good enough, right?"
"Your ID, please."
I have been acquainted with her for more than 20 years.
Our oldest son's name is Tom.
It's up to you.
All roads lead to Rome.
My father seemed to be disappointed I hadn't passed the examination.
It is doubtful whether he did his homework by himself.
Will you go to the party tonight?
I put my pens in the drawer.
My father went to China.
Are you going to go to Tom's concert tomorrow night?
It seems a long way from here to the town.
Pain shot through his finger.
All men are equal.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
This room is for rent.
I walked for two hours in the afternoon heat.
I've decided to study French instead of English.
Tom isn't really good at tennis.
How does Tom know that?
Who were you talking with?
Are you absolutely sure?
French is easy.
My favorite song is Hungry Spider.
His decision to retire surprised all of us.
He has ants in his pants.
Tom certainly knew that what he was doing was illegal.
Will you be able to come?
I'll show you around the city.
Let's go downstairs.
There's no doubt about that.
Come and see us sometime.
She told us not to make a noise.
It's no use trying to persuade her.
She watched him dance.
It was raining on and off all through the night.
Please say hello to your family.
It would take forever for me to explain everything.
Have you ever traveled abroad?
"He's a British citizen, but he lives in India."
I saw a stranger enter that house.
Tom and I've been friends since kindergarten.
Tom knows he has no choice.
Stop being lazy and find something to do.
He is an authority on the humanities.
"If Tom doesn't get treatment soon, he'll die."
We put up at a small hotel just on the edge of the town.
"Could you lend me 10,000 yen?"
I had my wallet stolen on the bus.
"If something were wrong with my car, I'd go by bus."
You didn't call me.
I want to talk to Tom right now.
We live near the school.
A number of friends saw him off.
Come here quickly.
What people say is not always true.
I can't get my contacts out.
They were taken prisoner.
Tom doesn't seem to be very tired.
Wood burns.
She cried out the moment she saw her mother.
I'm waiting for him.
Can I extend my stay?
I have lots of things I need to do today.
My mother has just gone shopping.
It's at that counter.
Innocence is a beautiful thing.
What would you like to eat today?
I got my son to fix the door.
I didn't go to school today because I had a cold.
He was seized with fear.
I met Tom there.
I hope to see you again someday.
I have to take Tom to the hospital.
Would you mind my opening the door?
Tom tried to teach Mary how to swim.
Can you tell me how to get to the city hall?
"At first, I had no intention of taking over the family business."
Water my flowers while I'm away.
No one came to help me.
I have the day off.
Tom is Mary's friend.
Never tell me a lie again.
Are you taking your meds?
I can't bear the noise any longer.
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday.
"He was very tall and thin, with long arms and legs."
Are you really going to move to Boston?
Do come and see us again.
What's good.
I'm convinced Tom can win.
I'm from Australia.
That man sometimes says stupid things.
I'm like my father.
I'm feeling dizzy.
Find Tom.
You will be better off buying a new one than trying to fix it.
She was overcome with happiness.
"A few minutes more, and I'll be ready."
I don't have any money with me right now.
All the students passed the test.
I was 13 in 2003.
I missed my bus this morning.
How is the family doing?
My younger sister is famous.
"He promised to come, but he didn't come."
He just arrived.
My mother is making a cake for my father.
There is nothing for you to be afraid of.
The war affected the way the Japanese view nuclear weapons.
Tom isn't photogenic.
We're classmates.
Tom opened the door and the dog ran out.
Close the curtain.
I just want to stay here.
I'm very grateful to you.
Take it apart if necessary.
I don't dislike it.
Tom does that every Monday morning.
Don't tell anyone yet.
"If you need a pen, I'll lend you one."
Why don't you stay in Boston for a few more days?
What made her do so?
Existing legislation does not take diversity of races into account.
"When I lived in Boston, I often ate out."
Would you mind writing it down on this piece of paper?
It's fun to play cards.
Thank you for listening.
Prophets have been forecasting the end of the world for centuries.
I have an appointment with the dentist at 3 o'clock.
That's not original.

It isn't that far.

An hour's walk brought me to the next village.
Do Tom and Mary still live here?
Are there oak trees on the hill?
The export of arms was prohibited.
Can I take a break?
I'm frantic!
Who left the door open?
Watch closely.
You're a good girl.
I've got to go now.
Tom tested positive for COVID-19.
Don't tell lies.
The process is ongoing.
What are you all talking about?
Tom is a coach.
I'll look after that child.
The moon was shining brightly.
El Niño will continue.
It doesn't make sense to me.
How often do the buses run?
Our guests should be here within an hour.
Tom has three grown sons.
There are no broken bones.
No one went to the station to see him off when he left for Tokyo.
He is engaged in medical research.
Everyone loves him.
Today is hotter than yesterday.
That will put you in danger.
I broke my back.
I'm not really sure what to do.
I can swim across the river.
Is Tom in Boston?
Be careful not to catch a cold.
I didn't know you were a member.
Can you picture it?
Don't worry about it!
I have another appointment.
I hope that things work out for you.
We were granted the privilege of fishing in this bay.
Who is Tom?
How many times did you see the movie?
Let's pray.
You're reading too much into this.
My mother is busy cooking dinner.
Did you go somewhere this summer?
Has your new novel already been translated into French?
I usually put honey in my tea instead of sugar.
That cap is too small for me.
He is quite different from what he was ten years ago.
I was having dinner at the time.
I'm Tom's bodyguard.
I can't believe it's raining again.
It is too expensive.
I acknowledge my mistake.
These are our books.
He is doing his work.
Everybody was in a bad mood.
Have you ever eaten tomatoes with sugar?
We don't have a choice.
"Tom, it doesn't work that way."
I can't think of a reason not to go to the beach today.
You can see a house through the trees.
I'll never forget your kindness.
It's a tough question.
Your daughter is tall.
He asked for a cigarette.
Stop spending money on frivolous things.
I'll just cross that bridge when I come to it.
Save it on the external hard drive.
Tom took a lot of pictures in Boston.
Someone came.
Dinosaurs died out a very long time ago.
Tom was able to get there in less than twenty minutes.
Please let me know the status.
Tom put salt in his coffee instead of sugar.
"A bad habit, once formed, is difficult to get rid of."
I turn into a wolf at night.
I'm very concerned about her illness.
Tom obviously doesn't like Mary.
You could hear a pin drop in the room.
A team is composed of eleven players.
My sister asked my father to buy her a new bicycle.
This knife is dull.
I am acquainted with the author.
The president was sitting in the chair with his back to the window.
Let me fix the car.
He lives in the next town.
It's no good talking about it.
Why are you looking at us?
Do you like me?
It is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
Tom will turn thirty in October.
What do you remember about last night?
"If so, then there's no problem at all, is there?"
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
We're husband and wife.
Tom opened the box and peeked inside.
That's very difficult.
She is pursuing her career in interior design.
Did you know Tom is good at making coffee?
Keep mum about this plan.
I should've listened to my mother.
It is getting warmer and warmer.
Tom has to get his hair cut.
The cat ran up the tree.
I lost three kilograms.
Are you still nauseous?
Tom wore a parka.
This cookie is delicious.
My legs ached after the long walk.
Thanks for the explanation.
Let's never grow up.
Please promise you'll never do that again.
That kind of person will fail for sure.
The three neighbors helped each other.
Tom is an early bird.
Long skirts are out of fashion now.
I think Tom lied to Mary.
He's good at swimming.
Are you ready for the trip?
This guidebook might be of use to you on your trip.
Tom translated the letter from French into German.
Call me when you're ready.
Tom makes up stories all the time.
Both windows were broken.
What do you do in your spare time?
I'd like to become a teacher.
Last week I ate pizza every day.
Don't pour hot water into the glass or it will crack.
I'm amazed at Tom's rapid progress in French.
Can one of you call Tom?
"Global warming can cause serious problems for wild animals, too."
Do it yourself.
I can drive.
The leaves of the trees began to turn red.
I have something good to tell you.
This is not true.
What have you been up to?
I'll take it.
Nobody asked me any questions.
Are you joking?
Summers are hot in Japan.
Did he tell you what to do?
I have got to leave here early tomorrow morning.
Food is still scarce in the region.
Tom speaks relatively fast.
That's not mine.
I'm sure you're tired.
How many hours does it take to drive from Boston to Chicago?
The wind calmed down.
Never press this button.
Are you cops?
Yesterday I spent the whole day working.
We all have a duty to fulfill.
I have a dictionary right here.
His wife is one of my friends.
She's digging her own grave.
I'd like to learn more about this.
I'll call you at seven.
The airplane climbed sharply.
Take her to the hospital.
Would you give me some time to think about it?
I'd like to open a bank account.
"You're forgetful, aren't you?"
How are we going to solve this problem?
You should think about your future.
It's the oldest wooden building in existence.
A child today would not do that.
Where's the checkout counter?
I'd rather walk than wait for a bus.
He is writing a novel.
Tom and Mary got married this spring.
Where are you going?
We have four seasons in Japan.
There is little furniture in my room.
Tom was a picky eater when he was a kid.
"You're a Canadian, right?"
How long do butterflies live?
Are you still going to buy a car?
What time is breakfast served?
I don't want to drive.
I often played tennis when I was young.
"Pass the sugar, please."
Many criminals in America are addicted to drugs.
Are those guys from your school?
Tom is ignoring me.
We're neighbors.
He is well read in English literature.
Do you want to say something?
My father objected to my traveling alone.
"Are these all your books, Tom?"
"I'd never say it this way, but I can understand the intended meaning."
"While I was waiting for the streetcar, I witnessed a traffic accident."
I think that Tom and Mary are both ticklish.
How about a walk?
Tom can't walk.
Is Tom successful?
Tom kept crying.
Go home now.
Do it by all means.
He is dead drunk.
The train pulled out exactly on time.
I can't calculate the distance.
I'm afraid that place is a little too expensive.
"When I see people eating hayashi rice, I want to eat it myself."
Which of them is your brother?
I'll be back within an hour.
You can see the island in the distance.
Are you really going to go to Boston by yourself?
A special tax was imposed on imported cars.
I left you a message.
I can't wait to see you.
They are in the kitchen.
No one can do two things at the same time.
Everyone believed what Tom said.
Tom stopped what he was doing.
"It's windy today, isn't it?"
Put the book back where it was.
Please say hello to your wife.
The roof is really in need of repair.
What's it like?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Tom was sitting at the table.
He came to see me during my absence.
Tom isn't afraid of anything.
Tom can only speak French.
I like watching sunsets.
It probably won't work anymore.
I sat down next to him.
He is hard to deal with.
There are some apples in the basket.
He came in spite of the heavy snow.
Where is the railway station?
I want to watch TV.
The rest is left to you.
"When his wife died, he received dozens of letters of sympathy."
"Do I have to go, too?"
She isn't afraid of death.
We have a little time before the next train.
Tom kicked Mary.
All I have is one book.
Drink something.
Tom loves zoos.
This is a real popular item.
I ate a large dinner and felt satisfied.
He hesitated before answering.
Mary wore a strapless dress.
She has two cats. One is white and one is black.
I heard that from Tom.
Why are you sad?
Read this book.
He asked if I liked Chinese food.
Why is the train so crowded today?
Tom is the guy Mary has been dating.
I politely turned down his offer and hung up.
"Last night, I saw something."
Where have you been all this while?
I ought to have attended the lecture.
What're you doing here?
I'm off beer.
I wish we had a car.
I have never eaten a mango before.
My sister and I are different in every way.
Is this red wine?
I think it's faster to get to school by train than by bus.
I had difficulty in solving this problem.
Illness prevented me from coming to school.
"Generally speaking, Americans like coffee."
You have beautiful hair.
I don't have any money.
Are you two hungry?
This is a poisonous mushroom.
Will you tell me how to get to your house?
I ran over a cat.
Help me take this down.
He doesn't have any friends.
I had him wash the car.
Mary can speak French almost as well as she can speak English.
Our school begins at eight-thirty.
Close your mouth.
He's in bed with the flu.
It's not so hot anymore.
The child got on the airplane in a good mood.
I don't have time to read books.
I give you my word not to tell anyone about it.
These shoes are too small.
It will snow tomorrow.
Tom stayed home to care for his sick mother.
Can you please open the window?
"My father makes it a rule to get up at six, even in the winter."
It's time to go to bed.
What's your mother tongue?
"It doesn't matter who says that, it's not true."
This is a list of things that have to be done by Monday.
Do you like baseball?
This custom began in the Edo Period.
Is this a new rule?
That will save me a lot of trouble.
Tom lived in the center of Boston.
You may spend a maximum of 100 dollars.
"I do not like tea, so I generally drink coffee for breakfast."
Did you know he bought a condominium?
I ate a lot.
I hear a strange sound.
Don't drink too much before going to bed.
Is it true Tom has a twin?
I don't mind if it's hot and spicy.
I'm from America.
Tom left on Monday.
Can't you come to Australia this year?
I think Tom likes Mary.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
Who wrote the letter?
That's a good plan.
The question is not so much what it is as how it looks.
Can we stay just a bit longer?
It snowed all day.
They saw him enter the room.
Only one little boy survived the traffic accident.
I'd appreciate it if you would turn off the lights.
I asked him what his name was.
I couldn't think of anything.
Let's talk turkey.
He hurried to the station.
I don't feel like watching TV tonight.
Tom usually takes a shower before breakfast.
I will stay at home.
The train was so crowded that we were obliged to stand all the way to Osaka.
I agreed with him on that point.
Don't drink too much.
It's a pleasant day.
Kyoto is famous for its shrines and temples.
Children grow up very fast.
It is easy to play tennis.
"If it rains tomorrow, we'll stay at home."
Come at once.
Come home.
You can't count on their help.
My father is always busy.
The old man freed the little fox from the trap.
The crowd buzzed with excitement.
What did you eat for breakfast?
I could tell at a glance that something was wrong.
I ran across a rare book in a secondhand bookstore.
I have a driver's license.
"Meanwhile, night had fallen."
Tom answered Mary's question.
"Can somebody help me? ""I will."""
Don't show off.
Do you really think that I'm that gullible?
A tall man came up to me.
When did you get back?
Do you have any day tours?
Tom stayed home to care for his sick mother.
I need to take a shower.
Where can I obtain a map of Europe?
"Which do you prefer, dogs or cats?"
I married off my daughter.
I told the truth.
Why did you think that?
"Tom, you look very sleepy."
Nobody died.
Tom eats at least three bowls of rice every day.
You should make good use of your time.
Tom didn't expect to win the race.
I've never seen snow before.
All you have to do is clean your room.
Our teacher separated us into two groups.
Is there anything else I can do?
Are you sure you remember everything?
He may not be happy.
There was no response to my question.
She happened to have the day off.
You can turn on the heater if you're cold.
Please give me some money.
I know someone who can speak French.
He has plenty of money in the bank.
"Today, I just feel like staying at home and doing nothing."

How many books do you think you've read so far?
"So what do you think, Tom?"
"No pain, no gain."
It smelled really good.
Why are you wearing a tux?
"We've considered your proposal, and we've decided that we aren't able to reduce the price."
He's used to speaking in public.
The meeting planned for today has been canceled.
She wanted to go out anyway.
He rang me up at midnight.
Might I ask your name?
I don't fear death.
How long does it take to walk to the station?
He went on doing it.
We'll have to shovel the snow off the roof.
Is his father a doctor?
That isn't important to me.
It's obvious that you're wrong.
You don't have to say it.
When can you do it?
Tom has perfect pitch.

"If you like Tom so much, why not break up with me and date him?"
The road is too narrow for cars.

They're jealous.
I can't help crying.
How about some more roast beef?
Don't worry. It's easy.
I knew you'd get here in time.
She came last.
Is it OK to take pictures here?
Pneumonia causes difficulty in breathing.
Come over here and sit down.
I need coffee.
I have nothing in common with her.
I didn't have the sense to do so.
Tom didn't know how to do that.
How was your trip?
You are free to leave any time you wish.
Her eyes were filled with tears.
There are many things we need to discuss.
How do you earn your living?
I have something to do tomorrow.

Are you a high school student?
Did you enjoy yourself at the party?
He's a big liar.
I couldn't catch what he said.
Catch him.
Can we have a talk?
I don't think that anyone else could do my job.
We have lots of snow in the winter.
"I know that Tom doesn't like me, but I don't care."
I'd like to hear the whole story.
We set up our tents before dark.
You hypocrite!
We won't fire Tom.

Please contact me later.
See you tomorrow in the library.
She left France for the United States.
Tom isn't an interpreter.

Don't treat me like a child.
Who on earth are you?
This is the school where my father used to go.
I'm getting bored.
I asked him for his name.

It's your special day.
We want to remain like this.
We are finally free.
She is now eighty-one years old.
What horrible weather!
This money is for a rainy day.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
"You're Tom, aren't you?"
I have so many things to do.
Take me to the hospital.
The teacher will get angry for sure.
I inherited my father's property.
Tom had a good reason for not paying his rent on time.
It took me three hours to finish it.
We crossed the road.
Tom has a big brother.
What people say isn't always true.
The truth is I told a lie.
I can't understand what you said at all.
He is good at tennis.
Tom has gone to Boston.
It's not as hard as you think.
He's accustomed to traveling.
I thought you liked playing with me.
Tom picked flowers.
Birds sometimes cause accidents by getting in the way of airplanes.
I went in the direction my friend indicated.
That child threw a stone at the dog.
You'll miss the train.
The meeting is held annually.
Tokyo is the largest city in Japan.
I'll do it at home.
I wish I were a prince.
Tom isn't welcome here.
I'm innocent.
"No matter how hard I try, I can't remember how to do it."
She must have known that she had a cancer.
The food was so good that I ate too much.
I was eating some strawberries.
Tell them thanks.
I like studying wild flowers.
What would Tom say?
I opened the box and looked inside.
Give me that laptop.
Do you really want to move downtown?
This is a picture of an airport.
"To tell the truth, I hate the very sight of him."
Even an expert driver can make a mistake.
"Office managers expect accuracy, efficiency, and dedication."
I'm begging you. Don't make me laugh. I did too many sit-ups yesterday and my stomach muscles hurt.
None of your business.
The eager spectators crowded into the stadium.
Do you usually travel alone?
This rug is handmade.
Flies are insects.
I want to be a computer programmer.
The register was empty.
I failed to recall the song's title.
I don't have much money on me.
Everyone was drunk.
I could hardly understand him.
He has taken to drinking recently.
Tom has over three million dollars deposited in that bank.
Honesty is not always the best policy.
Mary's dress was cheap.
Where are you going?
I can't hold it anymore.
She went out to do her chores.
The government issued the following statement.
I had instant noodles as a midnight snack.
Where's the toilet?
Don't hesitate to ask your teacher a question.
Nobody was injured.
I hope the weather stays this way.
I didn't laugh.
My phone is in my pocket.
Do you have money for a ticket?
This money isn't mine.
It's fun to play baseball.
You should've kept your mouth shut.
He saw a UFO flying last night.
I think I've caught a cold.
This melody is known to many Japanese people.
I can't afford to buy all the things I want.
She is qualified as a nurse.
Was Tom surprised to see Mary?
Thank you for doing the cooking while I was sick in bed.
She was homesick.
I want to play poker.
I live in Tokyo.
Watch your step.
My sister Mary is now in Boston.
Do you really believe I killed my brother?
The view is breathtaking.
Look! There's a cat in the kitchen.
Can you pick me up?
They're right behind me.
We played together when we were kids.
My mother put a large vase on the shelf.
My name is Tom.
The dog was sleeping on the mat.
I want warm water.
His house is across from mine.
She turned pale at the news.
We couldn't go out because of the rain.
I'll give you anything but this.
I thought that Tom was a veterinarian.
The room had a nice cozy feel.
Mary is a tomboy.
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
I forgot that today was April Fool's Day.
You'll get there in less than ten minutes.
Please repair the car.
"If you push this button, the door will open."
"Tom is shorter than me, isn't he?"
If only the rain would stop.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's behavior.
I don't have the time or the money to take a trip.
He acted like he owned the place.
It was so hot that I slept with the window open.
I live on the bottom floor.
Can you show me the way?
How about doing that together?
I want to buy a house.
It's such a nice day. Why don't you take me for a drive?
The workers pushed for a raise in salary.
Cheese doesn't digest easily.
I want this shirt.
We should have been more careful.
Are you going to buy that or not?
He hung a lamp from the ceiling.
I'd like to get a medical examination for my two-year-old daughter.
I like pop music.
I'd like to buy a dozen donuts.
I think it's OK.
This is the bathroom.
Your pulse is normal.
What are you into these days?
I went to bed at twelve last night.
Tom bought me a book.
I'm happy to see you again.
We carry out treatments like whitening. We also do tobacco stain removal and other cleaning procedures.
She has a sharp tongue.
I'm going out for lunch.
He looks old for his age.
Drive carefully.
I was dumbfounded.
Are you allergic to any foods?
I stole a car.
"Hey, has this been sitting out on the dinner table all day? It has to go in the refrigerator or it'll go bad."
I hate hypocrisy.
She was about to go out.
It feels like I've seen her before.
Only Tom left.
I'm a genius.
Quit sniffling and blow your nose.
"Tom was sitting at his desk, drawing a picture."
I can't believe Tom is getting married.
Be careful what you say when Tom is around.
The cost of living is very high in Tokyo.
I don't have enough money to buy everything I want to buy.
Tom doesn't really like cats.
The car broke down on the way to the airport.
Tom complained about the exam.
I don't understand British humor.
There are lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance.
Have you ever climbed a mountain?
Will you give me some?
Let me give you an example.
A man with a big dog came in.
He kept on working all the while.
He played the part of Hamlet.
Don't lump me in with them.
It is very hot today.
How much is a round-trip ticket?
Is that mouse dead or alive?
I gave my seat to the old lady.
He helped me move.
Is the university's library open now?
I'll be staying here for three months.
I work in a call center.
Why on earth did Tom do that again?
"In Japan, school starts in April."
It looks like Tom is drunk again.
I don't enjoy tennis.
This arouses my curiosity.
"Weather permitting, I'll depart tomorrow."
Tom noticed a wedding ring on Mary's finger.
"In 1997, the world was surprised again when Mother Teresa died."
You look pretty young.
I borrowed three books from the library.
My friend was arrested for speeding.
I know that Tom is afraid of us.
I advised him not to drive.
He often stays up late at night.
Does anybody know if the cafeteria is still open?
Please help me prepare the food.
I want to be with you.
Could you give me a lift to the train station?
Little children like to touch everything.
I thought you had a driver's license.
I'm quite hungry.
I have to leave today.
Do you really think Tom is overweight?
Tom just sat there looking bored.
Are they all the same price?
"How did you two meet? ""It's a long story."""
"How soon will the bus come? ""In five minutes."""
How many minutes does it take to get to the station by taxi?
The countdown has begun.
Tom and Mary are the ones who broke the window yesterday.
I'm almost done.
Can I ask you something?
"Time goes by very quickly, doesn't it?"
She sews with a needle and thread.
I prefer reading to writing.
I really respect you.
When must I turn in the report?
He used to be a quiet man.
I'm glad I was there.
Is the university library open now?
That's hard to say.
"You like older women, don't you?"
I thought that Tom might be hungry.
I'm afraid I can't stay for long.
Please take a seat.
Be serious.
Mary and I have been acquainted with each other for many years.
This is the best camera in the store.
A fly is an insect.
I had my hands full taking care of my own children.
His knees gave way.
Let's go out for some ramen.
Please let me off here.
How did you know his name wasn't Tom?
You really did a good job.
Show me another watch.
Thanks for coming over tonight.
Tom asked Mary's advice about the problem.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
He looks tired.
The odds of this team winning are next to none.
I love opera.
Is the post office still closed?
I didn't realize my wallet was missing until I got home.
Tom's deaf.
Come to my office.
Who's eaten the cheese?
I arrived at the bus stop just after the bus left.
I fear this work will take up most of my time.
Let's help each other.
He dozed off even though he didn't want to.
It's obvious you're wrong.
Who was this poem written by?
Tom had a strange dream.
I love trips.
I'm just a plain old office worker.
Can you please close that window?
"You can go out, as long as you promise to be back by 11 o'clock."
Tom doesn't like to travel.
The train was delayed due to the typhoon.
You'd best follow the doctor's advice.
I need to learn a new song.
I have to rinse my mouth.
A dead leaf fell to the ground.
"If not you, then who?"
My car broke down on the way to the airport.
People lie.
"A nice room, isn't it?"
Is that blood?
You'd better write Tom a letter.
Where are my glasses?
Mary is the woman of my dreams.
I was hungry.
I have a feeling you'll be a very good lawyer.
What do you say to going for a drive now?
You'll have to get off at the next station.
They didn't tell me so.
"Suddenly, it started to rain."
I think Tom is pessimistic.
I want your answer by the end of the day.
Not all Canadians are tall.
My mother likes tea very much.
The house is on top of the hill.
What did you put into the box?
I'm the tallest in our class.
The view is wonderful.
My uncle is coming to see us tomorrow.
Tom has gotten fatter.
I am thinking of getting it translated into English.
Where were you today?
Tom has no brother.
Tom disregarded Mary's advice completely.
"Tom was able to do that, but Mary wasn't."
Someone stole my bag.
You'd better keep your money for a rainy day.
Rainy season has begun.
Tom didn't know what to say.
I sprained my ankle.
Up to now I've never been abroad.
They feared you.
"Weather permitting, let's go on a picnic."
My stomach hurts.
I wish my parents would let me stay up later at night.
Do you know the way home?
I used to often go skiing in the winter.
This car won't start.
I don't think I have time to do that this morning.
"It's OK to be scared, Tom."
I really love flowers.
Are you sure that it's a centipede?
Why did Tom need to do that?
"I'm in debt to my uncle for $10,000."
Don't have anything to do with him. He is completely untrustworthy.
I'm getting off at the next station.
This is a map of Australia.
Leave the chairs as they are.
Tom asked his father if he could go to a movie.
Give my thanks to your son.
Tom knows that he doesn't have much choice.
There's no one in the room.
I heard Tom sneeze.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.
A man shouldn't be a pastor until he's in his forties.
I stopped drinking coffee.
This adds to my troubles.
Who's the girl sitting next to Tom?
What time do you have dinner?
Black looks good on you.
"What would you like? ""I would like a dog."""
Two from ten leaves eight.
"Coffee, please, with cream and sugar."
The question is whether Tom will agree with us.
Tom walked around the room.
I didn't know he had decided to leave his job.
I didn't understand what the writer was trying to say.
Sheep were grazing in the meadow.
That movie is for adults.
We need somebody with bold new ideas.
Tom is a yes-man.
I used to get sick a lot when I was a kid.
My mother bought me a pretty dress this past Sunday.
I don't think being poor is anything to be ashamed of.
Children don't like to take a bath.
I don't know how to say that in French.
Are you positive?
Please hand in the report by the end of the month.
I got my hair cut.
Cookie is Tom's dog.
I wish I had a car.
I take back everything I've said.
What's this button for?
Tom will never change.
How far is it from the airport to the hotel?
I do work related to computers.
The view from the mountain top was spectacular.
Man has a great capacity to adapt to environmental changes.
I take a nap almost every day.
Please write down your contact information here.
Can I use my credit card?
Put your books in order.
I can wait for you.
Are you leaving soon?
He was involved in a traffic accident.
I had an unexpected experience.
"I tried to open the door, but it wouldn't open."
Could I borrow a pencil?
I'd do anything to help you both.
We had bad weather yesterday.
Tom is quite happy.
Do you have a dog?
That has nothing to do with you.
I thought that you liked being alone.
"Finally, it's Friday."
You can get to the station by bus.
I haven't eaten meat for a whole month.
Water makes up most of the earth's surface.
I've never heard the kind of stories he tells.
When will you be free?
I don't think that he's honest.
How do you interpret this poem?
I met Tom in October.
"Which shirt do you like more, the red one or the blue one?"
I'll make you happy.
They fed a black and a white dog.
What have you been up to lately?
The person sitting next to me started talking to me.
The teacher dismissed his class when the bell rang.
My sister got married in her teens.
This is not enough.
Leave it to me.
Do whatever you like.
My father decided to quit smoking.
Did you forget to wax the floor again?
I think it won't succeed.
She sat on the bench.
What do you want to do?
Tom is always smiling.
Let's eat out tonight.
We are looking forward to seeing you and your family.
I got a new jacket yesterday.
Tom found the keys that he thought he'd lost.
Give me a break here.
The soldiers are exhausted.
"He hasn't done badly, all in all."
Where's your grandmother?
"I'm sorry, I dialed the wrong number."
The door was locked from within.
Does Tom think he's funny?
This is a bit vague.
My father makes good use of his time.
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
One of us is going to have to leave.
I just wanted to play baseball.
What's your blood type?
I take a walk with my dog in the evening.
Were you here last night?
I want to rent an apartment with two rooms.
Don't worry. Didn't I say that everything would go well?
"The more I try to forget about my ex-boyfriend, the more I think about him."
It's not Tom's fault.
I'm still feeling a little homesick and so many things seem strange to me.
We accepted his offer.
I think that it's OK.
Our policy is to satisfy our customers.
That's OK.
He soon walked away.
He didn't know what to say.
When did she promise to meet him?
Roll over on your back.
What's your phone number?
She attends school at night.
The work will take anywhere from two to three weeks.
Does Tom speak French?
What he said turned out to be a lie.
Please lower your voice.
He enjoys watching baseball games on TV.
Everything has its limit.
Behave yourself.
He seems to be friendly.
"Had I known the truth, I would have told it to you."
We had a lot of fun.
Stop that!
I'll be sixteen years old next month.
I'm really starting to get worried.
Lock the door.
I don't have any more cheese.
Tom forgot to ask Mary what he had planned to ask her.
How come you didn't come to the party?
It is our custom to take off our shoes when we enter the house.
Tom kissed Mary on both cheeks.
Tom bought a new camera.
I'm dying for a cold drink.
Tom is really angry.
My stomach hurts.
Tom speaks English with a strong French accent.
Is this accurate?
They weren't invited.
Don't go too far away.
I want to join the army.
Turn right at the second corner.
Pandas live in bamboo thickets.
Tom was dying of thirst.
Insects are attracted to light.
Do you happen to have any photographs of Tom?
Shut up and listen!
Didn't you see that?
Do you like robots?
I'm not dead yet.
"To make a long story short, he married his first love."
This book is worth reading over and over again.
I need somebody to help me.
Where were you?
I'm almost ready.
I had just finished eating lunch when my doorbell rang.
I bought a book about animals.
I have an appointment with the doctor.
Life would be empty without Tom.
Life without love has no meaning.
The cost of living has increased drastically.
We still have things we have to do.
The next station is where you get off.
"If I had bought the painting then, I would be rich now."
It's odd.
Tom came on Monday and went back home the next day.
Is Tom living in Australia?
Don't walk on the grass.
Let's do that at Tom's house.
I am putting on weight these days.
He didn't say a single word.
Aren't you happy?
How about a cup of cocoa?
Have you lost your mind?
She must still be in her twenties.
Tell me what you are doing.
"I'm sorry, did you say something?"
Don't take it so hard!
Who paid for the ticket?
Tom is traveling in Australia.
I'm often mistaken for my younger brother.
"I speak Japanese, English, and French."
Get going.
Listen carefully to what I say.
Don't you want to know what's wrong?
Where have you traveled?
I enjoyed swimming in the river.
I have just finished eating.
There is no time to lose.
"I like Tom, but he doesn't like me."
"My father gave me a watch, but I lost it."
I'm the fastest runner.
I've been to the supermarket.
Do you know what the time is?
That's enough.
I want to quit my current job.
"She can speak English, of course."
I didn't understand what it meant.
He turned the key.
She knows everything about cooking.
It's a matter of the utmost importance.
They cheered.
My mom gets up early every morning.
He felt uneasy in his father's presence.
Cut the cheese into thin slices or into little cubes.
I was bitten by a zombie.
The damage is done.
There are lots of things for us to think about.
"Don't refer to this matter again, please."
The government has imposed a new tax on wine.
I was really tired so I went to bed early.
You have to eat.
You're the best man for the job.
Don't wait for me for dinner.
Tom and Mary are waiting outside.
Baby lions are cute.
Lincoln was elected President in 1860.
Today is my little sister's birthday.
I didn't know what to do then.
It looks like rain.
Did you show those pictures to your friends?
Tom had a weird dream last night.
Can such a thing happen again?
Is Tom going to get out of prison any time soon?
We had fish for dinner last night.
Tom is a systems engineer.
She promised me that she would come at three.
I'm undressing.
I want to be your wife.
Tom gave a sigh.
May I interrupt you a while?
He advocated abolishing class distinctions.
We've just spent two weeks apart.
I ran like lightning.
Tom is watching TV.
"If he doesn't accept the job, someone else will."
Tom's novel has been translated into French.
Many of my neighbors have persimmon trees.
The children are riding the carousel.
I received a letter from him to the effect that he could not accept my offer.
Tom is very methodical in the way he does his work.
"If it isn't one thing, it's another."
He's looking good.
We're boys.
I agree with Tom.
We had a rough flight because of turbulence.
I'm a prisoner.
I went there dozens of times.
Does that bus have air conditioning?
I showed her my room.
Please show me how to use the headset.
Tom got good at tennis.
I never thought that it'd be this hard to create an iPad app.
I met her in the store by accident.
There's a bear outside.
Tom started dating an older woman.
That hurts.
It took a long time for Japanese imports to penetrate the American consumer markets.
My middle name is Tom.
"Honey, I love you."
"Do you love me? ""I don't know."""
I trained the dog to do tricks.
Will you go on foot or by bus?
My younger brother is taller than me.
Last night I had a strange dream.
I don't know whether I have time or not.
What time does it open?
You should listen.
Tom is still unconscious on the floor.
He is intelligent.
Everyone burst into laughter.
"If it hadn't been for the storm, we would've arrived sooner."
"Tom is tall, isn't he?"
Tom came into my room without knocking.
You should have told it to me sooner.
There is no time to lose.
"What do you think, doctor?"
I have bad eyes.
"I'm at work now, so I'll call you later."
Tom could no longer hide his fear.
That isn't exactly what I said.
Which is your bag?
We cannot put up with their rudeness any longer.
All thirty people on board died.
I was too embarrassed to look her in the eye.
I got up an hour earlier than I usually do.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
My mom would like to meet you.
Don't let yourself get tricked so easily.
Tom is always smiling.
Put away your toys.
I'm glad the thief was caught.
Tom teaches at a university.
Everything you need is here.
Do you accept Visa card?
This is too big for one person to carry.
I was kept waiting nearly half an hour.
Mt. Fuji is the highest mountain in Japan.
You can put it here.
Come talk with me.
How much is this racket?
Tom is not a liar.
She bowed to me politely.
What was your day like?
Let's pretend we're aliens.
He acknowledged his fault.
Please remember to mail the letter.
I eat vegetables and fruit every morning.
Someone is at the front door.
She cried.
Is nicotine as addictive as heroin?
I'm not able to swim.
What did you see at that time?
She didn't show up.
Tom is home.
I often hiccup.
I went to bed right after dinner.
The light turned red.
You must do your duty.
It'll probably rain tomorrow.
I can hardly swim.
"Right now, we're eating dinner."
You've done it!
Did I pronounce your name correctly?
What time do you arrive tomorrow?
I know Tom is shorter than me.
He rejected my offer flatly.
Nobody lives in this house.
The Tokaido Line was crippled by the typhoon.
"The average of 3, 4 and 5 is 4."
I've translated several books into French.
He gets up at seven.
Tom bought a box of cookies for Mary.
Tom is an old student of mine.
All at once they began to laugh.
What time will we reach Akita if we take the 9:30 train?
You shouldn't act selfishly.
No student went to the party.
He acted like he owned the place.
I don't want to talk with Tom.
Thank you.
"It being a fine day, I went out for a walk."
I will give it to you.
It is cold outdoors. Put on your coat.
Tom forwarded the email he received from Mary to John.
How can I get in touch with you?
Was Tom here yesterday?
"Thanks to translation tools, I often visit websites in other countries."
I'm glad I make you happy.
Do you need the key?
She doesn't have any enemies at all.
Please call me a taxi.
The story got more and more exciting.
Nobody came to the party.
I knew what the problem was.
I pointed my camera at her.
I made a lot of money on the side.
This amount includes tax.
I caught a head cold.
Don't come here.
Tom lives next door to me.
My older brother takes a shower every day.
We must always be prepared for the worst.
Convenience stores are more expensive than supermarkets.
This is my mother's.
He went to the United States to study English.
I received a warm welcome.
Watch out!
Fire is dangerous.
The moon has come out.
Do you really love me?
How did you obtain this painting?
My mother is always very cheerful in spite of poor health.
Her father died when she was three.
Close your eyes.
I have left you your dinner in the oven.
Has anyone ever said that you wear too much makeup?
I know that the person in the next room is either Tom or Mary.
I want to open my own restaurant.

Tom dances.
Are you free this afternoon?
Are my socks dry yet?
That's the tallest tree that I've ever seen.
Is today a bad day?

My car is covered with pigeon poop.
"When did you return? ""I came back the day before yesterday."""
What do you feel like eating?
I read that book while I was in the hospital.
"For reasons unknown, sales have increased."
We've had lots of typhoons this fall.
I want you to send this parcel at once.
It's almost summer.
It's about 30 minutes from here on foot.
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow.
How are dogs and wolves different?
Have you eaten your lunch yet?
I just don't want to go shopping today.
I'm disappointed that my friend isn't here.
We went to see a movie with my friend yesterday.
I weighed myself on the bathroom scales.
I've finished my assignment.
I'm going to wait outside.
I want a lot of them.
Is this real silk?
I got you some ice cream.
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
Will you take a personal check?
"Hey, don't blame me. I'm just the messenger."
Drive carefully.
I think we shouldn't do that.
Tom works in a coffee shop.
My uncle gave me an hourglass.
They must've skipped out of town.
Tom was caught cheating on the exam and was expelled from school.
Can I buy only the lenses?
Can I have this film developed?
How about making me a cup of tea?
"Of course, you can look at it."
I can't hear well.
A government official's stately mansion was looted.
Are you making Tom a sandwich?
I have not heard from you. I was wondering if maybe my mail never got to you.
Thank you for the explanation.
He's the most likely to succeed.
Tom often sits in front of his computer all day.
She's on a diet.
We talked about various topics.
She loves him.
That house is haunted.
It has finally stopped snowing and has warmed up.
I don't recall.
Is the watch on the table?
You shouldn't expect things to be easy.
It wasn't premeditated.
What did you plant in your garden this year?
I can't figure out what she really wants.
Don't let go of the rope until I tell you that it's OK to do so.
The assignment is due two weeks from today.
A lot of people in Africa go hungry.
Read the bottom of the page.
"We're good friends now, but we didn't like each other at first."
Are you going to buy that car?
Let's wait for a while and see how you do.
It's OK with me.
I have a little money.
I don't think that Tom is right.
All the apples are here.
Is Tom missing?
Buffaloes have big horns.
Could you break this ten dollar bill?
Put your scarf on. It's cold out.
TV programs have a bad influence on children.
The rapid growth of the city surprised us.
I forgot to add that to my list.
I think we should lower the price.
I'll visit you tomorrow.
Happiness can't be bought.
I don't understand the lyrics of this song at all.
I wonder if Tom would know how to do this.
"She loves chocolate, too."
I'd like to stay for a few days.
Tom did that once.
"Go, before I change my mind."
I couldn't find her anywhere.
Tom is a talented hockey player.
He is going to stay at a friend's house.
It must've been broken during shipping.
He is able to speak Japanese.
I walk in the forest every day.
Japan is famous for its scenic beauty.
How much will it cost to get to the airport?
"The population of the city is about 100,000."
Tom isn't good with basic arithmetic.
Don't come back here again.
It's not funny.
We feel very safe here.
It's really dark outside. I wonder if a storm is coming.
I might be a genius.
His wife comes from California.
Do you think I'm ugly?
I would just like to thank all of you for your work.
Does your dog bite?
Tom said that he thought Mary would be absent.
A swarm of hornets attacked the children.
This dress fits me very well.
Don't be deceived.
He is adept at telling lies.
I can scarcely believe it.
The news quickly spread.
I want more detailed information.
I think I need braces.
She was in a great hurry.
Mary isn't really sick. She's only pretending to be.
Tom is lonely.
This story is too complex for children.
It's my business to investigate such things.
Does anyone have some moisturizing cream?
Turn the light on. I can't see anything.
Tom exercises.
It's not true.
I haven't been to Boston since October.
The prices are subject to change without notice.
I'm studying French.
He's studying now.
Is the rent here expensive?
I'm too tired to walk any further.
This history book is written for high school students.
They differed with each other on the care and upbringing of their children.
I got a lot of mail this morning.
Tom has been helping me.
I saw a huge octopus while scuba diving yesterday.
My mirror broke.
I don't feel like talking.
Tom is going there next week.
The function of the heart is to pump blood.
She kissed him.
"You don't need to speak to Tom in sign language, because he can read lips really well."
My sister became a college student.
I know that Tom is mad.
Don't leave the water running.
Tom is looking at the pictures that Mary sent him.
Do I have to do it right away?
Let's go out for dinner tonight.
The train's here.
I drink a glass of milk before going to bed.
No one knows what'll happen in the future.
Tom and I are both drunk.
The townspeople looked curiously at me.
I'll do the shopping for you.
This will take a lot of time.
I never drink.
He embezzled public money.
Where is the nearest church?
I've never been this sick before.
I'm a college student.
You're my enemy.
Please lend me your knife.
I thought Tom was studying.
You are very beautiful.
We went swimming at the beach.
Is she here yet?
The average height of girls in this class is over 155 centimeters.
You may give this photograph to anyone who wants it.
This dictionary is as useful as yours.
I'll be working on my report all day tomorrow.
Tom used to hang out here.
I thought that something was strange.
Tom thought that he was smarter than Mary.
Tom said that it probably wouldn't take too much time.
Have you quit smoking?
Can you think of anything else?
China is rich in natural resources.
"If it were me, I wouldn't move to Australia."
One is blue.
There is no hope of his recovery.
Tom wants to go to college.
Let me handle this.
I never got along with Tom.
Never trust a stranger.
It's located very near the station.
"Tom is really good at this, isn't he?"
We'll someday make the world a better place.
My mom bought me this toy when I was 8.
Who spilled the soda?
I have a doctor's appointment.
The can is empty.
Keep your voice down.
Tell me about your girlfriend.
He had dark brown hair.
"If by any chance he comes, I'd like you to give him this paper."
Did you really call in sick?
"Turn the light on, please."
Can Tom read and write Japanese?
Who is that old woman?
"Can you turn on the light, please?"
Follow close behind them.
Don't compare me to my father.
She's not afraid to die.
Tom had a bandage on his forehead.
I'll let you know next Monday.
March comes between February and April.
He looks suspicious.
Water the plants.
Tom slowly sat up.
She got so carried away listening to the Beatles that she missed the date with him.
Our team won the game.
She advised me where to stay.
You have to eat regularly.
The pig's tail is curled.
She was appointed chairperson.
I just finished the work.
You always do the same thing.
Yesterday was very hot and humid.
I came here for a drink.
How late are you open?
Forty people were present.
Her look says that she loves you.
She is a college student.
All of the children came home for Thanksgiving.
He is not as smart as his older brother.
I feel nauseous.
Lunch break is an hour long.
Tom helped Mary to her feet.
The old lady was kind enough to show me the way to the station.
I want to stay in the house.
She met him three years ago.
You have to take the good with the bad.
Feel free to get yourself a drink if you are thirsty.
Tom was in a bad mood today.
I don't feel like working. How about going to a movie instead?
Call me later.
Money can't compensate for life.
Tom spent his money well.
I put the documents you requested on your desk.
Stay in bed until next Monday.
I fail to see the reason.
I want something cold to drink.
Will you be coming this weekend?
I'm sorry to disturb you while you're talking.
Why is your mouth so big?
Tom and I each ate two bananas.
I think it's too big for you.
What should I do?
He resigned from the post.
I don't know. Please ask someone else.
That's where I have to go.
Both my father and my brother are fond of gambling.
We walked ten miles that day.
I'd like you to quickly look over these documents.
I am to meet him at five at the station.
Don't get the phone wet.
I don't want to go to work.
You can get rid of the cold if you take this medicine.
"He gave me 10,000 yen."
I had plenty of time to talk to many friends.
He was jealous of my success.
I want to wash my hands.
The church is in the middle of the village.
Were you disappointed?
What did you do last year on Christmas Day?
I have some good news for you.
Ice cream sells better in the summer than in the winter.
My father set the alarm for six o'clock.
I like reading books.
Did you not understand me?
I didn't care.
I had no difficulty finding your house.
He will be back tomorrow.
I'd buy a new house if I had the money.
Don't tell my father.
My father neither smokes nor drinks.
She still depends on her parents.
My camera broke.
This berry is good to eat.
You can't always have your own way.
Didn't you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
How wide is it?
The job is practically done.
I have no idea how many cousins Tom has.
I want to finish this work by five.
Don't do anything rash.
Please address your mail clearly and correctly.
She can't tell right from wrong.
Really?
He taught history at the school.
Tom has keys to this building.
Why can't we do that now?
What are you going to do?
Don't disturb Tom. He's sleeping.
Is Tom still on a diet?
Tom was real happy.
Tom and Mary are watching TV and eating potato chips.
I'm so fat.
Let me give you a bit of advice.
Most people think so.
That's tofu.
Tom said that he thought that I was dead.
This is a no-win situation.
That was the first time I saw Tom get angry.
I'm very interested in these stories.
Tom is able to speak French.
Tom doesn't think that Mary is attractive.
Three people are missing.
There were fifty passengers on the plane.
There is a florist nearby.
I feel my age.
I did not understand him at all.
I didn't know tofu was this tasty.
It took me three days to finish reading this book.
We used to go to Boston at least once a month.
I don't know how to thank you.
Tom's house was struck by lightning.
We're glad you're coming.
"On Christmas Day, Tom's right leg was still in a cast."
Admission is free for preschool children.
Where are you living now?
"How do you say ""thank you"" in Japanese?"
How about at three o'clock?
"She's not his sister, but his mother."
That question is hard to answer.
I work from Monday through Saturday.
I didn't know that he could speak English.
I have no luck.
"That's normal, isn't it?"
My sister is a secretary at a bank.
He was so tired that he could hardly stand.
I really like you.
I need a favor.
A small gear is missing here.
Today is Tom's birthday.
Take off your school uniform.
"When I heard it, I was dumbfounded."
It can't be true.
Is it a secret?
I was just taking a shower.
They spend a lot of time together.
Permit me to stay.
"If you cook, I'll wash the dishes."
Could you give me some advice?
I often work with Tom.
What is the matter with him?
Can I study here?
I love egg yolks.
There is a good chance that he will win.
How beautiful this flower is!
I don't know the exact place that I was born.
My hobby is music.
Could you put it in plain language?
I'm the law.
Tom was unsteady on his feet.
Tom doesn't get up as early as Mary.
He was sitting on the floor.
Tom prefers home-cooked meals.
Has that been scientifically proven?
How's everything at work?
We import coffee from Brazil.
Tom said that Mary seemed to be drunk.
I don't really understand what you want to say.
"When I hear that song, I think about when I was young."
Tom asked a stupid question.
Now shake hands and make up.
Don't be so childish.
Who's the most intelligent person you know?
Are you ready to go?
I don't want to ruin Tom's holiday.
We are two of a kind.
Tom was relieved to see Mary was OK.
Tom doesn't need to go to school anymore.
Bring that book over here.
I think it's better that way.
It's hard to stay calm in a situation like that.
This is Mary's dog.
"That student runs fast, doesn't he?"
This is the zoom button.
I'll study a lot.
"Ma'am, this is a non-smoking area."
I've traveled many times.
The computer might not work.
Come with me.
You scared me.
Don't use all the hot water.
I'm terribly busy because the report deadline is near.
This is the house that I used to live in.
I'm not looking forward to tomorrow.
No one could answer Tom's question.
How long will you stay in Australia?
Are you sure you remember everything?
Why is everyone making fun of Tom?
They paid separately.
Where can I buy a ticket?
I think Tom hasn't left yet.
Have you heard Tom speaking French?
I don't think you should quit your job.
It's a beautiful day.
Do you play any instruments?
"When traveling, it is easy to get lost."
The shop closes at seven.
"I live in a town, but my parents live in the country."
What time is good for you?
Tom hid behind a tree.
He likes soccer.
I am looking forward to the summer vacation.
My grandfather is very healthy.
I'll take the most expensive one.
I read the whole book in one evening.
Do you want to listen to some music?
Tom tried to stop the bleeding.
He has no children.
Why is French so difficult?
Wait just a minute.
Tom fell from the tree.
He has a lot of acquaintances.
"If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam."
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Can anyone hear me?
I'm lying on the grass.
This is my personal opinion.
You don't need to hurry.
We have a lot to do.
One can't live without water.
I don't like myself.
Tom and Mary don't have children.
All you need to do is write your name and address here.
I've said this many times.
The bus hasn't come yet.
Things like tea and coffee make great gifts for anyone.
"I wanted to talk more, but she just hung up on me."
This fruit doesn't taste good.
We found the key at last.
Where did he go?
Why does Tom want to leave?
I'm here to see Tom.
He stopped smoking.
Strawberries are in season now.
I would also like to rent a car.
Leave the engine running.
I'll do it tomorrow if I can.
Tom walked over to the desk.
Check it out!
I want to hear what Tom thinks.
That isn't wine. It's grape juice.
He is a highly paid man.
The Olympic Games take place every four years.
Tom gave up smoking.
He accepted my idea.
Could you please close the windows?
"Tom tried to swim, but he couldn't."
Would you like me to call a taxi?
His business was only a partial success.
How much is the fare to the Hilton Hotel?
I can't speak French.
Are you sure you don't remember what happened?
She gave me these old coins.
Can Tom speak French?
The poor girl went blind.
Does Tom have a younger brother?
There's a lot to do.
Tom says his stomach still hurts.
I wish we had time.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Can I ask a stupid question?
This bus will take you to the station.
I don't know how old Tom is.
I was too sick to stand.
Life isn't all fun and games.
There is no accounting for tastes.
There are exceptions to every rule.
The movie I watched last night was really scary.
She found it impossible to understand what he was saying.
You can hear sounds in the distance better on clear days than you can on cloudy days.
Please inform me of any change in his condition.
You can trust him to keep his word.
He seems to be a good guy.
Can you meet tonight?
Tom just got home.
The bag has been left behind.
Magazines were lying on the couch.
My mother looks young for her age.
Thanks for telling me.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
The legs of the table are shaky.
Come on in.
We know.
At what time will you be leaving?
It's not really visible to the naked eye.
Tom was in Boston when the war began.
I want to do that by myself.
We were back to square one.
Can you get a day off?
Did you give the key to Tom?
We should be very careful.
I'm Canadian.
Iceland belonged to Denmark.
Just let me get my thoughts in order.
The family was shook up when the grandmother died unexpectedly.
We're prepared for the worst.
This is the house where I was born.
Do as you like.
This is a pun.
It's a woodpecker.
All the schools are closed on that holiday.
Let's speak French.
There were a lot of people in the room.
This novel is difficult to understand.
Why don't we sit?
She picked flowers in the garden.
A bunch of people died in the explosion.
There's a lot to do this afternoon.
I'm scared of my mom.
My dog often lies on the grass.
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
Are you saying you don't know how to do this?
Tom lost seventy pounds.
How far is it to the station?
Swing your arm back and forth.
"Hey sis, can you turn on the light?"
Tom and Mary are from the same city.
Tom said Mary seemed to be drunk.
Tom has left for Boston.
Nobody's told me anything.
I agree to this plan.
Tom is three years older than Mary is.
Where are you going for Christmas vacation?
Tom and Mary plan to get married as soon as they graduate from college.
It's a bit wobbly.
Sometimes I feel like eating stew.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
How are you?
The whole class passed the test.
I'm going to try again.
The air is bad here. Will you open the window?
Everything here is mine.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
"If you have any questions, just ask."
"When you're done, turn the light off."
Have you been listening to me?
Tom was dumped by his girlfriend.
Wash your hands.
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
Tom's translation isn't very good.
He asked for money.
My parents taught me how to drive.
Did you all work together?
I can't tell you anything at this stage.
Tell him to come here.
"Which color do you like more, blue or red?"
All I can do is wait.
Tom will succeed for sure.
Wait here for a while.
A third is less than a half.
Air is to humans what water is to fish.
Is there anything else you'd like?
I'm the one who paid for the tickets.
I bought two pairs of pants.
I have a chill.
I think I'm in danger.
Don't treat me the same way you would treat a child.
I'm sorry. I'm partly responsible for it.
A stroller has been left in front of the store.
She plays tennis in the morning.
Where did you study?
We were caught in a shower.
It snowed last week.
I come every day except Saturday and Sunday.
The students are talking about language and culture.
I don't like studying in this heat.
What's wrong with Tom?
Please lend me this pen.
Why did you lie?
How did you break your arm?
My mom doesn't speak English very well.
Has anything good happened lately?
Could you tell me how to get there?
Tom certainly wasn't fazed by what Mary said.
He was too drunk to drive home.
Please tell us what to do next.
I'll drive you to the post office.
Keep the secret.
We visited Tom in the hospital.
That is a trivial problem.
I need some cash.
I am going to the theater on the corner.
The accident happened all of a sudden.
People are illogical.
That was fun.
She's been very busy.
I'd like to be on TV someday.
Tom lives in the lap of luxury.
There was another silence.
When was printing invented?
"Unfortunately, there was no one around."
I couldn't sleep last night.
Where's your stuff?
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
She gave him a nice present.
I play the guitar in my spare time.
He has a book.
The work must be completed by tomorrow.
Is anything the matter with him?
This pool has six lanes.
My family has lived here for thirty years.
This isn't my first time riding a bicycle.
I slept eight hours last night.
How many seasons are there in a year?
Why are you waiting in line?
It hardly ever rains in the area.
There used to be a house here at one time.
Are you going back to the office?
My girlfriend is five years younger than me.
I'd like to ask you a question.
At what time will you be leaving?
I have a great idea.
I bought this book three days ago.
Tom can't refuse.
I want to get rid of it.
Tom fell down the stairs.
That's not a tiger.
Somebody stole my bag.
The play is based on true events.
Tom said Mary is very drunk.
I have read this book before.
Stop being mean to Tom.
What on earth do you think you're doing?
I didn't understand this part.
You must keep your eyes open.
Tom has done nothing wrong.
I've never broken a bone.
Tickets for today's game sold like hot cakes.
I thought that this might come in handy.
Who's taking care of your kids?
Tom waved his hand.
Have you read the FAQ?
Tom wanted to borrow my car.
Relax.
She is a local government officer.
That old house is thought to be haunted.
"The Joker is the wild card, OK?"
"To tell the truth, I don't agree."
It changed in an instant.
Cookbooks sell well.
There's no way Tom will ever change.
The matter has not been settled yet.
I'm smarter than you.
Just because he's wise doesn't mean that he's honest.
Would you like to wait?
I'm surprised your wife is against it.
Pull the rope tight.
You can use margarine as a substitute for butter.
She has a special way of making bread.
Tom said that he thought that Mary was married.
Armenia joined the World Trade Organization in 2003.
He painted the door blue.
It's in my blood.
Tom is the only man in the world that is likely to break that record.
I've heard that in Germany beer is cheaper than water. Is that true?
"Compared to Tokyo, London is small."
"There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid."
I've decided to leave Boston.
"Some people take a bath every day, and some people don't."
"By the way, did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?"
He told me where to buy origami.
Raise your hand before you answer.
I could've met you at the airport.
I like movies a lot.
"So, what's the problem?"
Can I turn on the lights?
We have a lot of snow in February.
I'll handle the rest.
He is in trouble.
Please pardon me for coming late.
Almost everyone has already left.
It is very kind of you to say so.
How's your sister?
"If I were twenty, I could vote."
There are a lot of students in the library.
The game was postponed because of the bad weather.
My mother told me not to study so much.
I think it'd be better not to do that.
He was shot and seriously wounded.
How old are you?
She wanted him to say that he loved her.
The spy made contact with the enemy.
Tom will be there.
Learning languages is interesting.
We are hungry.
Take the elevator to the fifth floor.
Don't smoke so much.
I remember reading that book when I was a student.
Tom can't tie his own tie.
I hope that neither of them were involved in that traffic accident.
The reason for my silence is there was nothing special to write about.
I make it a rule to take a walk early in the morning.
I can't accept an excuse like that.
I don't want to hide anything from you anymore.
There are many animals in the park.
How old do I look?
I make €100 a day.
She attempted to persuade her father.
This beef is tender.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
I thought that that was the case.
I'd like to work at the cafeteria.
She is not accustomed to driving for a long time.
Attention please!
You will hurt yourself.
Where's the bus stop?
His new movie is disappointing.
He went to bed.
His home run excited the crowd.
Tom talked with Mary yesterday.
Is there anything for me?
Are Tom and Mary getting back together?
Why don't we sit?
Tom fell asleep on the sofa.
"How do you say ""thanks"" in French?"
Vegetables have gotten expensive.
This is a lot more delicious than what Tom usually makes.
We'll all eventually die.
This is the watch I bought yesterday.
I think he is a doctor.
There isn't any milk left.
Tom held his breath for a moment.
Why do you need a new ladder?
I feel like throwing up.
What he said is not true.
When do you usually get up?
It was too dark to see.
Quiet down.
I'm bleeding badly.
She stayed up late to finish sewing your dress.
Who were you waiting for at the station?
"Of all the jams, strawberry jam is my favorite."
How was your summer?
"My town has a population of about 30,000 people."
I enjoy the challenge.
I couldn't restrain myself.
He abandoned the idea.
My mother made me study.
Someone has to tell Tom he should go on a diet.
I had no notion that you were coming.
Could you please introduce yourself?
I'm really happy.
These glasses are mine.
Please don't forget to mail the letters.
He thinks that his success is due to luck.
She's had a hard life.
Tom didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French.
The boy caught the dog by the tail.
Many fish died.
Please ask someone else.
He was startled by the explosion.
I'm not going to hit you.
Is it an illusion?
I have a stomachache.
There's a picture on the wall.
Maybe you're right.
Tom doesn't play the guitar anymore.
I got the ticket for nothing.
"I've seen that play. ""So have I."""
"When I was little, I often played with dolls."
We have to change something.
Why not come and see me tomorrow?
Tom would like to be reincarnated as a woman.
Does he speak English?
I don't really remember what happened.
I have enough money.
A girl sat next to me.
It's six degrees below zero.
Both of my parents have passed away.
The light is out.
Everyone loves that place.
"Thank goodness, you've come to."
A bigger harvest should help offset the expected drop in crop prices.
I think Mary looks better without makeup.
He listened to the news on the radio as he fed his dog.
It's still there.
When was the last time you used a fax machine?
"Last night, I went to bed without brushing my teeth."
What is he running after?
I'm sick of this.
When will he be back?
Why don't you try a little harder?
The pond is 3 meters deep.
Tom is obsessed with trains.
I'm Canadian.
Are you all beginners?
That's a bad sign.
May I sit in the back?
We need to buy a new carpet for this room.
A lot happened in a short time.
I don't think you understood the question.
The thief got away with the money.
Be careful not to fall.
It was less than fifty dollars.
What should I do now?
I'd be willing to help if you need help.
I fell off my bike and scraped my knee.
They arrived too soon.
These apples are huge.
This is all the money that I have now.
I intend to go to the barbershop.
There are no knives.
I go to the dentist every other day.
Please be sure to take one dose three times a day.
He sat reading a book.
I'll take this umbrella.
I have abandoned the idea of buying a house.
Tom says he doesn't have anything to do.
I washed my hands with soap.
Tom quickly fell asleep.
Hug me. I'm scared.
What do you think of my new dress?
I want to do that myself.
He was walking slowly down the street.
I love trips.
Come with me.
These glasses are mine.
The car broke down after half an hour's driving.
Tom is thirty years old.
I'm always interested in new ideas.
Who spread that rumor?
What would you say then?
Tom believes that Mary is innocent.
Tom built this.
Please stop it.
The bill passed the Diet.
Each year is different.
Is this about me?
I really like French.
A male friend of mine called me yesterday.
I want to go with you.
Do you know when they will arrive?
My fountain pen is new.
Tom didn't go fishing.
"Thank you. ""You're welcome."""
"When a child, I used to go fishing with him."
Have you seen my son?
She suddenly fell silent.
"I didn't use to like wine, but now I'm quite fond of it."
I promised I'd do that.
Tom and Mary are smoking cigarettes on the balcony.
I called you here to help me.
Tom and Mary had a romantic dinner to celebrate the first anniversary of their being together.
Tom wants to buy a leather belt.
Don't bite your nails.
I exercised.
Tom considered suicide.
It is obvious that he is right.
I feel empty inside.
The store is open all the year round.
Sales are down this month.
I can't do it.
What's happened?
I can't agree with them on this matter.
Tom had no way of knowing that this would happen.
I never expected to meet her in a place like this.
Tom rescued a boy from drowning last weekend.
They are all alike.
One's dreams do not always come true.
"Because his parents got divorced, Tom had hardly any contact with his father."
Do as you please.
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
They seem to be in love with each other.
It's not true.
I'm satisfied with my work.
I'm not a very good driver.
This book is so easy that even a child can read it.
You must be very hungry now.
One day he went to see the doctor.
I would rather not go.
The lake's surface is almost like a mirror.
Tom has decided to quit smoking.
"To make a long story short, we got married."
"This pen belongs to you, doesn't it?"
Prices depend on supply and demand.
"In the winter, I like to sled down the small hill close to our home."
Tom said that his knees hurt most of the time.
Recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
I'll call later.
She threatened him.
"If you go by bus, you can get there in about one-third of the time."
Tom likes Baroque music.
My airport shuttle bus leaves at six o'clock.
I know what I need to do.
The police are pursuing an escaped prisoner.
I thought that Mary loved me.
Tom has been living in Boston for the last three years.
I was almost asleep.
I slept through the storm.
"Yesterday, I received a letter from my mother."
Please give me a little more time to think about it.
He's been staying at that hotel for the past five days.
She bought a dozen eggs.
Tom was wearing a name tag.
I'm just starving.
You continue making the same mistakes time after time.
I saw a dog.
How long have they been playing tennis?
The emphasis of his talk was on the need to work hard.
Many things kept me from getting much sleep last night.
I have good news.
My memory is failing.
Stop!
This is secret between you and me.
Are you going to run every day?
What is the total number of students?
When did Tom start working here?
Children can make friends with anyone.
You need to respect the elderly.
"You don't need to apologize, Tom."
I have a lot of things I want to do.
This sofa is too small.
No one is allowed in without our permission.
You need to wake up early tomorrow.
I found a nice cup.
Make it a little louder.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
I entered a coffee shop.
He lay on his back.
Something bad was about to happen.
Would you like something to drink?
We don't know why there's more matter than antimatter.
It's getting warmer and warmer.
I rushed to turn on the TV so I wouldn't miss that game.
Would you like to take a break?
That's why so many students are absent today.
"Excuse me, I have work to do."
Are you still living with your mom?
He cast his line into the lake.
The seals are eating fish.
My stepfather treats me better than my real father did.
Tom got worried when he learned about the medicine's side effects.
No one has tried this before.
Tom set me up.
Tom called me a taxi.
There were several students in the classroom.
He had barely enough to eat.
"I love you, Tom."
Good luck on the test!
This is the house where the famous novelist was born.
I love pancakes.
Check the calendar.
The birds are singing in the trees.
"Since I was sick, I didn't go to school."
"If you open the window, bugs will come in."
Are you serious?
Wow!
Don't depend on other people too much.
I have a few essays to write by tomorrow.
You'd better check these points.
Tom didn't have much of a choice.
I can't remember her address no matter how much I try.
I have finished my work.
Mary promised her mother that she would help her more often.
Why can't you come?
Why did you go to bed so early last night?
Tom and Mary talked on the phone.
Don't put off answering the letter.
I've never seen Tom with a girl before.
I asked them to fix my car.
Take anything you want.
You'll have to study harder from now on.
Hurry up. I'm cold.
He cleared his throat.
He is the man you can rely on.
Most of us here don't understand French.
What are you watching?
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
"Tickets are priced at $13, $30, and $33."
I didn't say Tom was to blame.
That girl is my friend.
Tom planted a little peach tree.
He was born rich.
Are you sure you saw someone on the bridge?
My laptop crashed.
"You were late, weren't you?"
You had better go at once.
I was just having lunch.
I'll pay for your lunch today.
He is not so much a novelist as a poet.
He keeps two cats.
I don't remember agreeing to that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I always think of him when I'm alone.
I'm a patient.
It's about time.
What's this chair doing here?
"It all started in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 1, 1955."
Do you have money?
I have no time to read.
Wires transmit electricity.
I want a low table.
Tom wanted to dance.
Tom was playing a game on his phone.
You're half right.
This is a picture I took last week.
Tom was sick of his job.
There were ink blots on the paper.
Tom went to Boston on Monday.
Tom divorced Mary.
Have you been to Boston?
He telephoned me again and again.
Will you please turn down the radio?
I can't eat this much.
Do you know the boy in this picture?
My blood pressure is low.
You should read a lot of books while you're young.
The ground was completely covered with snow.
I think Tom lives in Boston.
Were you at work?
I received a letter in French last week.
The boy begged for a new bicycle.
Is that the man whose wife was killed in the car accident?
It seems to be difficult for her to get along with students in the new school.
Get lost.
Look at the sign right in front of you.
Tom talks like an old man.
I'm too nervous to eat anything.
I like to watch TV.
What time does the club open?
I have to buy a new carpet for this room.
I have time.
The market is bustling.
Gold is a precious metal.
You'll learn in time that a stitch in time saves nine.
Don't go too far out.
I feel light-headed.
I'm bad at swimming.
Why on earth are you here again?
Don't tell anyone.
He has two women in his life.
There was nothing else to do.
Does Tom have a lot of money?
Don't do things halfheartedly.
I'm about to kill the big boss.
What time does the next train leave?
It's not polite to speak with your mouth full.
There were a lot of boats on the lake.
We had a wonderful time tonight.
That man grabbed the young girl's wrist.
Tom isn't scared to die.
"Tom said that he wanted to be alone, and then went up to his room."
He is afraid of dogs.
The doctor can see you at ten on May seventh.
He will be very busy next month.
Don't you have a TV?
"She doesn't get paid by the month, but by the day."
He tried to be brave while he was being held hostage.
This system worked well until the 1840s.
Tom was only using you.
I have a pain in my little toe.
Tom eats breakfast every morning at six o'clock.
Do you hear birds?
Tom smoked a cigarette.
I am responsible for her protection.
I can't bear living alone.
Tom says he won't swim.
Who gave this to you?
A passport is usually necessary when you travel overseas.
There's only one shop that sells this book.
What did you eat for breakfast?
I regret inviting Tom to our wedding.
I need to speak with Tom right away.
Tom was the only one who wasn't sitting.
All you ever do is nitpick. I wish you could say something more constructive.
The best thing to do is to ask an expert to repair it.
Tom exercised.
This river is two hundred kilometers long.
I don't want to go to the hospital.
All that he says is true.
"Getting up at 6 a.m. was hard at first, but now I'm used to it."
Do you think that I'm handsome?
Do you take sugar in your tea?
You've got your priorities backwards.
Is Mrs. Smith an English teacher?
Tom became a police officer.
She must have been very beautiful when she was young.
"Tom is a baseball player, isn't he?"
It's strange that Tom hasn't come yet.
They worked like bees.
Why is Tom so slow?
Do you like rain?
The sky became as dark as if the sun had sunk.
I slowly opened my eyes.
It's the first time that anybody said something like that to me.
The font is too large.
You can't tell Tom what really happened.
"Speak French, OK?"
Is that your sister?
People can't live without air.
Tom always dreamed of becoming a bounty hunter.
I disagree.
Which do you think is correct?
He rested for a while.
This bus can hold fifty people.
Let's split this fifty-fifty.
I'll update you later.
Chuck's Diner is closed on Mondays.
Can you tell me how to do this?
Pick me up at 2:30.
That girl resembles her mother.
It's worth a try.
The baby turned out to be a girl after all.
Her car is two years old.
It's all over for us.
Why are girls so obsessed with clothes?
It's not a difficult problem.
I want to see a volcano.
May I come to see you at your office tomorrow morning?
We are staying at our uncle's.
Jackson said he was not worried about Texas.
I would like you to stay with me.
Those shoes go well with this white skirt.
My father stopped smoking.
I was hoping I'd see her again.
I heard some students complain about the homework.
My legs hurt because I walked a lot today.
What should I say?
I have a lot of questions to answer.
"Fortunately, no one died."
I want something sweet.
Let's sit here on the grass.
I want to drink something cold.
I'm one of Tom's ex-wives.
This is the first time that I've heard that word.
I have 30 students in my class.
I've been writing letters all morning.
Can you come to tonight's meeting?
I asked you if you wanted some help.
We appreciate your hard work.
I'm not busy.
"Yes, I like it very much."
Have a look at that picture.
Ask Tom.
This food is very nutritious.
He has a lot of things to do.
Make it a little bigger.
Do you have an older brother?
See you tomorrow at the library.
She will arrive in Tokyo at the beginning of next month.
It's a great honor to have had the king visit our city.
Tom didn't take his sunglasses off.
"I had a bad cough, so I took the bitter medicine."
The hijacker demanded a ransom of two million dollars.
Don't forget to feed the goldfish.
Look at that picture.
That's very rare.
I've never been better.
"It would be presumptuous to call myself his replacement, but I could offer some guidance."
Tom made no comment.
Tom asked Mary for advice.
Why not try boxing?
It took me five hours to drive there.
I'm not a fan of action movies.
Trust me!
My father came home about ten minutes ago.
He realized the magnitude of his crime.
She cried as she read the letter.
We hurried to catch the bus.
That's a bit of a hassle.
I learned a lot.
Thanks for your reply.
I'm glad I could help you.
"What's the word for ""kaisha"" in English?"
It seems that those two are made for each other.
Don't feel bad. Tom didn't give me a present either.
Do you want to become a father?
I had intended to visit you yesterday.
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
Please don't forget to put out the fire before you go home.
It wasn't until yesterday that I found out the truth.
I have no intention of asking him.
Is the food ready?
I'm going to leave one day early.
Would you like to go abroad?
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight.
Do you have any allergies?
Mind your manners.
My father wants me to study abroad while I'm young.
We went shopping for clothes.
She was burning to tell the secret.
I feel like I've heard that somewhere before.
I'll call you tonight.
Tom couldn't help but agree.
You're bad.
She is responsible for this broken window.
Are you on your way to the station?
I got a video cassette recorder cheap at that shop.
The white ball weighs as much as the red ball.
You should head home.
You should've told me yesterday.
Have you ever considered quitting your job to raise your children?
I turned my steering wheel to the right.
Don't flatter yourself.
"Bill, please."
That's my house.
She let the secret out.
Are you going to eat those cupcakes?
She will have her own way.
She smiled at me.
Please restart your computer.
I thought about giving my saxophone to Tom as a gift.
I'd think twice about this.
I have nothing to do today.
Would you like some more salt on your popcorn?
I think Tom is still hungry.
The shirt is still damp.
I went to the hospital.
Have you ever heard this opera sung in Italian?
Tom always keeps his room clean.
Don't worry about such a trivial problem.
Tom winked.
Coffee is Brazil's main product.
He's apt to forget his promise.
What are you going to tell Tom?
You're still too young to get a driver's license.
Tom likes to show off in front of girls.
Wait. The phone's ringing.
"When Mary was a child, her family was very poor."
I wish I could've been a kid forever.
"When I was younger, I hated going to weddings. My grandmothers and aunts would huddle around me, poke me in the side, and giggle ""You're next! You're next!"" They only stopped this nonsense when I began to do the same thing at funerals."
I competed with him for the first prize.
He made a sharp turn to the right.
Wisdom is better than gold or silver.
Do you want to come along?
Tom is coming to the party as well.
It's OK not to eat it.
He is inclined to get mad.
The first one wasn't the best.
I was asked to deliver this.
He's staying at a hotel.
Tom hasn't regained consciousness yet.
Open your book to page 30.
Do these gloves fit you?
Is it too early to call Tom?
Why can't Tom come?
Don't leave things half done.
I wasn't able to understand anything.
I was encouraged by his words.
Are you planning on getting Tom something for Christmas?
Tom went to the music festival.
Please stick this notice to the door.
I was ashamed of my behavior.
It's not good for you.
Whose car is this?
The baby in the cradle is very cute.
I wish that I didn't have to go to work today.
He passed away yesterday.
Are you dead?
I'll take a nap after lunch.
Do you like the piano?
Summer is the season I like best.
It was very hot inside the bus.
Where are you going so early?
A fish leaped out of the water.
Tom wondered how many times Mary was going to run around the track.
We've had more snow this winter than usual.
Have you finished knitting that sweater?
There's someone waiting for us outside.
You're my only friend.
Tom has very good handwriting.
"I need some paper, pencils, ink and so on."
You'd better eat breakfast.
Tom didn't want to stay home alone.
Have you read today's paper?
May I eat in my room?
I read my horoscope today.
My attitude towards him changed.
When did Mary buy this skirt?
Do you want me to help you look for your keys?
This knife cuts well.
You are a teacher.
I like him.
Wait a bit more.
I want you to see her.
The party was such a great success.
Where can I buy tickets?
Nowadays children don't play outdoors.
Tom quickly opened the drawer and pulled out a gun.
I did so for the sake of my health.
There was only one small problem.
I have a favor to ask.
Tom has to get up early.
That will do.
We shared the cost of the meal.
Let's start.
"I saw a wolf, a fox, and a rabbit."
Those present at the meeting supported the bill.
He saw her and blushed.
He was acquainted with everybody in town.
"To me, skiing is far more interesting than skating."
Are you with Tom?
Are you saying you don't like this?
I don't believe the child came to Tokyo alone.
It was lucky for you that you found it.
I'm sorry I didn't call last night.
My friends scolded me for my stupid behavior.
Is it all right to eat out tonight?
You should rewrite this sentence.
"At this hour, there is incredible traffic."
Dinner's ready!
My name isn't on the list.
What's the bus fare?
The baby was fast asleep.
Where's the post office?
Dinner is ready.
She wants to be a designer.
That is his car.
Let's call Tom.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
There was hardly anyone in the room.
I asked him where he lived.
I almost missed the train.
I'll gladly help you.
I apologized immediately.
Tom isn't interested in horses.
Every person is unique.
You'll catch the bus if you hurry.
I'm amazed at your audacity.
What did you do that for?
"The company, although with some exceptions, usually utilizes its resources very well."
I don't think I'll succeed.
I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
How would you like to pay for it?
I'll go find Tom.
We dislike violence.
Tom isn't a fussy eater.
I fell asleep while listening to the radio.
I forgot to put on my seatbelt.
I think it'd be good if you read this book.
Tom didn't seem interested.
"If you eat your vegetables, you can have ice cream for dessert."
Tom went to Boston.
That's cheap.
I don't feel like doing my math homework now.
I hit the mark with the arrow.
She didn't give me back my money.
Can I have everyone's attention please?
I'm poor at tennis.
Stay away from us.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
He lost all of his money.
I'm good at Japanese.
Tom said Mary was really drunk.
Don't just stand there. Come on in.
Let's go to the river.
I live next door to the toy shop.
Come whenever you want to.
My grandfather was a pharmacist.
I like this pizza.
My girlfriend is older than I am.
Don't worry about the results.
The sea was calm.
He served a ten-year prison term.
We live in the suburbs.
Just a minute.
We've had more snow than usual this winter.
The mouse ran and the cat ran after him.
That's a very good thing.
Please behave prudently.
"If we were to live on the moon, how large would the earth look?"
Tom's the same age as Mary.
"At last, the bus stopped."
I don't like ironing.
I'm not in favor of such a plan.
Where is the closest travel agency?
Tom hasn't called Mary yet.
I'm still very busy.
"Today, I went shopping twice."
I took off my hat and entered the church.
Just wait for me there.
It would be better to stay at home than go out.
This is what I found in the cave.
When is your next train for Boston?
"Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Tom recently."
A stranger spoke to me on the bus.
"It's happened again, hasn't it?"
What is the next class?
Do you want a hot dog?
The children looked interested.
"Tom isn't mad at us, is he?"
Don't tell anyone yet.
Tom got attacked by a swarm of bees.
Do you like coffee?
Leave it to me.
Pick a date.
"Tom is romantic, isn't he?"
Tom enjoys himself at everything he does.
Why are you talking to yourself?
Tom bowed.
Her name is known all over the world.
Don't go near the dog.
I'll have this radio fixed tomorrow.
The king abused his power.
It's OK to cry when you need to.
I couldn't speak French.
Try on another one.
"According to the news, there will be a typhoon tomorrow."
I hate people who do that kind of thing.
There are rumors that he will resign.
Everyone in the room looked bored.
"I'm glad to meet you, too."
Never say never.
"Thank you for helping me. ""Don't mention it."""
My sister is always weighing herself.
Don't put yourself in danger.
Don't listen to her.
He dozed off.
This vending machine takes only hundred-yen coins.
He acted on the stage.
This is my fiancé.
He was heartbroken.
Can I watch television now?
I used to swim here every day.
The water was warm.
This book hasn't yet been translated into French.
I don't belong to anyone.
What's the definition of jazz?
Today is a special day.
"She's not young, is she?"
Tom didn't tell me why he was late.
Tom let me down.
The bridge is thirty meters in width.
We have absolutely nothing in common.
He drank a shot of whiskey.
We hung up the laundry.
They accused him of stealing the bicycle.
Do you have a motorcycle?
There's a sauna and a pool.
It's about three hundred miles from here to Boston.
The rope was a couple of meters too short.
"I didn't know the way, so I looked at the map."
Tom ate a carrot.
I'll be back in a wink.
Who's your favorite character in this book?
I was aching for a cigarette.
All the students were present.
You should have your head examined.
Isn't it good?
Could you please open the window?
This is a waste of time and money.
All of them went there.
He may be sick in bed.
They struggled against the dictator.
I thought I had it all.
That's not a disease.
I like blue more than red.
Do you know Tom's girlfriend's name?
"By the way, what's your address?"
When's Election Day?
That work is mostly done.
Let's move the sofa.
Where is the Japan Airlines counter?
I did nothing illegal.
No way!
Where is the train station?
I'll punch your lights out!
Tom is in the garden now.
She's used to staying up late.
I don't mind waiting for a while.
"You want to do that, don't you?"
Is there something in particular that you want to see?
Tom pointed to the picture on the wall.
He is running now.
Elephants are in danger of dying out.
Tom got back from Australia yesterday.
A monkey ran out in front of our bus.
I'm tied up now. Could you make it later?
Do you have an opinion?
I can't figure out why he said so.
"It's only a short way, so you can walk there in a few minutes."
We've really hit it off.
There's something in my eye.
Call the police!
The smoke alarm has never been maintained.
I'm looking forward to going to the concert.
Tom bought a very cheap camera.
This line shows the longitude.
I prepared for the game by training hard.
We're calling the police.
It's a bit warmer today than usual.
I came early to get a good seat.
I never realized Tom was so stupid.
You'll hurt yourself if you aren't careful.
"Last year, I traveled overseas with some friends."
I got the money back from him.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables.
Could you tell me the way to the station?
Tom has to go to school today.
You can only die once.
I have a friend whose father is a magician.
"Recently, the weather has been bad."
Maybe he won't become famous.
I thought Tom was asleep.
Tom is pulling Mary's hair.
Tom got into his car.
Will you give me a ride to my hotel?
I can't remember the meaning of the word that I looked up yesterday.
I got stuck in a traffic jam on the expressway.
I've been sick in bed since last Monday.
I heard something in the bedroom.
Did you turn off the gas?
Tom took the sheets off the bed and put them in the washing machine.
"Last night, I went to see a movie."
Tom and Mary played hockey.
This tastes a lot better than what Tom usually cooks.
Do you have any small change?
You can sleep late tomorrow morning.
How many ex-wives do you have?
What is considered impolite in one language may not be considered impolite in another language.
We definitely can't win.
I wish I had a room of my own.
Bring it to me.
Let me know if I'm wrong.
Man is the only animal that uses fire.
A screen divided the room into two.
Bacteria are invisible to the naked eye.
It isn't a serious mistake.
Please pass me the salt.
He has a good head on his shoulders.
Do you think that my work is easy?
Can I help in any way?
There are about thirty people in this room.
Sit down and take it easy for a while.
Tom immediately called 911.
The first thing we do when we get up is eat breakfast.
I've made the same mistakes as I made last time.
Don't stand in front of me.
What's your specialty?
Have a nice flight.
There's nothing left in the fridge.
I'm pooped.
Both Tom and Mary agreed with John.
We hear with our ears.
I'm tired of Tom.
Don't run so fast.
He went to stay with his cousin.
Let me introduce you to my parents.
Thank you for coming.
I don't eat as much as you.
Tom wasn't the one who did that.
Tom is making dinner for me.
I've read every book in the library.
My grandfather can't hear very well.
Please give me a hint.
Is there an ATM around here?
How is your sister?
My name isn't on the list.
He took no notice of our warning.
I will be back soon.
I think we'd better wait another thirty minutes.
Please take your hat off.
Tom solved the problem by himself.
Neither you nor I are mistaken.
Where's the restroom?
I'll do my homework.
Tom has moved to Boston.
I'm still a beginner at French.
I've always wanted to try that.
I wonder how Tom got away.
My husband is a very good cook.
Tom repaired the broken radio.
I have a lot of things to do today.
This dog barks a lot.
"At ten past eight this morning, Mary gave birth to healthy triplets."
He has guts.
"Although Tom lives nearby, I rarely see him."
Please fasten your seat belt.
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
Tom sliced the apple.
Did you finish the job?
Don't worry. I'll remember.
What's this supposed to mean?
Is that coffee?
It's raining hard tonight.
How are things at school?
Where has Tom gone?
Someday we'll know the truth.
I like this place.
Tom doesn't seem to have noticed.
"Suddenly, it started to rain."
I thought that that went well.
Do you know whose this is?
Have you ever shaved your legs?
Have you heard from Tom?
This is the worst movie I've ever seen.
Could you do me a favor?
Tom forgot.
They didn't swim because it was cold.
She lives alone.
I bought her a new car.
I know that Tom is from Australia.
I only meant it as a joke.
I never knew his name.
Were you happy at that time?
"You're still mad, aren't you?"
Cars today are amazing.
All these books are mine.
Tom rushed to his room.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I never see this picture without thinking of my father.
"If your parents heard of your success, they would be proud of you."
They stopped talking.
Sit on the sofa and make yourself comfortable.
I want a bottle of Coca-Cola.
It's easy to explain.
Tom often climbs trees.
He failed in spite of his great efforts.
"To tell the truth, I've lost your pen."
There is a glass there.
Are you sure you're ready?
Who do you think he is?
I didn't notice that my wallet was gone until I got home.
That's absurd.
Are you insane?
What kind of camera do you have?
I lived overseas for ten years.
We're looking forward to hearing about your trip.
My father insisted that we should go.
Today's meeting has been canceled.
She helped her daughter get dressed.
It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
How did you solve the problem?
He was hit by a falling rock and died instantly.
Stock investments do not always yield profit.
Shake before using.
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
"Hey, everyone, hurry up."
How long have you known Tom?
I'll do anything.
I'll make breakfast.
My father is very strict with me.
Why didn't you eat lunch today?
I'm going to cook you a nice dinner.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
The government must make fundamental changes.
We're two of a kind.
I missed the train by one minute.
We couldn't go on a picnic because of the rain.
It's too hot.
I don't know her at all.
Are you going to cut down all the trees here?
"What's your name? ""My name is Tom."""
"When I went into his room, he showed me the numerous trophies he had won during the twenty years he had played golf."
I still believe the Internet is not a place for children.
Right now I'm reading a book that has been written in English about French grammar.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Tom thinks I'm a loser.
Please speak as slowly as possible.
I've lived in this town since 1960.
I ate a hasty lunch.
"When a big ape emerged from the cave, they got frightened and ran away."
It's pouring down rain.
I don't feel like smoking today.
You should apologize to your father for not getting home in time for dinner.
Their proposal is out of the question.
He's a sort of painter.
Talk to me!
We have kept in constant touch for twenty years.
It's October.
The field is covered with snow.
Let's hear about it.
We stopped working at noon.
Everyone knows Tom likes Mary.
Tom is very sociable.
I doubt if that's true.
Beethoven's father was a singer.
He's a real gentleman.
Stay away from the windows.
I don't know where to go or what to do.
Are you guys hungry?

Let's have a little break.
Let's eat lunch outside.

He wants to come with us.
Are you waiting for somebody?
She arrived at school on time in spite of the snowstorm.
Would you please pick me up at the hotel on Friday July 11th at 10:00 a.m.?
Is there anything else I need to do?
You're all dressed up. Where are you going?
He ran away at the sight of a policeman.
I think you've gone too far.

I wish I'd brought an umbrella.
Please pass me the salt.
We look forward to seeing you again.

I have two or three pens.
I feel like eating popcorn.
It's a very mountainous country.

Tom got beaten.
I'm pressed for time.
My back and shoulders hurt.
"Hi. You're Tom, right? It's been a while."
It was a very long meeting.

Where do you live?
What's the meaning of this word?

We had a lovely meal.
Tom's native language is French.
He is breathing hard.
I don't want to work anymore.
Why did Tom fail?
We found the boy sound asleep.
Are you on vacation?
"It started raining hard. Because of that, we played inside."
Is that what Tom wanted?
We arrived at the office on time.
What is two times two?
Don't worry about money so much.
"You're angry with me, aren't you?"
Tom's comments are always to the point.
I'd like to buy this doll.
I heard you were sick yesterday.
We made it out of there.
"These flowers aren't only beautiful, but they smell nice."
She asked me if I would be free next Sunday.
We've got a lot to talk about.
We need an answer.

I lived in Boston until I was thirteen years old.
He is complaining about something or other all the time.
"Be careful, please."
It's a beautiful sword.
Would you mind mailing this letter for me?
Tom started to unbutton his shirt.

That's no excuse.
The door must not be left open.
Do you know where Tom died?
I'm sorry that this happened.
Thanks for coming today.
She is very angry with me.
I had lots of time to talk with friends.
We can't turn back.

I'll buy you whatever clothes you want.
I am afraid she may have lost her way.
When did you get the concert ticket?
I read the book. It was very interesting.

Will you show me how to use this camera?

You're going to be OK. Don't worry.
I can see why you like this place so much.
You drink too much coffee.
He goes to the office by car.
I've never traveled abroad.

"It was nice to meet you, and I look forward to hearing from you."
I can't eat pork.
I like hot springs off the beaten track.

My mother gets up earlier than I do.
I won't be home tomorrow.
How's it going with your family?

Some vineyards still choose to irrigate using underground water sources.
"When I was a university student, I always pulled an all-nighter before a test."

I haven't received any notice that she's coming.
Let's go swimming after school.
They suddenly appeared from nowhere.
Mary is convinced that Tom likes her.
I think Tom is too old to be dating my daughter.
I usually get home by six o'clock.

I think you should do it yourself.
She isn't at home now.
I'd like to reconfirm my reservation.
I won first prize.
Tom seemed to be working hard.
I don't like anything Tom does.
I don't like these shoes either.
"Even though it's snowing, I have to go."
I often think about the place where I met you.
I have no idea what it is.
"Yesterday, when Tom was backing up his car, he ran over Mary's bicycle."
There was a tense atmosphere in the room.
I'm afraid there's a little problem.
Are you going to vote?
Isn't it about time you went to bed?
Please sit as close to the front as possible.
We often go skiing in the winter.
This is delicious.
He was absent because of illness.
I believe he is a nice guy.

May I have a moment?
Tom often dreams of his girlfriend.
Tom's opinion isn't needed here.
I didn't know you collected stamps.
Can we apply this rule in this case?
Don't be so mean.
You'll be sorry!

Don't read my journal.
"The great Roman hero, Julius Caesar, was assassinated."
"I like swimming, but I don't want to swim here."
Does Tom work here in Boston?

Don't tell Tom about this.
I love the books by that author.
What's your favorite fruit?
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
"Show me your ticket, please."
He threw the ball to first base.
I'm tired.
It's small and cute.

Is it worth fixing?
About how many books do you have?
This magazine sells well.
I think Tom is in trouble.
His trip will keep him away from the office for a week.
He announced his engagement to her.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
